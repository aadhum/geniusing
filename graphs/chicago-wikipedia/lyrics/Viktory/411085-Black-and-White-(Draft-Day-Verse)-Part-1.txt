I bleach brains Shout! to Cray
Stick to ya' body
Alt-delete, it's a jam in the key
We can prolly touch the streets if everybody would reach
Get it? The flow don't have a limit
2 AM on the track I am poorly bar contended
Andy and Marty are black but light skinneded
And I put a million on it they marrying white women
I'm still coming, i'm the rap game Phil Drummond
Cuz' you know that you can't hang, call it bow tie
I had to do it to ya
I had to do it to ya
I had to do it to ya
I had to do it to ya
If we want a bigger stage more to say
Then why is everybody taking shots poor Lecrae?
