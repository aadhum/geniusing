Don’t open up when he knockin on the doe!
It’ll leave your life stripped like your'e poppin' on a pole
Take every red cent then he holla gotta go
And the body ain't strong cuz' it got a lot of bones
And every single soul you gotta get em' home
Gotta pull your weight, we can’t get it wrong
See, sin and death you got a will to keep that
Trust the king if you wanna release that
Watch the skys
He got a will to be back
In love in the lust but it’s time break up
Alive right now, though He died to save us
Faith so big that it Gotta be global
Don’t trust him and it will be local
Stay in the trap that’s the thing we don’t do
Truth don’t crack, lean back, be hopeful
God stay true everything we go through
Speak the truth they wanna kill me
Don’t wanna play the fool, don’t wanna waste my youth
On a life that will never fulfill me
What’s the reason to keep it if the father been hating it
Put the struggle away up with son where the rest go
Where the enemy can never get the best of me I won’t settle
