Sittin on a quarter P of hay
thangs is feelin good today
I'm tore up, from the floor up
Crown Royal
where everybody smoke they own bud
Silly like I'm hype off candy
I went to visit granny's house, now I see why don't nobody leave
smokin B's
Coldhard finna go in the back of the barn and get my big black peter sucked
Bump my sounds
lay back and roll
mack to the freaks that's on the road
Sometimes I wonder when I was blowed on the streets
Anybody wanna step to me, I'mma see how rough they be
In this session,
manifesting on my P's and Q's
Wildstyle, laughin loud, wit my homies by my side
If somethin jump off let it ride
on my square
when time is live
got the goofies, can't stop grinnin
high like the sun
Nigga come on in, I got some hay, won't you close dat barn door
in
