My connection was the government
They gave me the job
lunatic
Rolling wid a bogus clique
Ran up in the nigga's crib
Didn't think that he was gonna live
Pull the trig, heard him scream
But he didn't die cause he was a fiend
And the nigga ran his mouth
And now I'm locked up
Looking up out the window
Ain't no window
And it's fucked up
Cats
Arm, leg, leg, arms, head
Forgive me for my damn sin
Now I'm facing double life
But life ain't long enough punk
Cause that's to the bodies in my trunk
