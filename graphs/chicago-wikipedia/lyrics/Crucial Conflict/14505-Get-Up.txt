Much trouble passing on the barnyard
Go 'head and bounce and let it go
I'm sick of these soft party cliques on the floor
It's the real rodeo kicking the show
Man I hate ta do this shit
Cause it was my melody
Thought that he called him a bitch
So I up my barrel-y
Didn't have ta hit ya for the homicide
That's why he died
nobody cried
He shouldn't a tried
I'mma mind smoke him up wid tha fives
And a bag a funk
Crucial Conflcit got 'em on cloud nine
Boogie woogie shake it to the left man
toke
