Made his boy burn him up and dared any nigga to trip
If they did you'd see a body shape floatin in a ditch
He couldn't page her and get back his cash; Johnny got mad and put a hit out on em real fast
Johnny
Crucial Times
His momma heartbroken cuz she knew her son was mad
And one day her little baby's gonna be layin in a bodybag
