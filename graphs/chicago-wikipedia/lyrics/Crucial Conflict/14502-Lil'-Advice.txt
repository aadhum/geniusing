I'm manic, dirty, shouldn't hurt me
Hoe trying to play these mind games
Like these trick lames get these bitches rich
I'ma stand on ya ass fast and pass
Watch me hit another lick
Hoe I ain't bout that groupie shit
bogart
Bitch betta have my money laid
Down like a nigga strung out on hay
Bitch wanna know how Never do it
Never did it, now that bitch wid me
Sticking her hands up in ya pockets
Giving me all your fucking profits
And it ain't no thing
I let a hoe know quickly she gotta go
When she getting to attracted to a nigga
Out on the stroll she can have that nigga
Never loving no bitches
Giving me jones that can force me
Kilo's on that hi-tech shit
A bitch will never pimp me
