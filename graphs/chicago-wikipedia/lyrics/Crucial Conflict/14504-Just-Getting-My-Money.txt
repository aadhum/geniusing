Playas hated I can't fade it
3-0-4's
Running wid them renegades stepping in between lines
We rolling up the vibes, stepping in the 9-5
Freaks in The K-T Westside and Chi-Town the best
Bow down, bow-wow yo yippee-yay
Crucial Conflict's got 'em in the barn smoking on hay
Slick
Got my money in my pocket everything is real
To all you MCs, playas indeed, it's the wicked WildStyle
And I'd like ta say peace
