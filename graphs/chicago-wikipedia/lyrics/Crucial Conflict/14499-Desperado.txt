I just can't let it ride
Wanted dead or alive
Bogus way of life
Fools wanna try, why
Hollow point tips hard to dodge
When you lookin' down your enemies barrel
You wish your apparel was camaflouge
Sufferin' succotash
Quicker to bust and blast
Hit your whole clan
With they guns in they hand
Mission is finished
And victory flawless
