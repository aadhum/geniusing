C-H-I-C-A-G-O
Final tic clique
Fatality is reality
If you wondering what is rodeo
THEN SADDLE UP!
For a different adventure
A journey to Chicago
Westside where the hood lie
95 bound
The rooting tooting shooting Maniacs
Banging gats, blunted high
Scandalous, peeping the foes
You gotta know the signs
Load 'em up fast time running out
Turn 'em in turn 'em round
If youz a snitch you betta get a grip
And come equipped for the Final Tic
Let's fight till we hear that final tic
Kill till we kill each other clik
But now we're finna shut your damn mouth
Send your bitch ass back down south
Niggas playing these games like a lame
Get they ass whipped
Beat up and slapped around
Broken legs, pistol whipped
Two eyes out, two busted lips
Teeth knocked out, two busted whips
Bust a cap and jump back and it's on
And I'm gone, ain't got a damn thing to say
Push push and push one more motherfuckin' time
Fuck a bitch fighting ain't the same no more
Push that bitch 6 under zero
Who the role model for Chicago
Kicking down the door wid the rodeo
This is my final tic
In ten more seconds we all might be gone
Four tons of death
Bet a motherfucker now won't touch that mic
Cause he might get this dynamite
Straight from C-H-I, we never die
You know I talk that final tic
