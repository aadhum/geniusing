You know my resume, Skribble Jam, Rap Olympics
I taught the underground how to make a flow great
Juice and Eminem on The Wake Up Show tapes
For most fan, that's when Juice was first seen
I showed the world how to spit it off the head verse clean
Showed emcees what a real verse mean
Way back before I was a name in the game
No rap fame, no fat chain
Now they line up to see Juice when he tours
And for those that stuck with me, I'm exclusively yours
Blaze battle cats try to flock me out of +Ho-Hair+
Another competition for free, don't even go there
I've paid my dues, I slayed my crews
I done ripped everybody, afraid of who?
Tell HBO they gotta pay me when the jet land
Then I show the whole world that I'm the best man
but it went to my man from Minneappolis
All y'all gotta feel J-U when he rappin' this
Eyedea got nothin', I knew this day would come around
When networks and magizines would pimp the underground
??? rappers
I think back to when I battled Super-Nat in two-thou'
Juice's first loss, what's he guna do now?
I held my undefeated rep sacred inside
But like all real Gs, I had to take it in stride
"Juice Was Pre-Wrote"
And I know he sound like Big
When cats try to say your shit is pre-conceived
Nat tried to give me some advice about my flow
He gave me the ultimate respect, and didn't even know
He said - "Stop Writing Your Battle Rhymes & Freestyle More"
I just smiled and thought - "That's What I'll Freestyle For" (haha,y'all
Dont have no idea)
