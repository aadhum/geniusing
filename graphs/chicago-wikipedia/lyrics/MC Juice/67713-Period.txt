[Verse - 1]
battle
I got word chemistry, when I'm dead you'll remember me
Juice, I'll serve any nigga breathing in the industry
Rappers want a piece of me, y'all niggas better stay away (why)
I'll take your rap style and put it back on lay-a-way
I'll cook the second batch then I cook the first batch
And I be knocking rappers down like a purse snatch
"What rapper wanna battle?"
Yeah nigga, I don't care if you got a record deal nigga
