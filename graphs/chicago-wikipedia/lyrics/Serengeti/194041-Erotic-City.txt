[Verse 1]
Wine busted open in my bag
Spilled everywhere, people are so mad
Who always hated tennis
The rackets, the courts, the scoring
The time honored tradition
I sat next to her and told her I would listen
"What are you, a superman?
An ex-marine hero?"
Spend our whole lives
Trying to get them straight
