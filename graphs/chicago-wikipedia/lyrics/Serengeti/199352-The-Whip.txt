In UFC 3
he choked a man with his Gi
In UFC 4,
arm barred by Igor
Said he never tapped,
Give it another shot; under-hooks and learn to dirty box
But while training he popped his MCL
Said he's too old to put his body through this much hell
he fell in love with the wren
Said he had other priorities he'd like to get in
Instead of training, something a little more simple
beasts
So pretty, the way they danced by the mint bushes
A far cry from double X when he pull you pushes
wren Mitch
Around UFC 79 he fell in love with red wine
At the local bar idols, he'd watch fights all the time
Wall of fame; a framed photo from when he used to train
Decided to stay with his step-mom and help her through minor back-pain
Fight night at Idol's
Hey washout, you still think you weren't knocked out?
He replied
It was after a few Merlots so the challenge he obliged
He Walked out first and was attacked from the back
Rear naked choke sunk deep it knocked off his hat
Flashback to the UFC 3
Where if he just would have held on to the technique with the gi
Nightmares about where his life be
Reversed it this time and knocked the punk out with his knee
And winner by K.O.
