I feel like Alonzo Spellman when he went crazy
Hitchhiking in a hospital gown
Until Samurai Mike came and cooled him down
I feel like The Fridge when he met Reagan
I haven't felt this way since Superbowl Twenty
Or that time I met the Beringers outside of Ricobene's
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
I swear O'Douls never made me feel like this
The meat's from Moo and Oinks in the dirt, wash it off
Raise up your flame and put on some extra 'que sauce
I feel like Mongo in '86 in his suite
Hanging out with McMahon after the Bears got beat
I still don't forgive Eric Show to this day
Or Scottie Pippen when told Phil he wouldn't play, like
Ozzie Guillen
Oh, you gonna let Toni Kucoc take the last shot?
Victory Auto Wreckers
"Kenny baby, you know you were drinking Bud Light?
