All you do is accommodate: "What do you like to do?"
I wish that I could find joys in accommodating too
Would you like to be a captain, maybe even be a monster?
Turn me into an imposter, make me more accommodating too
Laying always on the couches, never cleaning up the dishes
Can't appease your simple wishes, take your medicine from your dentist
Broke your favorite coffee cup, said to me "It's only stuff."
Said to me "It's only stuff."
Or maybe I could cook you dinner, stuff you sausage
Make you candles, clean your office
Paint your bedroom disco blue
Accommodating just like you
Teach you how to fly a airplane
Build a hot rod catch a mermaid
Rearrange your room alone
Teach you how to make cologne
Instruct you how to play a bagpipe
Lose some weight and learn to eat right
Wiretap a telephone, extract your own pheromones
Extract your own pheromones
Turn you into an impostor, make you more complicated too
Make you more complicated too
