Favorite actor Dennehy,
favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls
So say goodbye a little longer like I ate a piece of Big Red
Grew a mustache
the size of Mike Ditka's forehead
'85 Bears
Zubaz
walking like my cock hurts
Stacy Adams, no shirt, Jewel's to get a case of Squirt
Her taste really moved me like I ate Juicy Fruit
Chris Penn in Footloose
'85 Walter Roo's
Old Style
My favorite actor was Dennehy long before he played Knight
When Berenger was a substitute
Dave Corzine
Shawon Dunston's
Play softball with the guys,
and orange pop
Sniper 1, 2, and 3, Berenger makes great flicks
Listen to the Shuffle, rewind Richard Dent's part
Back in the damn Buick, I should go to the damn bar
I saw Ditka once on the Edens in a sports car
Take her out to Bennigan's,
Portillo's Italian beef
WCKG
think I'm gonna stop at Zayre's
Baddest of George Throrogood
decent Fiero
Ventures
also the news
Weatherman Skilling
If I was coaching the Bears, we'd at least get ten wins
Ten wins, Dennehy on the O line, Berenger at tight end (Berenger)
