I'm dark, like bitten by a shark
Over her-on spot, it takes over a park
That's scary, look at the monster you married
You never really know someone till you're both buried
Goddammit
You make people nervous
Turn into a serpent, turn into a circus
Or get a new job and realize you can't read
And all the games that kids play
Beat you to death cause humans do not say-Nothing
Off the tracks and on the mat, and oh, it's getting old
I'm harsh, like drowning in a marsh
Sparks
Indie flick-like, but nobody's taping
Fuck it, like Asian towns in the jungle
