The only way you lose weight:
If you start to smoke coke
Where wifes have face jobs
And husbands drive Maseratis
"Ugh! I'm so bored
I don't wanna go skiing"
The fabulous North Shore:
the lake
"OK, Sport! Kiddo!
'Ey you're a winner!"
Dirty Heat
Said we couldn't stay there no more
We left her pad too messy
And it was all on Rod
Constantly smoking weed and
Speeches how he found God
(???)
"That's God,"
Wolverine rejuvenation
Judy Blume wrote Freckle Juice
(fuck! I fucked up!)
