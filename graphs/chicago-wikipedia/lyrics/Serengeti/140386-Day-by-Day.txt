That not being big shit and not lovin' obscurity
Keep it real in rap, don't mess with maturity
People get older, mountain boulders
When ridin' the ropes starts to mess with your back and shoulder
Keep on with the keep on, keep on
Keep on
Shitty shit to sleep on
glasses
To buy us time
Day By day
No matter where you are
I will be a heartbeat
Away from you
