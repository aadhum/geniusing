And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength it overwhelmed the boy
Coin collections, camcorders and silverware
Estrangulacións, police called on the au pair
She’s been stressed since Jess left, that automatic withdrawal
A couple belts, several stripes
Poor little Charles
She just sits around and talks
And thought it’s totally Ginger’s fault, that her child couldn’t walk
Had to get another gig
Quick temper with little Chuck
Dreams of just returns were once cuddled by the bottle worm
