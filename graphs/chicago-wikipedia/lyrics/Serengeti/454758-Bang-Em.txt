Potatoes carrots eyes strengthen
O'Neal - retired
Makin' bacon, Kevin dancin'
Green bottles
Bottles clean
T is Latanya
It's the Deacon Kenny speakin'
Step to Tha Teachaz
I told you the KDz
Kill like the Deacon
Michael Dudikoff: American Ninja
We are in tune to the KDz Killa Deacon
[?]
Step to the Deacon
Whole face leaking we'll see your girl screaming
You don't want that 'n'
I don't want that
I'm a peaceful man
And though I ain't no beacon
Alright I ain't no vegan
Props to the vegan respects to 'em but I ain't no vegan
