Quick, let me get drunk as fast as I can
So, I can fall asleep
And pretend to be a different man
You know, the one that’s an architect
Is this a case of the grass is greener or is the shit more fresh?
I'd say the latter
like Gargamel
The only saving grace was that he did a song with Jel
I wanna be on film, too, so I hired a film crew
I also got taken by the gypsies in Berlin, too
No marble, we’re like twins, dark corner in basketball courts with meants
'87 Cubs
I love Hawk Dawson
I have a huge nose like that woman on Blossom
Peeps to Jel and my man Odd Nosdam
I made it to the orange belt on Shotokan karate
My favorite show is tennis!
Often on tilt, Often off balance
I'm getting older, so I hang around MILFs
