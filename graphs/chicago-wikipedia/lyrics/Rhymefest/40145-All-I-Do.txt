Mr. Blue Collar
You can take the boy outta slum, can't take slum outta son
I should be lynched, I'm so high-strung
Take a trip to the city of wind, the city of sin
My block'll have you born again
But it ain't like church, life hurts
she stuffin rocks down her baby's diapers

All I do - workin hard from scratch
And stay hungry to the death I will starve my-self
