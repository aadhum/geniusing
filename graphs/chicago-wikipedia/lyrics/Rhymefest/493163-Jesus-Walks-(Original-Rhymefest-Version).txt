I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the Grammys
Thank you God, now I can sin again!
I had the "Jesus Walks" sample and a dope idea
If K hook it up then this could be the song of the year
So I give my nigga the sample and the joint took off
But the verse that 'Fest did somehow got lost
Somewhere got tossed
Homie, I ain't mad at ya, doin' your thing
Let every man be his own king
With no fear ladies and gents
What you finna hear
"Jesus Walks" Rhymefest verse world premiere
[Hook]
(Jesus walks)
God show me the way cause the Devil trying to break me down
(Jesus walks with me)
And the only thing that I pray is that my feet don't fail me now
You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
My niggas had Nikes, I had Pro Wings shell toes
Kids knew it was Payless, Footlocker ain't sell those
I got a girl that ain't my girl
That got my baby so she bug me
She ain't even cute so my baby probly ugly
My granny think I'm crazy, the streets is a virus
Sometimes I just want to rest in peace like Osiris
Wait, rest in peace like Osiris
