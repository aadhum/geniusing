The boys in blue, I'll show you what the brass is like
Blue collar rap, why I call it that?
Shit I know more real niggas at U-Haul than hauled crack
"You a soft-ass nigga, you a mark, you a gump
Fuckin lame, you a coward, you a punk, you a chuuump"
Where how you wear yo' hat made you prone to attack
Probably wearin a wire, so I don't even talk to ya
You think these niggas is thugs, they officers
