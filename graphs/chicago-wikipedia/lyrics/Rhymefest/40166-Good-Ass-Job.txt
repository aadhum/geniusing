Man I was sick of them bill collectors callin' my crib
And the filthy ass roaches tryin' to crawl in my shit (all in a nigga's cereal)
See I spit now, now these hoes all on my dick (oh you're a rapper?!)
Like "Mikkey won't you take me out?"
Chick please, it takes more than a rat to get cheese
You can lick deez
I worked hard to get G's
You can strip tease
That's too freaky? Well bitch leave!
Cause chickens keep talkin' in the streets nigga
I just got a good ass job
The pay is good but the work is too hard
Run up in they crib for the safe and the keys
Y'all ain't safe around me
And still get pulled over for "drivin' while black"
While back bill collectors call
We ain't answer ("He ain't here")
Light company will have to come and blow out our candles
I Dream Cash like Sega
This spins a lot different from the Cutlass I was whippin'
Got beef? Pop the clip in
Only a bitch would worry about his obituary
A king on a slave ship
Workin' the grave shift and ain't even made shit
