Ayo, rippin' y'all niggas is the easiest
Y'all style is the nacho cheesiest
Everybody wanna shine, they the greasiest
When they know they bank account is the measliest
My niggas come in all black like deep space
When we turn the toast
Turn you to a ghost
Any more want they girl to play Demi Moore?
[Hook]
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Even if you gotta slug it out
If you gotta thug it out, thug it out
"I can fight with the best"
Don't let 'em hold you down nigga
"But I can only go"
You can go another round nigga
"So many rounds"
Bullets trimmin' the side of your head like crew cut
