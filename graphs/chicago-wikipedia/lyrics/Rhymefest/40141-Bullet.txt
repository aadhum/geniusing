Straight outta highschool he didn't know what to do
Wanted to go to college but no money was nothing new
Wanted to get away go see the world and do something new
He got approached in the mall by the army recruit
Told him
"If you wanna go to school we got money too
Sign up at eighteen you be out when you twenty-two"
He joined the army airborne
Got his uniform went to bootcamp got some discipline
Iraq is where they shipped him
He's in the middle of bullets flyin' and missin him
Wishing he was a kid again with his family in Michigan
In the midst of fighting militiamen, one round took down six of them
He ain't really a killer though, taking a lot of risks
This is what a poor person do for a scholarship
He turned around and got a face full of hollow-tips
But don't be mad, he died for the flag
[Hook: Citizen Cope]
Now what you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away
What you've done here, is put yourself between a bullet and a target
And it won't be long before, you're pullin' yourself away
Papa was a playa
knew just what to say ta'
Get the women back to his lair, and lay her
If sex had a trophy he's the Heisman, touchdown
Hitting models and R&B chicks and bust-downs
He took 'em all put 'em in a line
He thought they were fine
Got head from five dope-fiends smoking a dime
raw dog
Til' he woke up one season with lesions
He went to the doctor asked him what was the reason
The test read positive he couldn't believe it
He tried to blame God asking why did he leave him
Pleading please let the disease leave him
From women that he conquered, he caught the monster
Now when the sun goes down, on our side of town
On the other side of the block, when cops ain't around
On the same side of the street that 'Pac hit the ground
Not in Vegas, cause every nigga got 'Pac in him now
When my guys hit the block, and we proving we thugs
I ain't on no swim team but you see pools of blood
Skip Judy when you die, she ain't whose the judge
Oh you married to game then prove your love
Here's a strap shorty, shoot it do it just do it
See my girl think I'm hard, and my Momma think I'm hard
But when I'm all up in the dark I just fall on my knees
