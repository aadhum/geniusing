Andy C where you at?
You can go against the guns but the Glocks gon' win
"'I sweat it live
Is he gonna live doc?'
'No, the nigga died.'"
You know how that song go
"Some things will never change"
Some niggas will never grow like Emmanuel Lewis
Like Prudential, all these smokers want a piece of the rock
And I ain't Q-Tip but I'll make your breathin' stop
