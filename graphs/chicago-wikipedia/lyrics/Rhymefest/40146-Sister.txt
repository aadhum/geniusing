Don't ask for money, you done ten dollar'd me out
I even took yo' kids when they put you out the last house
But I will not babysit while you in a crackhouse!
And I would hate, to turn 'em over to the state
Look what I did, I let they bad-ass stay and just tear up my crib
While you hurt me child, horribly
He asked me why my momma love drugs more than me
I couldn't answer, I sat back and peered in the sky
I thought it was rainin, but damn, there was tears in my eyes
He was like you gon' be alright Uncle Che?
I'm like man, look
