My lifetime line
Is every line you repeat
A piece of my soul designed for you to keep
Make your own meal
Fuck waitin' for an alley-oop
Get up off your ass and work on your jump shot
Get high nigga
Don't try to con me, baby what's your angle?
Maybe I'm paranoid
Thinkin' bout the past tense
Cause in the past, real love took an absence
