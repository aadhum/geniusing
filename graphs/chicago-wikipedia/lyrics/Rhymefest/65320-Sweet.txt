I don't like it unless it's brand new
You might catch me in my brand new whip
Tokyo Drift
Neighborhood fucked up since we got off that black boat
Obama must be a stone, cause he ain't really black, folks
My pipe dreams turned into crack hopes
Everybody's high blown when they start to tax dope
Uncle Sam taxing for every gram you hand out
So how that coke in the pot supposed to pan out
When if you don't pay, they take everything in the damn house
I could talk about how fresh I am
Ghetto Black Eyed Peas, you could call me Yes.I.Am
Chi-town,
I'ma run for alderman, "There he goes again"
