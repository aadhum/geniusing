{"Oh someday... no I ain't wastin no more tiiiime"}
Southside step up, and get you a slice
Eastside step up, and get you a slice
Westside step up, and get you a slice
Northside step up, and get you a slice
Chi-Town step up, and get you a slice
L.A. step up, and get you a slice
N.Y. step up, and get you a slice
It's just a slice of the devil's pie, ah-c'mon
Look; times is hard, life is hard
I lost my job, baby oh my God
My wife is nauseous, she pregnant as hell
My mistress on the cell sayin she gon' tell
My Uncle in the cell sayin he want bail
My granddaddy can't see, claimin he need Braille
I'm fightin for strength, in the street grindin for cents
I know I'm ahead of my time but I'm behind on my rent
Askin Kanye for money just to pay on my gas bill
He asked me for it back, nigga brush up on your math skills
Nothin plus zip equals zero;
he couldn't relate
That nigga ain't been broke since "H to the Izzo"
That's whem my man Biddle stopped by with two little
Pills I could put in the bag and sell like Skittles
One for ten, fifteen for two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do?
Take a neighborhood full of hongry blacks
Within 3 beeper shops, 2 liquor stores and one laundromat
No banks, just a Check'n'Go, everywhere you go
We gon' make a tasty pastry, that you can't get in a bakery
I picture hopelessness from slavery {*gasp*}
Can you smell it yet, a few churches that almost care
I know you heathens ready to eat, we almost there
Somebody pass a couple of gangs of Glocks
Politicians are quick to cop, sprinkle pie me on the top
While I, couldn't be faster, recipe for disaster
Gunshots is the devil's laughter
Overcrowded jails puttin pounds on Ashcroft
Young males plays the judge and jury
Slingin them O's
Bust some nines, on anybody fuckin with mine
Yo Mark, get out here nigga
