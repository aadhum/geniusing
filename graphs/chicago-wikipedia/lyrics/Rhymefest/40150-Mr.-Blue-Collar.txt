Imagine you was hustlin'
The Romans came in, and somehow you was able to evade the search
This just means your grandmama must've really, really prayed in church
Maybe it's time for you to trade in merch for a blue collar
And why do them fake media keep feeding you lies and tellin' you that
All the Blacks and Latinos is out here smugglin'
