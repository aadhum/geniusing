I wanna bust some heads
I'd rather lie in the bed
Im out tryna get love
I'm just up in the strip club
I feel like crying
I feel like dying
I wanna spaz out
Throw a brick through a sucker ass nigga glasshouse
My baby momma just don't understand
I ain't rich bitch it's just an advance
but she know
She better off with some of these niggas
Whose baby dads don't even care for these kids
I don't kick it wit cowards, this my career you just rap in the shower
You ain't ready to ride, get your ass out that impala... Holla!
I'm on my grind, be back in an hour
I'm like a bully up in the class, whose waiting for a chance to whoop yo ass
I ain't innocent, Jesus walked me to the Grammys
Thank you God, now I can sin again!
I feel like Puff Daddy lied, cause I ain't vote and I ain't die
I ain't a hypocrite, I hate rap music, I just love my shit
Kanye, Common, Twista, that's it
But then again, I kinda like Eminem, he be funny and dissin'
I bought his record, it's a one time listen
But if I get a dark Italian girl, it just might pass -
This ain't hate this is tough love
I'm feelin' like (some of these) police is so obese
Always eatin' fast food, sugary snacks, the pounds they pullin'
Can't run so they chase niggas down with bullets
I guess the real criminal be the one with the badge
