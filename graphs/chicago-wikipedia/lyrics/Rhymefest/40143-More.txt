No matter how much I get (I want mooore)
Every party on every list
And everybody want a life like this
But still (I want more)
You think these rappers rich? These niggas out here sellin dope
Like Milli Vanilli, now people just look at him silly
Between me and you, now this mano a mano
Now you lookin like the clown like Ronald
That's where Kells fucked up, cause young girls he decided to fondle
And I ain't fin' ta let HIV zip my bag
I started usin' rubbers again, it ain't that bad
You gotta take care of yourself mayne, don't get grabbed
Cause if you die, people be like "Aww that's too bad"
Tryin to act like, like, you reppin the street
You ain't a gangsta, you a bitch with a beat
