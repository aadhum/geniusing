love
If I kept it trill and told you that I need my space
You irritate me, every time you show up at my place
What if I told you that you bore me and it's no longer fun
And why we talking, I been texting two niggas at one
What if I told you that I care, but I don't care enough
Told him it was on silent, but it wasn't
I just ain't pick up
And I really don't give no fucks, love has been erased
I had to clear out all our memories, this shit can't be saved
