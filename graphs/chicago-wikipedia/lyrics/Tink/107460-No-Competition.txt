I know y'all I ain't think I was gone drop a tape
And not put a fucking freestyle on that bitch
I know a couple of niggas
They put a price on your head
They can’t locate your mama
They kill the sister instead
Leave you leaking like faucets
Touch the line but don’t cross it
If a bitch work my nerves
I’ll beat her ass in that office
I’m that bitch in your city
Don’t act like you ain’t know
I dropped a tape in the winter
So fucking cold that it snow
I mean I’m younger than most
But I got plug with the vets
Like you depressed
Or half dressed
Tell these hoes get it together
Cause I got clips just like Zae
I need a mil like after Meek
Sporting J’s like where’s Stevie?
You niggas scared like y’all home alone
Toss money like a fucking salad
