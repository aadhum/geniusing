[Intro: Aaliyah]
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feeling
All...
Million, million
Tink
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
Tink
Cause you touch my spirit, can you feel it, give me that
There's a passion for it, can't ignore it, give me that, love
Cause your love give me goosebumps
You're the right one when I need some, I call you
Real love never gives up on a Tuesday
If it does rain, you come through
Your love's like a big hug on a bad day
Just what I need in my life
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
Your love's what I breathe from, I would go numb
If you left me here right now
Our love gets stronger when we break up
We'll be right back in no time
And our love's made of concrete when you rock me
I just feel so safe and
Like a million, million, million, people told me
Not to trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah
I fuck with you, in love with you, I run with you, oh yeah
Your love's like my drug, I can't live without it
That's just what you do to me boy
For your love I'd proudly climb a mountain
Cause that's just what you do to me boy
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
You are, yeah, yeah, you are
One in a million, one in a million, one in a million to me
Tink
A million, million, million, people told me not
To trust in you
But there's a million, million, million, million reasons why
I fuck with you
