Ain't nothing wrong, falling in love
Ain't nothing wrong
Lullaby lullaby lullaby
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you never dreamed
You ease my mind like a lulla-lullaby
La la la la, la la la la, you ease my mind like a lullaby
Words can’t explain this vibe that you've given me baby
Above every ocean higher than a soaring place
Is where you’ll find me and my baby
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you've never dreamed
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I’m gonna sing oh so sweet, boy you make my heart skip a beat
(Lullaby lullaby lullaby)
I don’t wanna open my eyes, you give me life
You ease my mind like a lulla-lullaby
La la la la, la la la la, you ease my mind like a lullaby
Three little words but they mean too much (x2)
Where would I be at without your love (x2)
The money don’t mean nothing, Ill still ride till the wheels fall off
most of these girls they don’t want your heart
They wanna waste your time, I’m just so glad you're mine
You make me wanna cry lulla-lullaby
I’m gonna be, I’m gonna be everything you never dreamed
