I like niggas in Tru
I like niggas in Timbs
That nigga rockin' Burberry
Fuck niggas ain't rockin' with em'
I'm beastin' on every track
My pockets ain't ever flat
All my bitches bad tho
Probably why these niggas thirsty, ya'll been on that shower flow
Heard you had a foreign whip
Own place with his own car
Buy his own shit, it ain’t nothin’ fake
She cook, clean, fuck, and she do the dishes
