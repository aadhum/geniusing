I tell you all my secrets cause I know you keep them
I share with you my dreams cause you help me reach them
Can’t live without you so I’m praying we just die together
It’s fuck the weather I tell you we been through everything
The only difference is we ain’t wearing no wedding rings
But I’m waiting so patient ain’t no need for rushing
Let me just admire you
I need you need you need you need you
