Verse 1
Iâ€™m loving the moment
If you just have the time Spend it here with me
Dont worry bout your past or my history
Cause that don't even matter
When you're here with me
I just want your time
I Don't think it's too much to ask from my personal view
If I give you one hundred, then you gotta give me that too
I just want your company, wondering if you want mine
I'm not asking for much...
I just want your time
Time, time, time, time, your time (x2)
If you just have the time
Spend it here with me
Dont worry bout your past or my history
Cause that don't even matter
When you're here with me
I just want your time
If I give you 100, then you gotta give me that too
I just want your company, wondering if you want mine
I'm not asking for much...
I just want your time
Time, time, time, time, your time (x2)
