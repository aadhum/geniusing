Never needed me a leash
These niggas need me and that's that
To be a hunnid with the truth
These niggas hoe and I'm already knowin'
That ain't nothin' new
Just don't never get attached
They be right here running back
2015
Niggas is niggas, you know how they are
Let his mind wonder when you're gone
And if you let it ring for like a couple of times
He'll be thinkin' bout what got you occupied
Put no nigga before your money
Bet he wanna fuck with me again
One night night only (only)
What you can do for me, I can do for myself
right about now it
I don't have the time, to commit
