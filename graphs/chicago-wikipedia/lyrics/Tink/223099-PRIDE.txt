You're in love with another girl
And i'm so fucking
jealous
To know you care for her, and no other girl
Talkin' bout oooh, she don't appreciate you
I try, I try, to speak my mind (yeah)
But the words, the words never come out
I'm dying each night, cause your not by my side
And I wanna say whats inside (whats inside)
But I got way to much pride
I miss your voice and texts at night , I think about them daily
Do you think of me at anytime?
I'll never find no one better and ooh we belong together
