Switch it up, dropping names
Man dat shit ain't me
Lot of niggas fake, and I show em' no love
I keep it real
These fake niggas playing both sides
They in the middle that's an Altoid
But man I'm international
Don't fuck with snakes, like Samuel
Coolin' with shake
Gotta pay me for a verse, man dat shit ain't free
I never wife a thot, man dat shit ain't me
Overseas, my cars they foreign
Don't pay em no attention, ignorance
My bitch she bad
I keep my gun on fightin'
