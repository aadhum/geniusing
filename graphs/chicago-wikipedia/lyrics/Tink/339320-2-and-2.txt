Ooh (2 and 2)
Why when we talk it feel so forced
Why when I ask what it is, you get hoarsed
Who you been, fucking on
And why you never pick up while you're not alone
Where the hell you been if you're not at home
Who you been, fucking on
I wouldn't be surprised
You're lying laying in between my thighs
Telling me, she ain't nobody
(Think I believe that)
I'd done put 2 and 2 together
And I can put up with you
Oh, 2 and 2
Now why when I yell, you don't hear a word
