The change to my pocket
My life vest when I'm in the deep end
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
Ooooo oooo ooo ooo gravity
You put the smile in my cheek bones
You are the one that I need close
You're the lace to my shoes
Cup to my booze
One that I call late night when I'm loose
Stars to my sky
Reason that I dropped off every other guy
Only man that has my eyes
I just enjoy, your sense of humor
You're like a tumor
You're in my head all day
You rock my world like outer space
