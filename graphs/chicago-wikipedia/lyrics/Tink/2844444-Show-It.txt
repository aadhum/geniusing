Let's go live, what's to hide
What's the point in calling me your main bitch, when you can't even show it, show it, show it (Show it, show it, show it)
I need a little more proof from you
Your sides gotten way too quiet
Actions speak louder
Can't understand these niggas like they foreign
Cause I know you don't deserve me
But I'd be a fool, to ever leave (To ever leave)
You're all I got
It's all that I need
Let's go live, what's to hide
Actions speak louder
I'm reaching out to you but there's no answer when I call
Why does everything revolve around you?
