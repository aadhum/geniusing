When it’s dark outside and my body gets cold
You see this lightning and thunder, wanna get up under
Underneath my covers, it’s crazy what we do when
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
When it rains, when it rains, when it rains babe
Have you calling up your ex baby I need that right now
Have you scrolling through your texts, thinking about how we laid it down
You feeling my body, you making me naughty, I’m doing everything I don’t do
It must be the weather that brought us together cause baby, it just makes me want you
It’s pouring down, pouring down, pouring down
All over your face babe
I just wanna hear my body shouting
