Don't shoot
Tell the children to watch out, watch out
Don't shoot
Don't shoot
They have complete domain over us, they are like Gods. If they tell you not to do something, you cannot do it. And if you do, they will treat you like a dog. You will be shot down. Well at least for a black man, I'm not sure for everybody but I do understand that, I hope it's not like that for everyone
Plot twists, just nana, me and the kids
We in the crib, it's a quarter past ten
"Where your brother at?" Run up in his room, pulled the cover back
Where I'm from niggas leave the porch and they don't make it back
Police light, nana starts pacing
"Fuck the pigs want, what brings you here on this occasion?"
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow
Boys been gunned down, your boys is having fun now
With our blood and our sons, disturbing the peace
He's more afraid of him when he's the one with the piece?
Aaah, nana drop, she hollering "Why God?!"
Police be telling us it's nothing but their job
Then they wonder why we grow up being prejudice and so violent
They'll fuck with you cause they can't believe that it's yours
Registration
They wanna take us out so they start making allegations
I'm fed up
Police coming so we sped up
My nana told me "fuck twelve keep yo' head up"
King died for us niggas living in poverty
50 years later we still don't have equality, it bothers me
A badge is a pass to do whatever
So now we living in fear of the people here to protect us
The problem when nobody sees the view from our perspective
My people shed blood from the acres you had stole
Now my people shedding blood on the gravel left in the cold
