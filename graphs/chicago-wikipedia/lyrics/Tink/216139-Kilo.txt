My name hold weight like a kilo
Yo nigga a zero
Self-made bitch, I don't need no fuckin' hero I got bank roll
Verses put me on, now 'ima blow this money 'till it's gone (x2)
My name hold weight like a kilo
Yo nigga a zero
Self-made bitch, I don't need no fuckin' hero I got bank roll
Verses put me on, now I'ma blow this money 'till it's gone
Got more toys than a spoiled brat, playin' games that'll get you clapped
3 fingers, East Side
Weak bitches gon' talk shit but a real bitch ain't gon' let it slide

Runnin' shit like Nino
my plug named Carlito
My niggas hot in these streets
Ball hard like D.Rose, this rap shit like free throws
Yo boyfriend a zero, I'm rollin' off a hero, yo baby-mama she deep-throat
I'm all about them figures, ridin' 'round with my niggas
I only fuck with them killas', and a couple dope dealas'
Pockets filled with them bank rolls, hunnit thousand, can't fold
Bibby got that straight drop just ask around bet they know
I'm feelin' like the shit, these verses gettin' me rich
And I don't fuck with no squares, unless you talkin' 'bout bricks
I be goin' hard no time off, these lil' niggas they rhyme soft
Play with me I let the nine off, commit a homicide then ride off

Yeah my name hold weight that's what my bars say
Young nigga that's runnin' 'bout all 'em apes no I 'ain't Tarzan
If I can get 'em my squad can
