Can we fly away
from home
Flame a blunt up on the beach
Can we lay down in the sand and
Write our names under our feet
Can we hold each other's hands
Can we cancel all our plans
Can we make a little time
Just for me and you
I gotta just get away
From all these issues at the crib
I love you cause I trust you
Not to judge me for my sins
I swear I didn't see it
Cause at first I ain't believe it
I think I found a man
That never once gave me a reason to:
Wanna leave, and I bleed
When he's away from me
