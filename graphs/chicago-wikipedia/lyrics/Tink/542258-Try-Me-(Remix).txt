I'ma get him gone like Illuminati
30 make him yell like he a soprano
Lay them boys down like a lot of dominoes
Run up in his crib like Mr. Rogers
Flip his ass quick put him in gymnastics
Tell Lil Durk let's have a party with my lil shawtys
We ain't getting drunk, but they bringing 40s
I could murder with my fashion you niggas lacking
About to drop a body feel like I'm contracting
Youngest bitch fucking up these streets like my name was North West
My bitches don't want to talk like a case of strep throat
We rather just get up on it, word to fucking Dej Loaf
Kill a nigga in a week call it that ebola
Leave a pussy wet like we having foreplay
Have you ever seen amounts longer than your zip code?
Lean upon myself, rest in peace to Pimp C
Racked up no double D's
he say it's the bomb
But I'm not Islamic
You know I'm from the Chi, where they bang corners
Heads upon the ground like we tossing quarters
These niggas sweeter than duck lips
Doing all that dickriding, you still driving that Honda
I don't play about my blood like a diabetic
Swear to God
The only thing I'm waiting on
