All I wanna know is why y'all fake with me (they fake)
Show love in the club
Turn around go back and hate on me (fuck em)
I'm just getting money while I'm still alive
Said my tape wouldn't do numbers
But be first to cop it
Niggas ain't been loyal though
Turned on me with no remorse
Sneak dissing, hoping I choke
Secretly hoping I won't
You niggas intimidated
They say my bars overrated
Bitches want what I'm getting
Counting blessings while sending
I respect those who grind
You niggas ain't friends
You niggas ain't real
You niggas be fake
