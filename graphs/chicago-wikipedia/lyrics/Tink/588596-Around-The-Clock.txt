Charlamagne Tha God
A wise man told me the first step towards change is awareness, the second step is acceptance
Are you aware of the changes that are happening around you? Are you willing to accept the change that is upon us?
Cash rules everything around me
Tell them broke boys get the fuck from 'round me
I'm more into the ballers, don't look at me like I'm Draya
I'm comin' heavy as a pound, these niggas still on the gram
All I think about is time
I need it around the clock
I need it around the clock
I'ma blow right at your top, John Kennedy
Yahweh pockets on grande
I need a nigga with some power, movin' forward, Dwight Howard
