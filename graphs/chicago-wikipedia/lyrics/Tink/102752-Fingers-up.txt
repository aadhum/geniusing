Fingers up
Don't give a fuck
They know what's up
When I put them fingers up
Fingers up
Don't give a fuck
They know what's up
I know
That these niggas kind of fake
Why these bitches all in my face
When they know I don't Parlay
They know
I'm so used to going H.A.M
I don't really give a damn
Put your fingers up
Okay, hands up with a middle finger
Let 'em know I don't give a fuck
I heard I got a little competition
Therefore she ain't big enough
Big enough
Yo' money ain't
I'm serving hoes
No dinner plates
I'm out here doing my damn thing
So they honor me
I'm like a holiday
Memorials cuz' it's R.I.P
Fuck we need to talk for
I'm just tryna get paid
Call these rappers Ceily
All they life they been sneak dissing
Two headed dog
