Slam your brakes when I walk through the place
Scoot down the line if you wanna get inside
Open up two tabs
Drinks on me like a belly shot
Work that
You gotta wham that
You gotta make a nigga wanna know where ya makin' plans at
Downtown livin' at the Trump
He was a married man â€™til he gave me a ring
The bar's up high so if you not at least 6'5"
Then you might as well not even apply
Rule number uno: keep that uh-uh tight
You know he all yours if you movin' up on the floor
And he looks back twice
