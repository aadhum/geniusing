My boyfriend is my bestfriend, and my bestfriend is my better half
He motivate me when I'm feeling lazy, he the best thing that I ever had
He know my flaws and he know my past
But it never matters cause he still with me
It feel good to have you by my side
On them cold nights when I don't feel pretty
Them old nights when I shed tears
Cause I heard the things that them niggas said
I ran to you, when I laid with you
And you never ask whats in between my legs
You never judge me for the things I did
You heard the rumors, but you never tripped
Cause that was then, and baby this is now
When you got my word, I won't let you down
I promised I love you with all that I got
You can have everything and I won't take it back
Cause I'm in it too deep, and I can't go a week
Without seeing your face and feeling your embrace
This shit is real, shit is real
I'll say it again, cause this shit is real
And I don't care how these niggas feel
Cause you understand what they never will
And that's me
Cause faithful dudes, they don't come around
So when he come home, better take him down
Imma freak on his body, Imma cook and clean his laundry
Imma treat my man so fucking good
He slowed me down when I moved fast
He's not like other guys, he's just so ...
He noticed me, he cool with me
When I thrilled him up, I was telling crystal things
