You say you hate when I jump to conclusions
I just hate when you act so clueless
Show me I can be definite
'Cause all I've ever seen is you leavin' from the club with a woman every time that you go out and step in it
I'm really regrettin' this
Meetin' you lettin' you fuck up my pattern 'Cause now that you matter I gotta deal with the good and bad
I gotta deal with the thoughts of you and them in bed
Soft spot for the boy I got it
He the best thing and the worst thing
If I'm the one you really love then why would you ever hurt me
Sit in my room, sit in my room and I assume shit
Love hurts and I'm guessin' I just bruise quick
Sleep on it in the bed alone then I call 'em 'cause I need 'em and I love 'em even when he wrong
What if I leave and I never find nobody else
Don't wanna start from the top and do this over again
I want the nigga that I found back in twenty-o-ten (2010)
Cause I know what we had but it's nothing like what we have now
Man you're not the person that I knew
But I'm tryin' cus it's you
I'm lyin' to myself cus I do
Wanna make it work when it won't
Say you'll change but ya don't
Happens every time
You feed me the same lies
Tell me I can't go 'cause it's
