I'm all about the Benjamins like I left my lotto ticket at the boatyard
Bitch and I smoke hard don't give a fuck about these niggas show no heart
If I want some bread or some head he gone motherfucking go like a go cart
Cause bitch I'mma beast
Shorty talking shit shortly after she deceased
I believe in peace, but my nigga got a piece if we feel disrespected we gon' make that bitch scream
Cause bitch I'm queen
Niggas sleeping they ain't got no dreams
I don't sleep if I ain't got no green
And if I'm fucking with them then they is the money team
CAUSE MONEY RULE THIS BITCH
All my bitches mean and I'm the rudest bitch
I don't fuck with fiends or clueless bitch
Finesse a nigga out his life bitch I do this shit
Next level shit
And if a motherfucker tweak I'mma curse 'em
Return your boyfriend if his ass worrisome
All these niggas sick and I ain't gon' be the one to nurse 'em
Cause bitch I'm all about a meat roll
Can't crush on you if you fucking weak hoes
Dumb-bagging ass niggas I delete those
Got that bag use his ass like a cheat code that ain't shit but the Queen code
Twenty-four seven I'm in queen mode
'Lotta bitches hating won't link though
Look the devil in his eyes and won't blink hoe
