Bad bitches got a nigga up to no good
I was on the label, damn I should know good
Good with numbers, a dime know what to do with a nine
Like I just bought a rollie spendin' quality time
We go through the bullshit but you keepin' it tight
Yo I'm on that healthy shit so I'm eatin' you right
Even when there's friction, you feelin' the sparks
Girl you the shit, that's why I gotta pamper
You know and like The Roots, I gotta get my bands up
