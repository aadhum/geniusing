It was all struggle growin up
Always was the kid
Nobody ever gave a fuck, homie
Always doing shit all on my own
No parties nothin more than
Late nights with my bro
And my homies callin me
Like where ya at
Yeah I read the messages
But never sent one back
Now I'm at the parties
No way home
Least I'm with my dukes
Never spend a night alone
Started from the bottom
We still here
Started from the bottom
And we still fucking standing here
Started from the bottom
We still here
Started from the bottom
And I'm still fucking standing here
Heating up the game
Cuz you know I've been a blaze
Thinking back to when I started
Back back up in the days
Ya ain't see the picture I drew
Its on display
My vision won't happen over night
You gotta wait
That's just how it goes
Write my own ish
Never singing ghost
Killa call me Blizz
Crowd of people mobbin' me
And women takin pictures
Dad wanna see me bank
Paper cut fingers
But I don't really have
That type of patience
To convince him
I'm a good kid
Never had problem drinking
Always fly straight
My turn signal never blinking
My team's been working hard
Ready for the new season
Fvck those haters homie
We don't need them
We still youngins
So we kick out feet back
These other dudes always complaining
Never change the topic on the same ish
Fvck those haters homie
We don't need them
We still youngins
So we kick out feet back
These other dudes always complaining
We're going for the fame
Til we straight up Bill Gatin'
