Bad bitch
Got her own money and a crib, now that's a bad bitch
Mean mugging in the Ghost, they yellin' Beetlejuice
My niggas with me got more stripes than an Adidas suit
I took a break
They want me to give my seat up like I'm Angela Bassett
Probably catch me in the closet like I'm coming out
Hope bitches just as good on foot the way they run they mouth
Your man outside and what he drive was the only challenge
First date, hundred a plate
I bet these bitches gon' respect me like a pimp with a cane
I'm a savage
Feelin' like I'm Kobe
Got her own money and a crib, now that's a bad bitch
Your favorite bitch on Instagram don't look like that in real life
And your favorite rapper should be acting cause she don't even write
Second time getting top from the same nigga
Got her own and a crib, now that's a bad bitch
