Sometimes a glass can press clean the stressed
Tonight we drink to my success
Love is a drug and you know I'm on it
Told her to hide it before I OD on it
And really I think I know who I'm becoming
The realest out my city and this kid is always stunting
I've got to keep it going cuz theres just no other option
