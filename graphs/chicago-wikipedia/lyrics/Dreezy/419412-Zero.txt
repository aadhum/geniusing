I think I know why these bitches mad
Cause I’m steady counting these zeros
But I swear to God I don’t see you hoes
Cause I’m steady counting these zeros
She probably look like a model but for a dollar bet she bop-bop-bop like Kemo
Aye I’m the illest girl in the league say I’m so sick I’ma need Chemo
And ya boy keep touching on me
I’ma have to get a free throw
Bet I ball on a bitch all net like I’m tryna catch Nemo
And girl I know you go to bed mad at me like you playing out Ne-yo
My niggas cracking cards cause it’s stack or starve
Then it’s adios like the Migos
Keep talking put that bag on him
