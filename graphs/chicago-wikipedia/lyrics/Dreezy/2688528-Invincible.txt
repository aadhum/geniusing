You can't break what's in pieces
They tried their hardest to get rid of me
I'm still breathing for a reason
Prolly cause it's my season
And all my downfalls got overshadowed by my achievements
I knew that I was different but nobody ever saw the vision
All the clubs I couldn't get in
All the lists I wasn't mentioned
Imma show the critics who they underestimated
Take over city by city then might start real-estated
I'm black and educated, but I'm over dedicated
You can imitate it, but no bitch you cannot replicate it
That's why we separated. That's why you love to hate it
Even at practice I act as if it's the game day
I surround myself with niggas that think the same way
Now champagne for the pain, join the campaign
I was made for this
They try to break me down but it down matter what they say
Just so you know, I'm so invincible
You could put me in a jungle but I come out with a mink
I've been living out my dreams I almost thought that I was sleep
Now I bet all these bitches stay in line like they tracing
Get Benjamins for a payment
My words is killing you ladies, lets take 'em back to the basics
You fake relationships' for a paid placement
They wait to get on tracks with me like I'm a train station
Don't need security around me
