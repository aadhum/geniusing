That's the perfect echo
sweeter than swishes
With just a whiff of her fragrance
She have you stuck like a picture
She helps the pain heel faster
Mary just want my money
She don't like me for me
But I love that bitch
She help me zone out on the haters
And I love that shit..
I'm bringing heat
Like my lighter
I swear I love that bit..
Extendo so me and you can
Last very long
She fuck around and let the hood hit
But at least she getting money
I love weed, I love loud, I love mary jane
But shit when I be high I love everything
But still I just treat her like a ho
Cos I just passed it
If she ain't with me on eid
Its like I'm fasting
So I guess I'm stuck with her
Until I'm in the casket
I told her if ima pay for you
You gotta stay for this
You baddest girl around no homo
Let's take a trip outa the town
And don't smoke
Ill sit and drown
You baddest girl around no homo
