I get decent off his yayo
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I run the game, you just a runner-up
I got a boy but want another one
You might just have to get that cover up
Keep my bitch with me, that's how I'm rockin'
Dropped out of college but I'm still a topic
He bank with Chase, so I'm gon' run his pockets
I get decent off his yayo
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I pull up, cut up
These bitches know that they can't fuck with us
Got choppers and uppercuts
How you want it? Bitch, sum it up
Bitches mad cause I got the upper hand
I'm in upperclass, don't want to fuck your man
Nigga's dusty
I'm in the Chi lookin' for Durk, tell him I got on my buffies
I got my own bag, I don't need your money
I don't need shit from you, I'm livin' so lovely
I get decent off his yayo
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
I get decent off his yayo
If I see anybody talkin' shit, I'm swingin'
