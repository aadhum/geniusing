Hit up Harolds on 87th
For a 5 piece and some mild sauce
Bitches silly
Coming in my city
When they knowing really
They ain't fucking with me
I'm feeling like a semi
Got it hidden with me
I be rolling sticky
That thing thick as Nicki
Got yo nigga with me
Left him with a hickey
He wanna hit
But he ain't even get a quickey
I be switching niggas when I'm feeling picky
The only rat I'm fucking with is Micky
I was really born in Chiraq
I done chopped it up with some real niggas and the next day they got whacked
I don;t have manners and don't make no apologies
Out of this world, I'm a star like astrology
Double life; Hannah
Tell yo nigga band up
And when he brake it, maybe he can talk to me
All of my ex niggas steady stalking me
I'm flexing like I got the Hulk in me
Money calling me
STOP comparing me to the weak
Writing this will probably take a week
Pretty face make a nigga chase
I'm the modern day black Marilyn
Niggas out here saving hoes
They need a "S" on they chest like a Sheriff man
If you ever book me
I be filling rooms, Le Baratin
Labels pricing me
Its so much ice on me
When I arrive they start carroling
I'm the reason y'all got rank
I'm just waiting on the thanks
Serena; I be throwing racks
Tell them to suck a dick from the back
Make a rap bitch commit suicide
Now i need to get to Weezy
As soon as you step a foot in Chiraq, you will feel uneasy
I wouldn't turn on them like a runway
Tell the bitch to get her checks up
No really though
I'm verified, tell that bitch to get her checks up
Got a hood nigga selling actavis
Got a geek nigga like Dexter
Tell them both I'm in love then I'm leaving off with they check stubs
I ain't giving pity, until I'm worth a milli
Niggas say they proud just to get a penny
I know hood niggas selling packages
If I wanted to
I could whack a bitch
Dreaming more than Martin Luther King
But in my city
I'm the queen
Timbs on
I'll stomp a ho
Then leave her there with a shoe print
Fuck wrong with these rap bitches?
You could never be the blueprint
I'm here to take my title back
Cause I can't take hoes serious
I said it once
I will say it twice
I'm the top bitch and thats period
