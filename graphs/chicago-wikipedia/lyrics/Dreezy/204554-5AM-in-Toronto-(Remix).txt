You could never estimate me
You never woulda thought
That im a legend in the makin
Hot verses every record
Feeling heat like some Jamaican
Blizzie boy be the killa
I'm diggin your grave in
You could never match
The pinnacles I've been placing
Underground rappers
Locked up in the basement
Crib the studio
Homie that's where I make hits
IFlowing
Somebody gotta go tape this
King labeled in gold
I'm going all in
I never bluff
I got these others rappers foldin
Sittin at the winner circle
Got my team in it
Haters want fame
They wanna be in it
Dreezy from lean
Always burning green
So plz mothafvcka get to steppin
If you ain't winnin
I stunt for two niggas
That's stunt double
Criminals takin shots
You don't want trouble
Drivers round here tryna hit and run
Spittin all these whack bars
And they say its just for fun
Hater niggas
Course you would talk of me
Id kill all yall niggas
If I dissed ya properly
Got dudes in my the circle talkin shit
Its turnin to a square
You mothafvckas don't fit
Guess they really do need me
They wanna stick around
And then say they knew dreezy, but
I don't fvck with them niggas
I got a true squad
Real niggas in it cuz you niggas is not
Got k's on
My first major collaboration
That's up for all to see
You can't say I faked it
