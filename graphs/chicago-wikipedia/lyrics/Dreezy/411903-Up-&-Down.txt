Why you givin' up on us, like you don't know all the shit we been through?
Everything use to be right, now you be actin brand new
Thought I was your friend too
If we in it, it's gonna' take two
I be yellin' until I go blue, but I never would give up on you
And fuck everybody that's hatin', degrading they always got something to say
The wanna' see us apart, that's why they smile in your face
Tatted your name on my heart, that way it never would fade
Even when loving get hard, you somebody I never would trade
You're somebody I'll never forget, cause' with you all my feelings legit
These oth-er couples ain't on shit, No one else in my heart is gon' fit
I want you to be there when I'm rich
And I know that I act like a Bitch
But, you should just make me yo' miss
If we fall, we just taking a risk
Don't tell me that you love me if you don't(you don't)
I just wanna' be by your side
So, maybe we should drop our pride
Let's keep it one hunnid'
We breakin' up and keep makin' up, it won't stop(Won't stop)
But, I'll never leave, cause' I know that you are my rock
I ain't giving up, cause that ain't how I rock(how I rock)
We go up and down, we go up and down
Why you be getting mad at me, like being committed is easy to do?
Niggas be all on my heels
but they ain't got nothing on you
These bitches be lovin' the crew, but I never be frontin' on you
Kept it real, and the feelings is true
Im attached like im laying in glue
You say that you love me, so if that is true, we gon' have to make it official
You be blowin' me like I'm a whistle
But, I better come first like initials
Cause' I been your girl from the start
Even would bitches would tear us apart
Took me a chance and I put down my guards, now you the only nigga' with my heart
And I could put that on my soul
I can see me with you, when I'm old
If I wanna escape, would you roll?
If I was falling apart, would you hold?
I'm done overthinking, will it really last I a never know
But, he see through me like a microscope, and  here for em
Just to let him know, that I feel em'
