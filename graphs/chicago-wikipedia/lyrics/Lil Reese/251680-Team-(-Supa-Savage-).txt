Who got that drink, I need that drink (that drink)
Who got that smoke, I need that stink (that stink)
Oh that's your bitch? That girl fucking the team (the team)
Oh that's your girl? That bitch fucking the team (the whole team) (X2)
Who got that drink, who got that drink?
That shit that you stir up and it turn pink
Catch a opp in traffic we gone do our thing
Catch me off in traffic bitch I got that nen, that dean
Hit a nigga with the macs, we don't really give a fuck
Ride around with 30's, them my favorite things
Better make it count, don't shoot if you ain't got aim
My niggas on your ass and best believe they got aim
OTF and 300 that's what I claim
GBE and 300 that's what I claim, you a lame
We don't play no games, we only aim for the brain
