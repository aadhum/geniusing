I said I'm always rocking the latest
Cock it back and spray it
Extort shit and you better pay it
We don't count money we weight it, boy
Cock it back and spray it
A hundred grand for my belt
Put a hundred grand on his head
Bet a hundred grand he gon' tell, boy
Cock it back and spray it
You can't owe me shit, you better pay it
I got bands all in my hair
Bands all in my pocket
I got it low for them pigeons
Don't keep bricks where I stay
No nigga, I'm not stupid
I don't love that bitch
I was never shot by cupid
Benjamin's is my best friend
I been stacking them
Killers on a payroll
The D.A. was mad
Should of seen her face, when I beat trial
