[Intro]
Steady ride with my niggas, I be slidin' with my niggas
It's war time, first in line with my niggas, on the line with my niggas
I be slidin' with my niggas, steady ride with my niggas
Gang!
Steady ride with my niggas, I be slidin'  with my niggas
It's war time, first in line with my niggas, on the line with my niggas
I be slidin' with my niggas, steady ride with my niggas
Gang!
We gon' say shit when it's that time, my nigga
And you ain't really with it, actin' like you with it, that's the quickest way to get it
.45, cock back, bullets steady spitting
Caught the niggas snoozing
When niggas see cops, best believe they be speakin'
I guess I be tweakin'
