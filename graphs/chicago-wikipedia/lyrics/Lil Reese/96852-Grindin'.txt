Want it?
Come and take it from us nigga
Young niggas grinding
Killers stay behind me
Shit, ain't hard to find us, cause we always shining
Look at all these diamonds
Forgiato riding
Take a look up in my circle, new niggas can't find it
Pull up on your bitch so fast, just watch how fast she climb in
Whenever I'm out in traffic, that .30 be my sidekick
If we catch an opp in traffic, we gon' let him have it
Young living savage, all my niggas savage
Take a nigga down for whatever, just to have it
And I heard he got it
I be in the hood a lot
I ain't hard to find, bitch
I be on my grind, bitch
I be on my grind, bitch
I be toting 9 shit
That is hard to find, bitch
.
Smoking weed relaxing (*Inhales*)
Double G designer (What?)
Tempurpedic mattress, the nina sleep beside it
I'm busy stacking cabbage
You know what that mean
Got a lot of green
Wanna suck and fuck me, gotta knock the team (Yup)
Get a night of fame (Yup)
Later shorty, I forgot her name
Now I'm posted trying to knock a block of 'caine (I got it)
If you run up on me, then I'm popping things (Bow!)
It is not a game (Bow!), now you mopping brains (Bow!)
