And where I'm from that's 300
normal spelled backwards
Got some little niggas in the Chi-Town, they ain't 'bout to be talking
Nigga keep my name up out your mouth, that's all the fuck that I'm saying
I ain't never been no police, I ain't never did no cuffing
Nigga killing niggas in all your rhymes, ain't never did no busting
See my targets flipping like Gabby, they be doing gymnastics
2pac, Juice nigga, hit 'em up
Talking nonsense, feel the contents of a clip
forty calibers and nine millimeters equal subtraction
See the way Reese or Chief Keef make beef brief
