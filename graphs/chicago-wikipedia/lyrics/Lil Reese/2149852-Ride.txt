I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
Black Amigo mafia
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
If I get a real jug, get smoked
On my momma it ain't no joke
See I'm riding and smoking
All my niggas they toting, my niggas they blowing, but niggas they go in
If you a stank kick your door in
And I don't do no new friends
Can't trust a soul so won't shake everybody hand
Can't trust a soul so won't shake everybody hand
I'm going crazy but don't make me have to clap a fan
The nigga hating he a opp man I think he a fan
I never lost it but I'm back at it, I'm on yo ass
I never lost a year I'm back at it pick up yo head
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
I'm just riding and smoking, got everything in motion
Smoke, ride
Smoke, ride
I'm just riding and smoking, I'm tryna stay focused
