I done seen so much, I'm scarred for life
Me and my money gone ball for life
My nigga Credo got charged with life
Guns on my sides so I'm armed for life
And my young niggas still hittin' kick door
Every four bars needa' switch flows
You knew your fucking mans was a snitch though
So why the hell you took him for a lick for?
If the rap donâ€™t work, then we on the block tipping
And I'm still on that block I call six-four
Fuck the law, flee the scene, that's ugly
Get in my way then I'm getting on dummy
Sucker, get in my way then I'm getting on dummy
