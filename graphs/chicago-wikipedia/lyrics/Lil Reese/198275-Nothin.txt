I'm rolling shit
I'm toting shit
You run up on my niggas they be blasting
Lil niggas holding yeah they packing
And niggas they don't want nothin'
And this comma steady comin'
Don't run up on us bitch we blasting
That bitch she going cause I'm flexing
Them commas coming its not question
Of course we packing its no question
I'm bout that life man it's no asking
My niggas with me so don't ask me
Put money first that bitch come last in
I'm killing shit I need a casket
Them commas coming bitch I'm flexing
