What's up with all these fuck niggas
What's up with all these fuck niggas
They fake as fuck, man, I can't trust niggas
300, it's just us, nigga
Too many faces, I can't trust niggas
I'm getting money, I can't trust niggas
I grab my 30 if you a little bigger
He pillow-talking, that's for bitches, nigga
Your bitch want me, I pass her to my niggas
Ain't never seen you, so I ain't gone serve you, nigga
And we play for keeps so it's no worries with us
And we shooting this shit, this a true story, nigga
I'm Glory'd up, I'm in my glory, nigga
I'm big boss Fredo
Trap house full of crack, them pillow cases stuffed, nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, fuck with me, you get trunked, nigga
Step up in the club, bet none of us get touched, nigga
All us got 30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
All us got 30s, we let them bitches bust, nigga
Got a young nigga that's 15, and all he do is slump niggas
Young nigga that's 15 and all he do is slump niggas
Don't make me grab that pump, nigga, turn y'all to some skunk niggas
I'm toting, folk and 'em on pill, they rolling
Face shot, so ain't no viewing, closed casket, ain't no face
No face, it ain't no case, police, it ain't no trace
That's why I use the 8, sometimes I use the .30
That's when we do 'em dirty, that mean we show no mercy
That loud, that pipe be perfect, ain't a nigga perfect
Don't be no dummy, boy
A lot of niggas paranoid
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy
Free bro and 'em in the slammer, boy
