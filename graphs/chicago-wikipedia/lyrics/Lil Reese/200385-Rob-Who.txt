Eighteen
A small circle, no new niggas, I ain't switchin' gears
A body gettin' dropped every day, this shit real
A lotta niggas say they real, they ain't really real
A lotta bitches say they bad, they ain't really bad
Only The Family in my eyes, and nigga it's a drill
Niggas claim they in the streets, I'm out here for real
Can't trust too many bitches
I got the 40 in his mouth like I'm a dentist
