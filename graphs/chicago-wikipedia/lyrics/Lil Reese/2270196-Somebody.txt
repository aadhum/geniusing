I aim at a nigga 'cuz this
Rollie on me, I whipped it to a brick
No one, smoke a nigga if he trip
No hope for my city I was in
Free Law judge gave him more than ten
Hard body, can't none of my niggas bend
And we trend, all of my niggas is brothers, we don't do friends
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Where I'm from you nobody
So you kill somebody, yeah yeah
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Growing up, I ain't wanna be nobody
Had to get it on my own, I swear muthafucka that I don't need nobody
I aim at a nigga 'cuz this
Rollie on me, I whipped it to a brick
No one, smoke a nigga if he trip
No hope for my city I was in
Free Law judge gave him more than ten
Hard body, can't none of my niggas bend
And we trend, all of my niggas is brothers, we don't do friends
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Where I'm from you nobody
So you kill somebody, yeah yeah
shit I wanna be like Big Durk
Flat as hell, flat bitches with some flat car
I aim at a nigga 'cuz this
Rollie on me, I whipped it to a brick
No one, smoke a nigga if he trip
No hope for my city I was in
Free Law judge gave him more than ten
Hard body, can't none of my niggas bend
And we trend, all of my niggas is brothers, we don't do friends
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Everybody wanna be a somebody
Where I'm from you nobody
So you kill somebody, yeah yeah
