Young living savage
For that bread I gotta have it
The top I gotta have it
Young living savage
300, we so savage
GBE, we so savage
OTF, we so savage
I smoke kush, I'm an addict
My niggas know we got it
My bitches be attractive
Riding with that ratchet
Hunting for that cabbage
My young niggas clapping
Number 5, bitch they clapping
I be toting 30's
Me and my niggas thirsty
We out here, bitch we lurking
Cash out , bitch we splurging
I'm balling, Julius Erving
Fast lane, I'm swerving
If I got it, I'm gonna blow it
Bands on Bands, I blow it
I'm flexing, got her going
