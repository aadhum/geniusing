Raindrops do fall, I was in my bed
Used to pray that you'd call
Almost flooded pillows
But I came through the storm like Noah
But I'm the only beast on this arc
See I seek through my thoughts
Then you reached through my heart like Kano
Protagonist is played by a fox like Django
Medusa did me wrong
screenshoted love
Jermaine looked at me and told me it's a cole world
Wait wait what you mean, said she only 19
She done tried the whole team
How the hell you didn't know,wasn't even on the low
Boy that girl is a ho
Told me she was 26, can't believe this little bitch
Almost hit it raw too
Yeah they call me omen, yet i never foresaw you
Devil in her Yeezy's
Perils of an artist
Tryna find a good woman while you're reaching stardom
Gotta be the hardest
Wonder why I only want them for their undergarments
Heart is in December and for now I dream of August
