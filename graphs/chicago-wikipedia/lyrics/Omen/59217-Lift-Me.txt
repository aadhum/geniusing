Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me
Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me
How long do it take for a dream to come true when I swear
I'm just tossed as a crab in a bucket
But it ain't number six,
My excuse is gone, I could use one now
Please don't bring me up just to bring me down
Aye, aye, Is it stress or is it depression?
Cause it sure don't feel like a blessing
So I brought up the pen and I escape from the thoughts of my brain
Leave them tossed on the page with the strongest intention
so tired of this roller coaster
One minute I'm cool, next minute I'm close to tears
