Follow me down the yellow brick to the project steps and the ghetto
All of my friend are gone in the wind,
tossed in the pen,
lost, and they all live in sin
Robbing the kids slaughtered, offing their limbs, darkness is calling all of our kin
It touch 'em, then romance 'em
It bust 'em down and ask 'em if they like some private dancing
So many times I've tried to run away, but I can't outrun hell
It's here to stay, wish I had wings on my back to fly away
Had wings on my back to fly away
I just wanna fly away, far, so far
I just wanna fly away, far, so far
I just wanna fly, just wanna fly away
Just wanna fly away, just wanna fly away
I just wanna fly, just wanna fly away
Just wanna fly away, just wanna fly away
Everyday, striking her face, fighting away, screams in the night and the day
Ike-ing her face, go and get her knife and her mace
But she say he's so handsome, she love him
She romance him, she bust him down and ask him if he like some private dancing
So many times I've tried to run away, but I can't outrun hell
It's here to stay, wish I had wings on my back to fly away
Had wings on my back to fly away
