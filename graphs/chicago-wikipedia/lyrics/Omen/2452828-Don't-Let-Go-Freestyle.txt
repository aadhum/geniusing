I'm carrying burdens bout as heavy as caskets, bastards
By El Presagio
I ain't fucking thotty hoes, trying to get lotto off me
Dark meat is targeted awfully often
Auction off the caged bird, sings off keys
Took us out our chains made us slaves to the c-note
Rap cinematographer
Indica blunts is puff flipping off officers
All they stories be the same that's awfully odd
Read through your bull like I was Pau Gasol
Hearing songs of bullets plucking at heart strings
I can tell a vision that's way better than television
Hold up freeze the frame, Chiraq on my screen dawg please explain
Just exploited our name to increase your fame
Tell RZA that my clothes don't keep me safe
Soon as these niggas get money they all speak the same
Mama told me I'd be different from the others
Mama told me I'd be different from the others
Been gifted by the unknown like a grab bag
Rather be an asshole than a half ass
Trying to stop the flow better get your sandbags
Just came from court side seats at the Bull's game
Snow bunny, web camming for top dollars
She get around but fuck it man I brought condoms
Now we fucking, smoking, I'm playing "Backseat"
