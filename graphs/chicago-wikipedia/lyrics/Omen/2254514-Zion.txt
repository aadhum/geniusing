I'm just a block away from Zion
A block away from Zion
Scabs, scars and wounds
Know I'm just a man, but I stand far from tombs
Built like a pyramid, I'm damn far from ruined
My great hunger could turn my notebook to the 8th Wonder
Swear getting older's kinda scary
When all the women that I used to love now getting married
And the rest of these girls is just a drag like Tyler Perry
Your head's on my chest, body's on my brain
Everyday we be texting, play ghetto 20 questions
Be lying if I told you I wasn't thinking 'bout sexing
Maybe I should slow down, cause damn I'm catching feelings
I say I'm not gon' call you, change my mind in 5 minutes
A block away from Zion as I squeeze on her clouds
Rain drops cleanse my soul whenever I'm feeling down
I say nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
Nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
Nothin' make a man feel better than a Queen with a crown that be down for whatever
I say nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
Nothin' make a man feel better than a woman
goi in
She asked me "Is it love or lust?"
The same reason little boys be watching double dutch
I love your nose ring and the piercing right by your dimple
A block away from Zion as I squeeze on her clouds
Rain drops cleanse my soul whenever I'm feeling down
thatever
