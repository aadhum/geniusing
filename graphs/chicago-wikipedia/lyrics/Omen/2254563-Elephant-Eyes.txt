Empty parking lot, I'm in my car, I scroll throughout my phone
4 am, I'm horny, drunk, I wonder who's down to bone
Nobody replies and now I'm outside of your house all alone
Selfish thoughts, bad intentions, I tell myself I'm grown
If papparazi gave a damn about me
Man I swear this here is like the saddest photograph to ever reach the masses
Look at the stars, they're so galactic
But see this love I feel for you is bigger than what they've seen inside their telescopes, incredible
I know it's late but I had to see you
I'm suffering through this syndrome
Lovesick, these clubs mixed with gold diggers and birds
That only wanna be seen in VIP and show off their purse
You were different
You made me wanna be me, without the liquor
I need you back girl, you were good, don't need these bad girls
Remember you called me Elephant Eyes, I never forgot that nickname
Remembering all them times we had, I sit here and I wonder how shit changed
These days I'm always recollecting, telling the world about my stories
My crisis, my drama, all my love and all my glory
Through these elephant eyes
You're as good as it gets
I'll never forget
Through these elephant eyes
You're as good as it gets
And I'll never forget, yeah
I done heard this all before, but I'm no sunshine
Why are you doing this again? I'm not the one that confide
How dare you come to my house, you got some nerve to even be calling me
Telling me you still love me, when you're just in love with the thought of me
Is she right, is it true?
Am I really just stuck in a fantasy land of settling down, head in the clouds
Naive, I've let go of  gravity's hand
No way, that can't be right
I know what I feel, I know what's real
I can't let go, it took years to build
I laid my face in the steering wheel
And to my surprise, she opened the door and I started smiling
Took my keys out the ignition
Damn I've been out here for some hours
My phone was dead, the sun was rising
You cut your hair, I love the new look, kinda hypnotizing
Damn, I'm saying some corny shit, just out here improvising
But it seems she's letting down her guard, and this is a bit surprising
She grabbed my face and kissed me and asked me, "Come inside"
And before I could reply
She grabbed me, pulled me in and told me, "This is the last time"
You're as good as it gets
I'll never forget
Through these elephant eyes
You're as good as it gets
And I'll never forget, yeah
They say roses are red and violets are blue
We in a gray area, what color are you?
What color are you?
