Now see the flow too stunning, flow too cunning
Plus I drop gems (gyms) like low school funding
I'm a beast, I'm a boss, I will feast on your corpse
I ball in a way you couldn't teach on a court
I be ballin' on per diem, tell the truth man I be ballin' on per diem
What could you tell me? I'm in Switzerland
Got this bad Italian little mommy, so magnificent
Trust I'm out here getting it, but..
I'm on the low
I be out here on the low
Hey, it's my Henny flow
Nigga this my Henny flow
I be out here on the low
Jackets by Romanelli
Omen, money cannot bring you happiness, they been yelling
Struggle don't bring you happiness neither so please don't sell me
Something you just done heard and repeated, fake fortune telling
Not me, this be the realest shit I wrote times three
I be the illest, tell me Lord, why me?
Art galleries in my pen, don't know the pain that's locked inside of my grin
You better watch out for me
Nobody rock it (rocket) like me since Hakeem,
give me my ring
In my laboratory cooking up these horror stories
The things that y'all be calling swag I be calling corny
Look how I did it, here's what I mean
No kids yet, college degree
Traveled the world, astounding
Nobody in my city do it like me
On the low, I could be anywhere man you never know
You in the club I'm somewhere that you'll never go
You gotta grade your whole life on a curve now
TDK (they call me turn down king)
They call me TDK (they call me turn down king)
Cause I be cool, so mellow, stay chill, laid up
Say what you want bet
Your ho gon' let me fuck
