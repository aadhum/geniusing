Yeah things change, things change
Things change nigga
Pick up the pen, time to write my sins away
Right my wrongs and then life goes on
Bitches be calling, then mistakenly niggas be falling
I fuck them and I leave them,
forever picture me balling
With cash that I never had, I'm trying to stretch a million
Hoping it forever lasts, a fear of going broke
Cause most niggas I know can barely make the car note
Can barely keep the rent paid,
so I'm like Da Vinci
Painting pictures to last centuries since like the 10th grade
Carolina nigga with New York plates
My template, switch states and swerve, mixtapes was served
Get cake, absurd, and has big plates, preferred
You heard, my every word
Potentially could free us all, now that's a heavy burden
Sometimes I'd rather get some head and watch my wealth grow
Cause things change, am I the same one you fell for?
One side screaming "hell no" other side holding on for dear life
Lately nigga I feel like, I ain't that young frail nigga that I used to be
Pardon my ways girl, I'm still getting used to me
Cause things change, I'm still getting used to me
I ain't that old shy nigga that I used to be
Bitches watching niggas plotting on me, truthfully
Gotta be careful what you wish for, as you can see
Things change
Things change, it'll never be the same
I've never been the one to settle, it'll never be the same
(Yeah, things change)
Nothing ever stays the same, it'll never be the same
(Things change)
Nothing ever stays the same
My memory banks got some pain to withdraw
Don't use bandaids but, back in the days I was stressing a grip
The only black in my class wondering, where do I sit?
College campus too fast, now depression exists
Like I'm less than equipped, feeling destined to quit
Then you appeared, made me see myself without a mirror
I felll hard with such a frail heart
She taught me that Allah was just her way to spell God
And she was my American pie, so cultured
Her intelligence ahead of her time,
looked at my face
And with a smile called me Elephant Eyes, a secret nickname
Always seems to settle my mind, cause I guess it reminds me of you
Which reminds me of love, which reminds me of truth
Which is all the above
recently liquors in my body, it's all on my tongue
Give you my food for thought, it's more than a plate of soul food
If you wanna change, gotta escape your own rules
Things change nigga
Things change, it'll never be the same
I've never been the one to settle, it'll never be the same
(Yeah, things change)
Nothing ever stays the same, it'll never be the same
(Things change)
Nothing ever stays the same
(Things change baby)
Hey
