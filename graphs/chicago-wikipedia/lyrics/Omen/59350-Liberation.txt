It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us
We were all meant to shine, as children do
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others
The most intelligent intellectual never pseudo
My beats and my rhymes, my own dynamic duo
My destiny is to be fly, just call me caterpillar
Motivated by my team, told me dream, told me stop second-guessing
A blessing when your friends are your best competition
Man, my fans is the best psychics
Heard them say I'm way too quiet to achieve my plans
If they only knew the loudest is the weakest man
Name: Omen, but D-Money be the alias
Got a lot of new friends and they fake as hell
They behind me, but they tryna form a paper trail
Where's my Clair Huxtable?
Drug dealers tryna get white like Sammy Sosa
Never made the dean's list, but we young black genius
Can't control my flow, just call FEMA
