Don't let these haters infect me
If I let them do it then I know that it's deadly
Cause they only do it cause they love me so
They love me so
I looked away, I'm never finna die over a hater
Uh, yeah
then she gives Shannell the evil eye
As to imply that I am taken, pure hatred in her face blatant
Hate is in the streets
Hate is in the streets
Hate is in the streets
I see haters in the streets
Haters in the streets
