Stop comparing, but it's so hard
When it's all around me, and I still got no job
Best friend a doctor, other friend a lawyer
Other friend's famous, Oh my God
And they all younger, did they just have more hunger?
Is fate playing hide-and-seek, sometimes I wonder
Where the hell is that life? What's affecting my flight?
Where the hell is my wife? Or at least Mrs. Right
Or at least for the tonight, can I least take you home?
Cause I need to vent on something more than songs
I'm more than what's shown, more than what's known
Can't get respect from the bloggers, can't get respect from the labels
And my own city sleeping on me now, I'm really getting so unstable
Gotta step it up another notch, though I got my eyes on the clock
Never drank, but I swear right now, man I need a shot of the scotch
Need a little puff of the haze, just a little something to blaze
