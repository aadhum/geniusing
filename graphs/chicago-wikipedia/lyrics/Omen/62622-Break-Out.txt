I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga
Where I'm from, that shit'll get you murked out nigga
You screaming loud with that beef talk
Them niggas bring it to you, you gon' wanna peace talk
The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga
Better Break out
Young gifted and black a nigga stay on his grind, that money stay on my mind
That’s what I say all the time, a nigga swear on his mom
And I don’t pay y’all no mind; no I’m just lettin’ us speak
A lot of niggas I know will leave your head on your sneaks
I should be stepping with priests the way I’m blessing these streets
Now nigga bow to the king, playa, I’m out of your league
Carolina my heart, and now I’m making my mark
I’m headed straight to the stars, you niggas taped to the floor
Haters hate when I’m raw, they rather see me dissolve
Don’t wanna see me on TV; they rather see me shut off
They rather see me do bad, I’m asking, “nigga is you mad cause you trash? I flew past?”
Fucking loose ass niggas, News flash for y’all I’m too fast for y’all
Talking bad, niggas wouldn’t shoot basketballs
The flow will blow you away, now niggas know you a fake
You looking for money, come on nigga I’ll show you the way
I don't know what you heard 'bout nigga
Where I'm from, that shit'll get you murked out nigga
Screaming loud with that beef talk
Them niggas bring it to you, you gon' wanna peace talk
The streets talk and they saying you fake now
So when them boys pull up you better break out
You better break out, nigga
Better break out
You better break out nigga
Better Break out
Snucka you come with the cops, sucka you something we not, bluffing
come and your stock plummet
yo we flyer than top gunners
I leave the imprint on foreheads like Rick James
Comin’ from Chi-town where playas get shot down
Been reppin’ since day one, the Chi where I stay son
I’m from where the apes from, if you ever see them let us out of our cage, run
