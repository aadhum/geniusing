And nobody in that god damn waffle house had a clue about what just happened
Kinda crazy, but you were so comfortable
I told you what I do, how I'm chasing my dreams
But you the only line that I pick up for
She said "I got bad news, I got a man and I know you get chicks on tour"
Yeah, I know these rappers all the same, these rappers all the same
But you don't love him and I don't love them, so girl let's spark the flame
I'm only in town for a couple more days
I need to love you a couple more ways
Gin is what I'm drinking
Just grab my body upon the bathroom sink, and
Just break my body into a million pieces
Baby, baby, sweat me out
Know just what you're thinking
I've got a man, but it's yours just for the weekend
So sugar honey I like all that your'e doing
I text you on Monday, no reply
Text you on Tuesday, no reply
Now I'm thinking damn, why'd I fall for a girl
Knowing that she got a man, such a foolish guy
Emptied out my gun, I gotta reload
I guess God had to repo' my ego
I'm in town for a couple more days
I need to love you a couple more ways
