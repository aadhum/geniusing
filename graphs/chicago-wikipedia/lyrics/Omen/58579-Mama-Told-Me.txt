Mama told me I was special, thank God I listened
My environment never let me be a pretender
Similar interest with them dope boys but I was different
The hoop dreaming lonely child, hung around Hyde Park
Chatham
and the Stony Isle
Pimps, players, gang wars, living in a lonely town
Who can I relate to?
Feeling like the Golden child, Chi city culture
Full of pain, full of soul singers
Dead bodies in our rivers but their souls linger
A young black man living with unrealistic dreams
But luckily I’ve seen some unrealistic things
A child from the city took the good route
Always fit in and always stood out, complex
Layered, rather show you than say it
Though I know my greatness is always understated
Mama working 12 hours days on her feet
Coming home, cooking dinner, made her son wanna weep
My step father working while I’m zoning the beats
Meanwhile my biological was roaming the streets
Tryna be an entertainer, but my heart held love, no anger
He out there tryna be a singer
I guess this just the life I was made for
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)

Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Mama told me I was special
Gotta love her for that (yeah)
Yeah, truly yours, J. Cole
My mama coulda been a movie star
You know like Judy Garland
I went to St. Johns, I coulda went to Juliard
Cause my beautiful mind mixed with my musical bond
Deep as a funeral line, dawg, I get it from my mama
I used to be embarrassed getting picked up in that Honda
Thought my niggas might play me if they found out that my mama was a white lady
So like gravy, had to cover that
Plus my older brother black but he look white
In an all black school, picture what that look like
Looking back through the silence, he was screaming out for help
So yeah, I’m exercising
Right now my record climbing, I’m sort of a stair master
Niggas got there faster, I took the long route, I never been a scared rapper
Tell me, whats the marketing plan for realness?
What’s the demographic target audience for brilliance?
Who can A&R this passion and this dedication
We need some more Sanaa Lathan’s in our population
Music’s forever my lady unlike Jodeci
