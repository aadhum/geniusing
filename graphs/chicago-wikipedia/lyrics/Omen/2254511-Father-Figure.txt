Led us wrong man, I'm just being honest with ya
Look at us, we just a product of your malnutrition
We was born cause you didn't have a condom with ya
Mama's boy, mama's boy
Up in school wearing brown corduroys
Mama never asked you for the child support
Didn't show me drama and didn't hound the courts
She told me that your father did the same thing
Her love was strong enough for me to maintain
Or wait maybe so, cause when I was 8 years old
Mama got married, now my step daddy run the show, tension
Tension like the scene of a crime
"You ain't my father" was the thoughts on my mind
That was undeserved,
granny made me pancakes
While my uncle tryna make me go to church to worship my father
Looking back now, how ironic
See uncle Mark took me hooping, crossover dribble
Then he took me shooting,
Jordan's my hero
Another father figure who really ain't mine
Penny Hardaway, Iverson and Kobe Bryant
Listening to Snoop, listening to Dre
2pac, Biggie, Nasir, of course Jay
Listening to rappers who ain't grew up with their fathers
The same story for me and all of my partners
Don't go, don't go
Said don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Said don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I need you and you need me
So tell me what happened to our family tree
Oh now you wanna be a father figure
