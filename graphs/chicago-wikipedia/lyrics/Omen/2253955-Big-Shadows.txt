Remember Spliff Star? remember Memphis Bleek? remember all them side kicks that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
Remember Lil Cease? remember Murphy lee? no disrespect is meant but dawg that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
I was a youngin', late bloomer, never had recorded writing raps on my computer
When i was a shorty, uncle Mark he introducethe, legends of this game, to my ears
Never thought id be a rapper wanted to be Kobe, wasn't good enough for NBA, that hit me slowly
Meanwhile i was writing all on message boards, nerdy text battles, backpackers i would join
i started biting Canibus and using bigger words
Met a couple other kids they nice as hell damn,
thought that i was fly, they got me in a tail spin
One of them was named Therapist, thought i was arrogant cause i won competitions that he thought was unmerited
Got a little cooler, had a lot in common, way more than just rhyming, talking how we'd change the climate of this rap game
So i put out 'Do The Right Thing' and that shit ain't do a damn thing
He dropped the come up like a year later, both of us on this journey tryna be some entertainers
Months past then he told me them industry heads was talking
Tryna get more MySpace friends, hoping they'd log in, discover me
But who knew that jay would discover you?
swear when i heard, i felt that shit like its my "W"
Remember Spliff Star? remember Memphis Bleek? remember all them side kicks that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
Remember Lil Cease? remember Murphy lee? no disrespect is meant but dawg that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
Happiness lasted and now I'm living vicarious, that could happen for me, inspiration was my inheritance
I dropped a classic verse on this song called the badness then gave the internet madness on this song called enchanted
I was buzzing,touring i think i fell in love in London with a girl named Claire, but see this world ain't fair
Meanwhile i went from omen to his little homie, you know his protege or whatever they wannna call me
I started getting angry, like damn don't want no more help, my foolish pride, suicide, i put that gun on myself
Metaphorically cause the majority saw me as something that historically is not where i want to be when my story peaks
They call me AZ, i think I'm more like Nas, Lauryn hill but they often treat me like I'm Pras
I think i'm top 5 talent wise, i may not be on TV screens but the camera lies
Remember Spliff Star? remember Memphis Bleek? remember all them side kicks that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
Remember Lil Cease? remember Murphy lee? no disrespect is meant but dawg that ain't what's meant for me
Poor me, poor me, woe is me poetry, damn I'm drowning in my pity, think i need some chlorine, wake up!
Boy stop acting like a hoe, there ain't no captain save em
It's a million that would love to be in my position had to stop my bitching that's when i unlocked my vision
Elephant eyes
I been blessed, i had fans scream my name in a crowd all around the world so i had to change up my style
This is just a platform, up to me to transform, do i focus on the rose or just on the black thorns?
Remember Spliff Star? remember Memphis Bleek? remember all them side kicks that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
Remember Lil Cease? remember Murphy lee? no disrespect is meant but dawg that ain't what's meant for me
Big shadows, i think i need more sun, big shadows, big shadows
