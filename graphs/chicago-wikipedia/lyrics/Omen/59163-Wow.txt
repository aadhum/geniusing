Now they drooling when that limousine pull up
I never seemed cooler
Three piece Armani and Berlutis with the wing tips
I was that chubby nerd dreaming of the prom queen, wore them tight jeans, had me harder than the concrete
But then I saw the picture of a couple and their kids in the hall glass: "Prom Queen Family that died in a car crash"
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
I met a girl named Porscha, baby, she’s so gorgeous, the girl so scorching
Call her my black whorget, took her to my fortress, body like a horse, man
Telling me to tease her, she love it when she tortured
Get up in her ribs at my top speed, screaming out "Don’t stop please"
I ain’t called her
Told her from the forth for I’m a true player, -- already warned her, on to the next one
Family reunion, my sister brought all of her friends in, now I’m choosing
This is your auntie’s daughter. You all are first cousins
And her name is Porscha. Porscha? Porscha?! Wow
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
Ain't nothing promised, I promise that I could take you on a super fly trip
God, I'm up inside her like a sonogram
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow
Everytime I thought I had it all figured out, life seems to make me say wow, wow, wow, wow, wow
