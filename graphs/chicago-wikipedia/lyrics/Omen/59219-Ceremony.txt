The neighborhood ball player
Quiet, was shy around them girls
Who knew that he would fly around the world?
Fans coming to my shows want more money than I do
Thanking God, I made it this far
Came through the storm, but another one's awaiting
Under dog love from fans, hoping they ain't traitors
Turn around a year from now, well time is full of hatred
I've seen it happen before, so if I gotta face it, I'm ready
Family functions friends weddings are sacrificed
All just to write and recite some words from the mic
