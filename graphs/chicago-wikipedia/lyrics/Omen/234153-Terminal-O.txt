You entering my mind now, welcome to the compound
Look to your left, see the images of Chi-town
I know the weather getting chilly baby, calm down
See the mean mugs coming from a teen thug
Witness the mental of a soul left to fiend drugs
Look in the kids faces, they all got a song
Let it connect us even if we never got along
The block real rugged, cops steal from it
So many killed, they'll permanently feel hunted
Oh and they alert you, if somebody coughs or sneezes it'll merk you
You can call me a conspiracy theorist and say I'm creepy
Tell that to the air men that was up in Tuskegee
