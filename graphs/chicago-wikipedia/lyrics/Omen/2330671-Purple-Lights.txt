When the night time came I was plotting out flows
She's fireman, finna drop down poles
Shaq in his prime as I'm knocking down goals
Working three jobs, can a king manifest
Turn Down King took a turn down hill
Finna disappear, disappear like Field Mob
Know you heard 'bout me, Turn Down King
Always had dreams of me in a Wrangler
Or a Range Rove but I couldn't hit my lay ups
Word to Cozz, know the team way too strong
