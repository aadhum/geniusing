Feeling better than competing for a wager
Broadway bow, Grey blazer
Homie think that he a player but he couldn't get the ends if he paid her
Quit acting shy like summers
It's a live night, spend it with some live life hustlers
The whole team got bottles of bubbly
So what the fuck we look like with another case?
So go on player
On not successing at life, or looking mean at me where there's a bunch of divas. Yo go grab a girl and beat it iight?
Everlasting life
Life stole some friends, I am still in tears
But I found myself, rather than drown myself
Inside this Hennessy bottle that I can't down myself
So I send shots to my niggas like I'm missing them
Throw some dimes at 'em like a well that's what I'm wishing them
Had a homie who told me that the future don't mean shit to him
He said being in the present was such a gift to him
Praying that we make it home safe, we had no umpire
Labels put their offering like a reverend
Hit a home run and pass the plate like collections
Isn't it ironic you inhale every moment it feel like Heaven
Damn, look at that for a second
Ironic if you inhale every moment it feel like Heaven
Wow
Still at the post where I was posted as a kid/ posted up pouring poison for my boys who used to live/ they said im suppossed to be posted on posters im supposed to do it big/ so im sticking to the mission like a post it on a fridge/
In the club going ape with these women and broads
Curiosity killed the cat it ain't kill Curious George
