As I look out the window, will I see the sun shine?
As I look out the window, will I see the clouds in the sky?
And it's a damn shame you think that I don't see your campaign
Some of 'em mad cause I don't hang on the same corners
I got friends that can't wait to say I changed on 'em
Acting like a Nike sponsor, try to keep me in check
You can love me like your favorite, you can hate me like a Laker
Long as you know I am a genius, you should call me Amadeus
Mixed with some Ossie Davis, lyrically, I'm a savior
Man, I hated school, I picked my major, but that ain't make me no major moves
As I look out the window, will I see the sun shine?
As I look out the window, will I see the clouds in the sky?
All of my friends moved away, I'm left alone
Wondering who's here, my college years made me lose hair
Was planning to move to New York, but I was too scared
Lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for seven summers
Bloggers coming at me, acting like they know the way
Disrespect me, and say that I'm just my friend's protégé
Like I ain't been working for years on my own, writing rhymes
Doing songs making beats all at home by my lonesome
Window of opportunity was always draped and sheered
As I look out, will I see the sun shine?
As I look out my window, will I see the clouds in the sky?
