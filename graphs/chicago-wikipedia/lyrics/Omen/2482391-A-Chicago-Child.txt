I'm 19, gotta give me a nine
Cause I live among this city with crime
I mean the grittiest kind
On the block, gotta get on my grind
I stand on cop cars screaming the city is mine
See my mama in the living room on her knees praying
Guess he in the sky, shit God ain't here
Bless for me
please don't say that son
I don't want to lose you, you don't want to lose me
You don't need that gun
Mama please let my arm go
If I don't carry this I don't see tomorrow
Please save all that for another night
That church shit couldn't save my brother life
See I'm tired of the lows, so I'm getting high
What you trying to tell me, I should vote for who?
Is Obama gone bring my brother back?
