I move
For the love of the people
With a flow that'll kill the club like E2
No disrespect intended
Sweaters vintage, holla back
Blessed ridiculous
Checks with interest
Gotta stack
More dollas
Rhode scholar
4.0 flow
I got more soul than old timers
I been scheming since I was breathing
I been dreaming since I was semen
Been a fiend since I was teething
Started with the failure for dreams
I had with Spalding
Landed rock bottom
But still feel like I'm falling
It's never me but all my peers be balling
Why it seem like all of my enemies get applauded?
I'm better than the veterans
I'm better than you ever been
Don't even mention no rookies
No sweat I'm so ahead of them
Catch me in that Letterman
With Dopart lettering
Etch me as heaven sent
I Bogart settling
I take mine
I created my own lane
Through the grape vine
I'm creating my own change
I done lost everything in my life
Only thing left to do is to gain
Through the strife
Though the pain like a knife
I lost my hoop dreams
Thinking that I'm bi-polar
Filled with mood swings
I done lost my job
I done lost my squad
I done lost my girl
I done lost my world
All I got left is my art and my goals
And my heart somewhere lost in the dark
And it's cold
Raised in a set full of sharks in the Go
Where the sparks finna blow
And the narcs wanna roll
They sharpening blow
Now I'm hearing shots targeting O'
You wanna send shots?
Well I can be your basket case
Please don't awaken the beast
I've cast away
He'll smash your face
Mayne, I ain't never had a plan B
But you better get you a plan Z
You understand me?
A vigilante
I'm upping the ante
Mind like an antique
And all of this time
I was just delayed
Because I was afraid
Till the only thing flowing through my veins
Was the pain
Afraid of my failure
Afraid of success
But don't pray for me
Just pray for the rest
