For so many years, I've been struggling, fighting this battle
Poisons me, cloud my vision, can't keep my eyes on the sparrow
Mama been telling me since I was young that I was a pharaoh
I'm so passive aggressive
Waiting for perfect, perfect never came
Me and my enemy the same in the mirror
We all the same in the mirror
As I stare into this mirror, my eyes illuminated
Cause for the first time, I see who I was truly hating
[Omen]
Only I can stop my dreams
My only enemy is myself
I look to the sky and I scream
More than ever need God's help
Only I can stop my dreams
My only enemy is myself
I look to the sky and I scream
I was asking God for help
God said I had the power within myself
