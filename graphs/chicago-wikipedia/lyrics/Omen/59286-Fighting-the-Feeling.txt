Would you believe me if I told you that I've never cheated?
Probably not, but I swear to you, it's no misleading
Now how do I clear the mixed emotions?
Can't go to mama now, I think I need some different coaching
Oh wait, too late, see now she left me
That's probably cause I left her
And this is weird, though I never ever acted on my impulses
everything ain't always about your actions
Sometimes you can have an inappropriate attraction
