I got that shit all you niggas just love to ride to
Funk for your trunk is what I provide you
So slide through your hood with me in your deck
On top of all that, I'm so, so remarkable
Flow to make you motherfuckers know
Ain't an MC coming close to touch
Bitches I like to fuck, guns I like to bust, so...
Lay on back (listen to the B side), light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want
Lay on back (listen to the B side), light up the blunts
As we give you motherfuckers just what you want
I never knew, niggas never had a clue
On who was the king of the street
Four deep in the Range Rover jeep, guns under the seat
And my nigga just came home from work release
Cristal in my lap, chronic in the air

[Brat]
Nigga, pass that shit like you just don't care)
Yeah, you on my shit list, Biggie burns spliffs
When I'm pissed, release the Rolex from your wrist
Nigga, no human being, Korean or European
Be seein' what Big be seein', I leave 'em peein'
In they draws, because Biggie Smalls
Is far from weak -- Brat-tat-tat, please speak ...
The Notorious B-R-A-T)

[BIG]
The raw combination, the destination
Number one tote a gun with no hestiation
Live with the funkdafied cutie pie
Gat by the thigh, the Smalls by her side
If you fuck with her you got to fuck with me
And we'll be rapping at your motherfuckin' eulogy, so ...
Now baby Biggie, I done heard that Juicy
Didn't find nuthin but truth, in the hook
Be a pleasure to wreck with a notorious nigga ready to die
