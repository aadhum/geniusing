Open up, open up
And let the funk flow in
From this nigga name J and his new found friend
I'm hitting switches like Eric on the solo creep
For yo jeep it's the B.R.A.T
Putting the dip in your hip from right to left
It's the ghetto ass bitch and I'm So So Def
Nigga that's my click, nigga that's who I rolls with
And we kicks nothing but the fat shit
With the real shit, we got the shit you can't funk with
J.D.
So lay back and listen as I catch up on my pimping
And freak this duet just like Ashford and Simpson
Putting it down ain't no thang to me
And ain't too many hoes that can hang with me
Tear the roof off this mutha like Parliament
I'm on a roll In Control like Janet, dammit
S.O. S.O. D.E.F.
Humunah, humunah, comin' up at cha like Ralph K
And since this ain't no Honeymoon, I'm here to stay
There's a new Tag Team in town

[Jermaine Dupri]
Nigga, Whoomp, there it is
