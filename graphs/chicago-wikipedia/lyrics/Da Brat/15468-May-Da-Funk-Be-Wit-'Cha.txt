Now back from the 6-o-6-4-4 full of indo
Untypical is that bad ass ho
B to the R to the A to the T
Ain't no bitch is this industry that can see me
The city of C-H-I is where I'm from
The 3rd motherfucker to drop the bomb on the bomb
And here I come steady breakin bustas off
Up to bat is Da Brat and ain't a damn thing soft
About me
no doubt the B-R-A-T
Is all up in that ass for the motherfuckin ninety's
So funkdafied who can be this lady
Brat westside bustin like a 380
From the top of my head to the sole of my feet
Broke down smoked out locced out is she
That bitch that'll hit ya get ya
And when you bumpin up my shit may da funk be wit 'cha
[Hook! Jermaine Dupri, Da Brat]
Fall into the groove of the waxin
Let my music take you high-e-i
Lay back kick it and enjoy the ride
And move that body from side to side
A real fresh voice over top of low frequency
Is the chain like connection between you and me
Why? Cause I got that bump de de bump
And baby you got them humps in your trunk
So it's on (Shit)
Lay back nigga we fin to ride
I gotta get high I gotta get mine
Baptized all up in this funky shit
Fired up is that bitch that you just can't with
