I promise the funk the whole funk and nothin' but the funk
Yoooooohoo
Well yo, I ain't no joke never have never will be
Down your whole block you can feel me
All I do is keep fucking it up
The doper my shit the bigger my come up
Now tell me have you ever heard a female vocalist
Swift like this that kick shit like this?
I don't think so, I don't think you know
No hoe that can flow like I flow
