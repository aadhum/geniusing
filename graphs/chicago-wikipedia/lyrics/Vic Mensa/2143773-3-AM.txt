As I cried, every night
Tell me what’s it like, what’s a life
(To be running from your demons at night)
I just spazzed out, drunk and passed out
Fuckin’ last night, I was so high
Did you take your pills today?
I don’t know man fuck my shrink
That bitch just wanna get paid
I never meant to get God involved
Do you hear me on that loud shit
I’m drunk
If she old enough to ride with her
She old enough to get hit
Oh why these girls so young
And they're just having fun with anyone
Just came from Vegas, just turned 21
She want a ride, road rage
Pour the drink
Always say tell you turn the lights out, baby girl bend over
