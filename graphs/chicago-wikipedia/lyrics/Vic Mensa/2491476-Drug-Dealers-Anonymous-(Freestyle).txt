My suitcase is packed with Alexander McQueen shit
Yeah, I know that I'm a target
So I drew it on myself, let the industry be the marksman
If you look close, you'd see that every bullet missed my frame
Them 16 shots around me not enough to count the names
From Tamir Rice, to Mike, to Eric Garner, Freddie Gray
Oscar Grant, Eric Gray—what more can I say?
But black on black crime is only one side of the story
You got them bodies hanging from trees in our recent past
You forget that this the type of shit that they teach in class
When the Harriet Tubmans drop, I need 20 Gs
Free D'Ussé for every slave she ever freed
Turn up and down to the Underground Railroad
The bouncers let my people go like Moses told the Pharaoh
Uh, taste is on the Spotted Pig plate level
My London chick doin' A-levels need a stunt double
I stunt like Rupert Murdoch, got me feelin' like a daredevil
I heard they tried to ban the kid from the SoHo House
That's cool, 40/40, get my photo ops
They thought that rap was just for show
But this is no Empire shit
I'm no Hakeem, I came to dream
Keep the Houston Rockets, the Clippers taller than Yao Ming
Oh, you don't know my name better watch your damn words
You don't wanna end up with that Kevin Durant curse
I'm Game 7 Steph, EP nothin' but net
You want a physical, Martin Shkreli, write a check
I'm goin' Wu-Tang forever, my crew bang forever
SAVEMONEY with that Roc-A-Fella, my new gang forever
