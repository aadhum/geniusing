I wanted to see where you would go
So I left a light, all alone in the dark
I could see your reflection
I could see your reflection and I'm coming to get you
I wanted to be all that you know
Where you gonna go? When they're coming to get you
Where did you run? Another malcontent
Dream everyone lives inside a perfect world except me
Tell me how could that be?
I'm a slave to the rhythm of the beat, put the barrel to my body and they tell me move your feet
[Hook: Thundercat]
Run, run, run
Or face this gun, gun, gun
Run, run, run
Or face this gun, gun, gun
Nobody move
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt
You want a war, you're bound to get murked
And I will let you use me if you want it
You will have your movie, pick your star
I know you love it in the spotlight, don't you? Don't you?
I know you love it in the spotlight, don't you?
I know you love when you wake up and go to work
And remember that you forgot my name was on your shirt
I'm an E! True Woodlawn story
Going in a pair of Jordys
That boy gone in the air,
catch 'em
Them New York girls, they like my southside accent
Ask if I ain't been killing it a lot
Is the INNANET hot? Is the radio pop?
Plucking the feathers from the phoenix 'till it's stuck as a rock
Now I'm in between myself and a hard place
Heartbreak hotel, for me it never goes well
At the car chase when my car breaks and my carburetor explodes
And I flatline at the same time as my heart rate
