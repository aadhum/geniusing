I think I'm feeling just a bit vindictive
Niggas been sleep so long I wonder if they even remember who Vic is
Or ever knew, need my revenue, thats with interest
For every song I wrote that didn't go the distance
Could have ran a mile when niggas barely learned to crawl
But it seems as if niggas hate to return your calls
When you ain't balling or got a song or two in rotation
Fuck the radio, turn it off
How you doing I'm here to tell you you suck
Your last tape might have had one or two cuts but thats not enough
Do that sound hateful?
Is that cause i hate you?
Not at all dog just remember who made you yo
Father you niggas style like I birthed you and bathed you
Do you wanna see what on the hip?
I'll wait, and let you think about it for you slip
And fall into the pit, down deep at the bottom
I think I got em and no one ever heard about him again
His family forgot him I got him a present before I dipped
Flowers for your grave made the track and rapped on that shit
Had your chick and we ran amtrak on that bitch
Winter in the coop got a chicken of snow
Hitting my line cause i shine, let me get in her clothes
You looking round looking like you never did it b4
Tried dancing with the devil i wondered if he could tap
I think I'm sammy davis junior the lead rat in the pack
Pack of raws in my pocket i be smoking till my neck hurt
I'm the INNANET AKA the connector
Show me to the plug
Cause i be on them drugs
Some of my niggas in school some of my niggas thugs
Some of my niggas dead broke some of my niggas dead
Red dot on your head right in the middle of the club
She clucking she can't stop
Don't she know all she ever get bubblegum and some cock
Probably be me and confidants presto, kami de chukwu
But do you remember the day when the world around you changes or does it fade in with the rest of what little you know
Blowing up like jared after the subway
Michael Jordan jeans I never did it b4
