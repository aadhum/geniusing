Go tell em, I’m gon' tell what they don't tell 'em
We been under water since they threw us in the boat
Without the cops trynna Zimmerman us while the whole neighborhood watch
They chained us to the auction block but now we changin’ the locks
‘Cause even Bill O’Reilly daughter out here drinkin’ Ciroc
Now that’s what I call the 21st Century Fox
Where Megyn Kelly try to tell me Santa’s white
It's in town
Murder us right?
I just remember rap stars the new Bach
I see the future Martin Luther dreamt when he was a man
So take these chains or give me death
I see the future Martin Luther dreamt when he was a man
So take these chains or give me death
