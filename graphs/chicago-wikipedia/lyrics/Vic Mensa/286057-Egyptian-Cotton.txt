Put your lip to your nose, put some stank in it
Like you're sippin' on a cup full of paint thinne
Shout to O-Dog, I'm a straight menace
Boy I ain't playin', I'm in the game and it ain't a scrimmage
INNANET, ballin' on the net like table tennis
Comin' up fast like Sonic on Sega Genesis
Vic aren't you excited? It's like you live a dream
Gettin' paid to be on the pages of magazines
Zetus lapetus, I might just take it to the moon
Mushroom cloud in the room when I make a boom
Gold ring, two C's on the frames
Used to hustle out my locker,
now my locket turned to chains
Same hood,
same fake I.D.,
I'm the INNANET, where my dinner at?
You little boy, centipedes on the Similac
