You coming home with me and my bitch
I wanna see you strip
She wants you, you want her, now kiss
Lick her ass, ain’t that some shit
I’m the shit but no laxative
Two at a time I want double the trouble
I’m taking off with the humble to hubble
I put your eyes in the back of your head
I’ll put your legs on the roof, she told her friend I’m the truth
She wanna come, only two doors in the coupe, but I want two
I’m squeezing the ho in the trunk, you fine,
let’s go to the truck
TV’s and the mirror, we fucked in the tub
In the driveway, on the highway
Fucked in the booth in the back of the club
Dutty wining Jamaican girl
Get the camera let’s make a film
He's trash, Let’s take him out
Three’s a company, that's enough for me
If she fuck with me, she in love with me
I can’t say the same, Damon Wayans, that's major payne
Major payne, major payne, major payne
Major payne, major payne, major payne
Cinderella slippers
Dancin' like a stripper
This is how you want it
Major payne
You a nasty girl I see it in your eyes, they wanna fuck me
Ass, ass, ass
hammer time
can’t touch this, but touch me
How many licks to the center of a pussy pop?
But I got a bitch you gon’ get me in trouble
You cold, like sprung in the snow
windy city bitch
I eat the pussy then scrape my plate
Tiny waist on that china doll, oh baby I like it raw
Three’s a company
Damon Wayans, that's major payne
Major payne, major payne, major payne
Major payne, major payne, major payne
Cinderella slippers
Dancin' like a stripper
This is how you want it
Major payne
