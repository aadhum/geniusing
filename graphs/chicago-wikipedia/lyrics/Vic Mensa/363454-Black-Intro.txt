[Intro: Malcolm X]
And once we see that all these other sources to which weâ€™ve turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves
Once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern. Once you change your thought pattern, you change your attitude. Once you change your attitude, it changes your behavior pattern
This is a higher level of thought
Yeah, take it back to start
In 6th grade, when I was stealing
And never thinking of getting caught
Then I came up, got a little game up
Used to leave up out the playground and go flame up
Writing graffiti tryin' to get a nigga name up
I Rememberin when you hear a girl parents on the phone and you hang up
Man the first time I got arrested I was 13
Stealin blunts from the store blowin dirt green
Paint on my clothes, I couldn't keep a shirt clean
Never been a bench player, always on the first team
When I used to call shoes in the store, "kicks."
Ain't nobody see it like a youtube video with no hits
I spit crack, keep the fiends with a flow fix
Ya girl is bomb my nigga, she blow dicks
Grindin' in the same pair of jeans till the hole rips
Listening to Wiz, higher then a flight school
I keep a 4 point, and I'on even like school
I would rather make a classic
Than drop a fuckin single and sign
???
but I'm like bougie bitches
I be thinkin I'm fine
And ya'll don't the shit they be sayin' like goku
You be on that sucka shit cuffin
Her pop said he want his daughter back
And it contains all that it was and will be
And I am as I always and will be
Cause I am and always will be that nigga
I am that nigga. I am that nigga
I am that nigga
