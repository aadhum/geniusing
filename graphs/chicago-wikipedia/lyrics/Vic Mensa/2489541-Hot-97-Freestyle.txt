Jerk
Yeah, I know that I'm a target
So I drew it on myself
Let the industry be the marksmen
If you look close, you see that every bullet miss my frame
Them 16 shots around me not enough to count the names
D'USSÃ‰
Tasters on the Spotted Pig plate level
My London chick doing A-levels
I stunt like Rupert Murdoch got me feeling like a daredevil
40/40 kick it my photo ops
They thought this rap was just for show
But this is no Empire shit
I'm no Hakeem
Hakeem the Dream
Olajuwon, my team
Keep the Houston rockin'
The clip is taller than Yao Ming
You don't wanna end up with that
Kevin Durant curse
You want a physical
Martin Shkreli write a check
I'm going Wu-Tang forever
