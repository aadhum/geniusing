It's like my favorite beat
This like one of my favorite Nas songs ever
This shit bring me back to when I first started spitting
When I was 15 thinking a life that I was living
That was back before I had it when I didn't
Before I made a mixtape and all of my shit was written
And next I'm in Texas sipping Texas tea
You ain't got the chance to Memphis blink
They tried to play me, most of this rap shit is lies
I see 'em Shady, but now I'm on Shade 45
Keep the mic like Janet
What's next is the checks
If you worry about me you need to go and call your ex
Hop on the phone line, I got niggas Drake-ing
Most of them phonies, they be faking
The time I'm taking on my shit is not minuscule
Money I'm still storing, hoes they still whoring
Shout out to Joey Purp, you know that that's my brother, Vic
pockets ain't lookin' skinny
Like you getting smacked
What was that movie he was in it?
It was uh, Ludacris was
When Skinny Black threw his motherfucking tape in the tub
On some bullshit,
He said Trinidad James need to watch out for Maino
It's too easy to put them in check, so go to the next
I break 'em like pretzel sticks
But still I ain't got no strap on the waist unless it's Magnum's in my pocket
Came to be, I'm really like the king to be
More like a prince
More like a prince when she dripping
And I'm sipping on that purple rain
