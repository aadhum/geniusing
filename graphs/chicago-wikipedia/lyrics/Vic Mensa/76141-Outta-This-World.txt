City of Win Mixtape Volume 1
I can do the impossible nigga watch me
I'm so uncommon, they just common like Common Sense
I'm outta this world
Flyer than a motherfuckin' spaceship
I'm outta this world
Alright... alright yeah
I'm outta this world
Flyer than a, fly-flyer than a
I'm outta this world
5,4,3,2,1
Beam me beam me beam me beam me up Scotty
I ain't goin' no where but to the top
Dropped my first shit, don't think I've ever seen a hood as hot
Boy I'm some Rodney King riots shit I'm wreckin' shop
Swear I'm cold enough to freeze time I'll make the second stop
Press play
I spit that black magic women shit
Niggas pointin the same finger they scared to pull it with
Go. Sharpshooter for the 3 I got my weapon out
It's showtime I'm on my Steppenwolf when I be steppin out
Them girls watchin', they know it's bout to be a done deal
It's like I'm playin NBA live shit is unreal
Incredible vision on some 20/25 shit
It's 2010, but I be on that 2025 shit yea
