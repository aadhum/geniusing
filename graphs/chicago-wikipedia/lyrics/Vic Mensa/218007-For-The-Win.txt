Uh-um, today was a good day
When I say you bad, girl I mean that in a good way
The winner is: yours truly
I will be ready when they give the awards to me
Congratulations
Tell em that I'm on till the next one
Till I get a buzz like my phone when a text come
Yeah, this is on behalf of my team
And baby tell me that I don't be speaking and so it seem like I be thinking that I don't even know [?]
I'm in my own world, '94 Common shit
I am the two three
Ima do it right (yeah), on my spring break shit
Shout out to the girls I'm kicking it at the lake with
Red cup sipping,
burning L's by the pool house
Hyde Park
I'm swinging for the stands,
Blowing up, they say I'm the bomb on some hundreds shit
Give your girl a heat stroke, hotter than the summer get it
A Chicago McDonald's, I'm posted up in the front of it
Save Money nigga, get a Chase card
Double O,
I'm riding on the track like a race car
See the way I'm putting words together like I ain't got a space bar
A Chicagorilla from the jungle where the apes are
Boy, I said I'm coming out swingning, put your guards up
Time for these candy ass rappers to get they bars up
Red cup sipping, burning L's by the pool house
Fuck bitches, save money (x8)
Nigga
Fuck bitches save money
And if you don't know now you know nigga!
Ah! This is so fucking fun!
When I'm getting bread, put the hollow head to they head
Getting bread up in the Chi

We getting bread up in the Chi, what?
We getting bread up in the Chi (getting bread up in the Chi)

Getting bread up in the Chi
