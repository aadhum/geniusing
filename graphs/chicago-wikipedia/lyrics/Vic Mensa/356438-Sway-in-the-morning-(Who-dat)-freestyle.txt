It's hell in the kitchen
Burning hot, turning rocks to the Pyrex pot
hood to gentrifix
The illuminatis didn't invite me to their pizza parties
Dip my blunt in
My butter's worth double cup
Manic depressants steppin with the devil like
Holding hands in a square dance with Uncle Sam
Something know when they comin you better off running
Still keep it 100 ive been
Off the top like, Kenna climbing the summit
If you step to my crew it's obvious im next to be
Blew, blow up, show up and get destructed
