Fake nigga lie to a real nigga, that's just some shit that you don't do

I just ain't for sale, they try and put my soul on clearance

Fuck the world if they can't feel it, but they feelin' us I trust
Most of y'all done heard the news
Vic went rogue and signed to Hov
I ain't Tookie Williams though, I ain't come up out the blue
This for the folks in the morgue, niggas back home still hoping it close
Ugh 17 years old, I used to carry warm piss for my P.O
Now I'm savemoney and C-E-O, this beat so cold

I would say we out here wildin' but that be an understatement
I'm on vacation and it's in places I get paid in
Chitown
Savemoney we ain't never stop and we here day one to the last day
