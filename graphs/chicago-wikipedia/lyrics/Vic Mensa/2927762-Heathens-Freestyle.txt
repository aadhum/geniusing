It wasn't always this way, I can attest
To nights I carried lead case a nigga wanna test
We packing like a Lunchable,
My history is filled with a long list of regrets
Looking back at my past, doing this victory lap
Surprised I made it, young eyes grown jaded
They killed my brother dead, wonder why I'd be faded
Sometimes I feel guilty for being the boy who lived,                      I could've been the one with that knife inside my ribs
I guess God had bigger plans for the kid when I woke up still alive on that hospital bed
Non-stop flights, I need 21 pilots
21 thotties in the W lobby
Man trust, you can rock a Rollie or handcuffs
Either way the police gon' say pull your pants up
That's why I date while I hate them I got no love
I was set an ultimatum on the tour bus
It's very simple you can walk if you don't bust
Papi my brothers so you gotta fuck both us
Keep a SIG,
Until these niggas kill me I just wanna live life
Cop a palace in the city, buy a little ice
But y'all know me, I don't rock diamonds
Only the Roc diamonds, that's how I'm shining
Big broach homie, it was all about timing
So every roll call I make sure I'm signed in
Wait til they find that max Jay signed him
Could be an astrologist how my stars aligning
I fuck with Bad Boy like I'm Mario Winans
Puff know I got him if niggas shootin' I'm firin'
Please don't even speak to me about stylin'
I rock Gucci drawers, my nuts Italian
Pulling big racks out the Gosha wallet
Get him to the church he gon' need a deacon"
Running like DMC's Adidas
Demons, heaters loca, like la vida
Outta' this world, Zetus Lapetus
I don't want your girl, cut her off like a fetus
Abort this track 'till a beat ain't breathing, bitch!
