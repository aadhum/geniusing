Yo, SaveMoney baby, you know how it go
You know what it is man, I’m here with Charlie Sloth on BBC
My niggas buying Audis out the dealership
Skating in the Pumas I could hit a treflip
Just signed a shoe deal, ain’t even signed a deal or shit
Hov like “Vic, boy, you know, you know you killin’ shit”
I think I’m Blueprint 1 ‘cause I’m still the shit
Control your bitch she keep tryna order every appetizer on the menu, chill
Why you get it twisted from the pop practice
They don’t even know the thing about I been through
In a Lex at the in-and-out drive thru
And get on the mic, drink they 2Pac juice and then, poof
Tell me how quick they disappear
Tell me who still got the car title in they mama name
I go stupid, off the top like toupee
And shout out Lupe but, honestly if we was in the booth
I might have to go ape shit, bangle, animal uh
They can’t test me, they can’t delete me
Control, alt, defeat me, beat me up
How you gonna come up fucking with me
When you ain’t gotta quid in your pocket
She off a zan, off a zan
I thought I had a million on down my luck
How you gonna start me? I’m push to start please like artly
I’m sorry Drizzy Drake had to miss wireless
But I guess I had to go on fire, cause [?] ain’t even ready for that
but, damn shout out to my home girl Rita Ora
And Dally off the west, I catch a body
I'mma take that to the centipedes, someone take this down to the cemetery
