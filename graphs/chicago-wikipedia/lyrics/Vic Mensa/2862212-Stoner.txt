Out of control, I forgot to take my medicine
If I take this pill, that would be death of me
I am a disaster, I don't need a recipe
Tried to be sober, that didn't work for me
I don't know your name, please excuse my memory
Anti-social, get the fuck away from me
This is the life
Only live once, let's do it twice
Time to ignite
You get the gas I got the light
One, two, three too many drinks, I think I might forget
How to count to ten, I tend to turn two shots into a fifth
I rock leather like a punk
