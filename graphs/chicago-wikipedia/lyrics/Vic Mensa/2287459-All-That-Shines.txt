All that shines, Is not gold
(Came up quick)
Yeah that's how it happened
Started off slim
Gained a lil weight rapping
Now I'm with the big boys
I'm with Hov out in New York
Like I lived it twice
Give your own advice
Nigga that's good advice
And the street lights will take you there
Take flight like Mike
When I stop at the light
Not even flashing lights behind me
Can stop me on sight
We get love overseas
Niggas claim their bread heavy but they paperweight
Like you'd done got away with everything
Then they get you for your tail lights
My nigga I'm grinding
You remember how that made you feel?
We in here and here to stay for real
I know that this shit could come quick as it goes
Last night I saw so and so
She ain't even know me though
She broker than a bitch
But she don't vibe with broke niggas
Like Jean-Michel the SAMO, SAMO
Hoes love games:
Cubes, nintendos
Kinda hard when there ain't no peace in the streets
Unless you got a piece
Then I'm saying peace
Poppin' pills, not the ones the doctor gave me
