I'm caught in between a rock and a hard place
I wish that I could see the future
Where do you go when suit and tie doesn't even suit you
Moms keep callin me
Tell her what I'm doing it's finna require all of me
I'm under pressure like the bottom of the ocean
Sippin wine like communion
Could have been a nigga that you get your shoes shined by
Instead I'm with bitches that lame niggas get declined by
