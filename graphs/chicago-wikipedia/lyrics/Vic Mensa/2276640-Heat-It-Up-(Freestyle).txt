Bitch we got the city on lock, I got this shit sewed up
I'm like summer time in July, I'm 'bout to heat it on up
I swear I stopped hearin' these niggas trying to shit on us
I don't respond, I'm like Ciara to that shit, so what
Boy you are just the entertainer you remind us of Cedric
I'm with them knucklehead niggas and they don't like to listen
Let me talk my shit ,I'm on my own dick, no condom but it's a lifestyle
Ball hard, you a light foul, doin' this since lights out
Amnesia to my old bitches, ooh like I don't know niggas
Papers please, no swishers
far as legal fees I need four digits
Always got a judge comin' for a nigga cause I'm livin' like a hooligan
And my hood so gentrified, niggas keep the white movin' in
Like yikes, put 'em on ice
17-5 for a walk through, bitch I might double my price
Shout out to Young Chop and all them niggas from around my way
I'm been coming for niggas heads, i's a newfound phase
Behind closed doors niggas do not war with the kid
Truly, don't do me, I over do me, no Nudies
How they accuse me plagiarizin' shit that no one has heard?
I guess that's just excuse for you to put my name in y'all words
I can't relate to y'all, y'all soundin' like a whole lot of talk
I fuck around and run up on you on a new IO Hawk
we do beef like Five Guys
TIDAL gang I'm HIFI, shout to Emory and Tyty
I'm ROC Nation like woah Nelly, Sha money and my woe Lenny
Molly wop, nigga no Fetty
Soldier Boy with the gold tell me
Flexin' on her from the balcony, we what's up, my nigga, we what's up
Know these niggas got it out for me, shit I would to if I was you
Ain't you heard I'm jackin' beats? 2015 Ice Cube
Bonjour to the fuck niggas on Complex tryna hike views
Show out to Newark, fuck with your boy
Fuck 12 like triple fou
In a Bimmer, used to whip a Ford
Hah! Got him
