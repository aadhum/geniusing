Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let 'em take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put your lighters up for me I'm blazin'
My teacher told me I ain't ever gon' make it wasn’t handed out shit had to take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin
Don’t give a fuck about critics they can suck on my di-dick tell 'em I'm breakin' they rules
Doing this shit on my own so I guess now that I'm crown I got the duty to kill it
I got you, you my brother forever where you are put your faith in me I'm shining
You can wish upon a star promise I won't let you down promise I'm gon' put it down
Promise I'm gonna rep my city everytime I'm outta town
I know a lot of niggas hate especially when I'm not around
But when I see 'em in they face I know they ain't gon make a sound
There's only two things you can be: That’s dead, or dumb and with a gun
There's niggas dying every day it’s the Chi Town home of the gun shots
Where niggas try to look like Al Capone in they mug shots
City where the weather gets warm and the blood drops
Some one tell me when it ends lost my mind I lost my friends
All that I can think to rap about is candy-coated Benz diamonds shinin' in my chain
Seein ghosts when I fall asleep
Is you really safe up in your crib or is you one away the strike will hit you any day
Minutes movin' slow I pray I make it through the month of May
When they took my nigga wish woulda seen him fore he died
We ain't no bitches but when we heard that shit you know we cried
Ain't that shit crazy, how just one moment can change me from my life
Had or dreams if I was dead wonder what that shit be like
Wonder if they talk about me then forget that I exist
For the kids that I'mma bring into this world, this is my apology
father
Swear you niggas can't stand side by side with me
Savemoney standin, no toppin me, nigga
Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let em take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin
My teacher told me I ain't ever gon make it, wasn’t handed out shit, had to take it
