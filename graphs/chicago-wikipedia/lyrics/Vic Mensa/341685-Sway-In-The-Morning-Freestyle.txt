Trying to flex and get embarassed like a baboon
Birds I don't feed no seeds till I be posted on the porch like a raccoon
you carried and buried under wood
To walk like I walk you need your best shoes
But sorry I don't walk no more, call me JetBlue
After the band, before the bands I never really went solo
I always kept a cup of niggas with me
Taking shots, better hit your mark
Three come for you, it might get sticky
Like a drunk Santa dropping his Henny down the chimney
Smoking Christmas trees, Happy New Year
Knew I was the future before the present
They questioning if I should move out of the city
Really ain't much left to do here, but I'm still here
If you on a wheelchair then come pop a wheelie
Traffic, traffic looking through my taxes
Been traveling so much I got out of state rates
Overseas plates shift the parentheses, different brackets
I'm Freddy fire starter you're more like bury the hatchet
Shush your mouth, you don't wanna smoke
You hide behind the mirror, scared to look yourself in the eye
I know you fear me, it's apparent
Like a mother of five trying to feed her family
Your food on the table [?] the chef [?]
My Compton niggas is rocking Dickies
I know my wave coming
I dropped the coffee, but I caught it, quick action
I mean I'm Philosoraptor with it
In the morning with Sway, in the morning with Sway
I'm with Vic,
Pac Divsion is my crew
Niggas no answers like Sway in the math class
