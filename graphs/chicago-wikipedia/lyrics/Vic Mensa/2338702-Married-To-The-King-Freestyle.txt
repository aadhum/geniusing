Who gives a fuck about what anybody say about me
Man y'all ain't raise me, word to Betsy McGurk-Mensah
She the only one, the only one I can't let down
Mama, she the reason, she the reason I ain't quit yet
I wake up at 9 o'clock this morning, 3 o'clock for tequila shots
So sick, blame it on the alcohol, Jamie Foxx
Ready to let it all go
I only wonder, will my niggas see tomorrow?
Cause we been livin' like the past can't catch us
And we been livin' like them niggas can't catch us
And we been runnin' in the streets like it's recess
I call this "Married To The King" and the beat Coretta
Down to hit a stain like a 197
With my dogs, I hope all dogs go to Heaven
If the lady is a tramp, let her suck the noodle
Shout to Denzel Curry, we don't take kindly to threats
I'm married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, death do us part
And I'm married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, man, she my baby
I told my new bitch I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I got rabies
I'm stayin' out the pound, they can't cage me
I gotta be the man I am, it ain't no point in tryna change me
I love it when they underestimate us
I can't lie, man that shit just make me want it more, want it more
