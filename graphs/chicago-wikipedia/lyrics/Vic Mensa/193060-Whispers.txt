To whom it may concern I roll another L and let the paper burn
Boy I'm bout to put on my signal I need to take a turn
See I be tryna tell em' but it's hard to make em learn
The white man run the ballers too, David Stern
Kindergarten teacher had me twisted
Had me up in that slow class
Didn't know that I was gifted
I bet they mad they missed it cause that youngin' bout to blow up
And they gon' want me down when they see a nigga throw up
Her feet up in the air man I got yo daughter toe up
The game chose me I didn't choose the game
I can only take away your perception of it I can't remove the pain
It's hard to accept the money and then refuse the fame
Now I feel like Etta James
Takin out my blues in vein
Go get a brain
Nigga lose the chain
Cause that's that goofy ass shit that be makin'
Most of you losers lame
A lotta dudes the same I know that I'm different
Kids These Days is like a movement in the making
Workin' on my touch like I'm on somebodies Wi-Fi
I'll tell you how yo back look
The mission is to change more lives than crack took
I know it's wrong but we all go through it
Fightin' my subliminal tellin' me dawg don't do it
God I'm only tryna' do what you would do
So why we split up for her like two and two
I know I been an underage drinker and a truant too
But when you comin' up in the city shit can influence you
I don't blame it
But they shoot it before they aim it
Drunk off murder sippin the red rums
The bullet wound from which a nigga bled run
For hours for the law even decide to show they face
That's the reason we get high is for escape
But when you runnin' from your problems man it's hard to win a race
middle passage
Lets be under the panther act and raise some cubs
Chi-town
I'm from the city that never sleeps
