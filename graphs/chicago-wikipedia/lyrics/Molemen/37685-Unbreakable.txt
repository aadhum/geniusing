Reciting verses loud as fuck, while still tagging shit up
Whose making passengers blush when he babbles and busts
Battling me you're either throwing the towel, or throwing the fight
I jump of the top of the rope
Rappers keep trying to be different instead of trying to be dope
choking artists who croak
All in your face, gems prices keeps them locked in a safe
I'm unbreakable, you can't make me or break me
And I don't give a fuck, none of you bitch niggas can take me
To telling kids how it is with a status report
Now a days commercial cats are all taking the game
You just acting for your boys you should all be ashamed
When on a low and all alone your looking awkward and plane
And leaving you guessing what's getting dropped first, your album or you
Here's a toast for you going platinum and silence is golden
