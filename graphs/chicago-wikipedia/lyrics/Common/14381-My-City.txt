This the city of Chicago
a hundred and eleventh
I'm not filthy
Nor am I rich
Not your wife is
See that your better halve
Do your math
And peep that two halves make a whole
Trying to lose my religion, like R E M
K town
wild hundreds
G.D.
And Stone run it
Hunted by police for display in state vile cages
Come out to make minimum wages
And with a desiese that are contagious
The amounts of Black and Brown they lock up
But the Most High encourages me to put the Glock up
And Stock up on do for self knowledge
A brother couldn't afford to go to collage
So I had to learn form the school of hard knock
On the hard blocks of the Chi
River Oaks
As my liver soaks
In mad
Hennesy
Niggas want a record deal
But can they deal with a record?
Cause once they get rich
They tend to switch
Like a sissy
Motherfuckers say Malik how you make your living?
I say by breathing oxygen
