Common, What's your twitter my brother?
(Yo @Common, check me out y'all, let's go)
Google+, all of that, this is what it is, it don't stop
[Common]
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was young 3 wise men came to visit us
One a hustler, one a king, one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle, and then start giving gifts
"You from Chicago - we want you to deliver this"
Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
I guess it's my addiction to women, ah!
Hennessey blending
Writing my own rhymes like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now I'm right here with the brother named Flex
He said we got them broads, yo yo they premium
Com Sense
with the album "The Dreamer, The Believer"
