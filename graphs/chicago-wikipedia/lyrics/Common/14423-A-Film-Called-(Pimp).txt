I'm a Person that's Making Profit
See I pimp internationally
I'm nationally recognized, locally accepted
I pimp with the truth, that's the only method
Seen her on Madison where Vice Lords be Travelin
And Chevy windows be rattlin
And badder than any other broads that I've seen in these parts
Her body language spoke like a smart remark, eyebrows arched
Thick lips, blond wig, nice tits, ass the size that I dig
Asked her the name, one way to approach her
See she had game, she needed me to coach her
Expose her to some paper, freedom and culture
The way a righteous pimp is supposed to
As he came closer in his eyes I seen fortune
I ain't having it like abortion
Walking with this stick holding his tip
Looked like a Black Panther that was trying to pimp
It was cold as shit, I'm waitin on my ride
Act like I didn't see him I tried
Motion denied
I felt the vibe like Roy Ayers
She was used to seeing pimps in furs and gators
Told her I'm an innovator, a gentlemen of leisure
That's in tuned with nature, hold Common's hand
I'm a take you to a pimps promise land
Where no man can break ya, break ya, break ya
Make your next move your best move, choose me
How I look working for a nigga in a kufi
If I was on a track you couldn't produce me
With them shits on your wrist looking goofy
I pimp without a pause, for the cause, I'm a rebel
You been on the streets I'm trying to take you to another level
Nigga you gone ho underground or ho mainstream
Nigga you must not know of me
I'm the mack here
Ought to have you ho for me
Pimp yo punk ass
Have you write me poetry
I'm from a lane called cash
You too slow for me
Birds in slick cars
Or have you on the corner trickin in strip bars
If you become mine the world would be ours
Respect the game, and universal laws
What, I oughta pimp slap your ass and make you fall against the wall
Why you in the game if you ain't even trying to ball
I know pimpin ain't easy
damn you barely surviving
We can't ride together cause you ain't driving
You and I together is like Ashford and Simpson
I oughta pierce your navel and put you on the track
Matter of fact I been looking for a ho that's abstract
Got stores called big pimpin (Common: Where)
Down South
In Texas I ran the best ho house
Choushi wa dou
(HA ha ha ha ha ha ha ha)
(Common: Why you laughin)
I'm laughin cause you funny
I'm make bitch niggas like you have my money
I get six hundred off yo' skinny ass weekly
You'll get all them righteous hoes in that dashiki
Yo, what ever happened to loyalty
Don't you want to become royalty
On the streets selling ass and oils for me
But you on this ho-asis and really I can't reach you
Fuckyou then I'm about to be a preacher
