Lord have mercy, mercy mercy me
You see I'm tryin to get the punani
So get your rattle rattle thunder clatter boom boom boom
Because I gotta gotta get some, el-bow, room
So I can Bang-kok, better yet, knock Italy
But raindrops keep fallin on my couch, try to sit with me
Tamperin up my program
so I play another slow jam
It's not an ancient Chinese secret
But you insist on stay and playin Genesis
I'm talkin the his and his and hers, Three's Company too
And don't come back now, hear?
The CB's, the CB's,
they'rrrrre here!
I'm checkin my mirror from the rear, blocks are closer than they appear
You say, "Fuck Nell Carter, c'mon Jimmy, give me a break"
And Petey mighta made a breakthrough
Try to tell her it's her fault, when Jack your Been wouldn't Stalk
It's fucked up, when Your Dick Is Playin Tricks On Ya
So you pop fizz, what a relief,
beef strokin'-off
My man, got your thing, in your hand, say, "I I think I can!"
Uh-oh you better get Maaco kid, cause old girl is salty
pick up your glove
What more could go wrong - you got the right one baby!
Uh-huh
let you tell it, everybody and their momma knows
That you came quick, quicker than a pizza, from Domino's
So I stopped dropped and rolled, so I wouldn't inhale a shell
to wash off the smell of cat
