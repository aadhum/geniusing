This is that automatic
I stay fresh like I'm wrapped in plastic
P goes spastic, C galactic
Southside boy, we Cadillac it
Charismatic, Asiatic
I hustle for mathematics
Cameras, action, changed the status
Actor tappin' yo' favorite actress
Gucci rockin', coochies poppin'
Movie watchin', booties droppin'
Body movin', showin', provin'
Stylin' and being fly (c'mon)
I touch the masses like a Catholic
Expensive rap shit,
my future's backlit
My vernac' attracts y'all react; so let's go, uhh
This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line
That universal mind control, now move yo' behind
Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name
Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same
It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang
Some pop, some lock, some move robotic
U.M.C. r-r-r-rock, don't stop it
Chicks exotic, mix Hpnotiq
Superhero role boy, I'm bionic
You a fad on some level, I'm a supersonic
Girl, you 'bout it, you can strip like comic
And trance to melodic Technotronic
Beats knockin', seats droppin'
Seeds poppin', streets rockin'
Freakin', shakin, money makin'
Stylin' and being fly
I'm the one the ladies-ladies chose to
Strip and pose to, take off their clothes to
This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line
That universal mind control, now move yo' behind
Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name
Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same
It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang
I am a renegade,
The future future of this age!
Twist the hay and the Grand Marnier
This is that new shit, keep 'em standing in line
That universal, mind control now move yo' behind
Uh, you know you like it; it's calling yo' name
Nigga, this is that new shit, and it don't feel the same
It's got that dang da-da-dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Dang diggy dang d-dang-a-dang dang
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang diggy diggy
Bop bop, d-dang d-dang dang
