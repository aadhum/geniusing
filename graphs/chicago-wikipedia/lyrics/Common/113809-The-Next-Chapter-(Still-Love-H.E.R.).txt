"I met this girl when I was ten years old"
With the mic check I paint a picture like Banksy
[Outro]
No I.D. is in the house
Twilight Tone he's in the house
J. Period is in the house
Kanye, he's in the house
G.O.O.D. Music, we in the house
J. Dilla, he's in the house
Yo, The Roots they in the house
Kristen Mills is in the house
"They say hip-hop is dead, I'm here to resurrect me"
"I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul"
