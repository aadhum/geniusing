brought forth
From a fifth of Hennesey
eighty-nine
Cats with clout at graduation got they name shouted
Go to Great America
me and my lady rock the same outfit
Round then Guy came out with, 'Piece of My Love'
Arguin over if he said, "Dumb bitch"
Everyday the same old with rainbow, watchin the sun twist
unfamiliar faces got marked a lot
Bismarck
Racquetball club
Against the wall me and my guys formed a colony
87th Street and Hyde Park was warrin
Over gossip, Kenwood broads was pourin
Suited in three-quarter Jordans, pro-models
And Starter coats
EPMD
I would quote,
Behind the beat, I took my first shot of Henny
It hit me in the chest like when them marks shot Benji
Fendi
down to the Taste
Nowadays niggas is fake, like that party at McCormick Place
I don't draw with em, cause they was born to trace
At times I contemplate movin to a warmer place
Then the Lake and skyline, give me a warm embrace
Moe
Twilight Tone
We'd eat, at Giordano's and break out
I.I.T
It's a Deja-Brew, when I see bottles of Gill
