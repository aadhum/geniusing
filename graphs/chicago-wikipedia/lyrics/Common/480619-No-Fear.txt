Sitting on stairs, in street affairs
Jordan Airs, he got at least seven pairs
Chicago Bear hat, quarterback the huddle
Call an audible of trouble came
His name Chris, black as his hustle name
Reaction to his chains, it's like a basketball game
A menace, he O-Dog, Caine
Wish a nigga would go against his grain
Used to staying but moved up in the game
The fortune of a caine, long live his reign
He do it for a son, he do it with a gun
Whatever he do, yo, he do it till it's done
The priest don't even want none
Something to be from the slum and be the one
Living life with no fear
Putting that truth in my baby girl's ear
Told her that dudes gon' want some ass
And whatever you do, do it with class
She wanna E, but to me, you gotta earn it
You can't circumvent life, you gotta earn it
They fire, drill, stop dropping roll
I popped out the cold hip-hop, that was gold
C'mon dog, you know my pedigree
Finding Forever, Be,
the sun never set on me
Many reign, but the game never weather me
If I'm in the building it mean I got equity
Where articles are black like Ebony
Since I was a shorty I was thinking longevity
