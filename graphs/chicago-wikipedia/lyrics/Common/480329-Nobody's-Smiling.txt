I’m from Chicago,
nobody’s smiling
Niggas wyling on Stoney Island
Where the chief and the president come from
Pop out, pop pills, pop guns
On the deck when the ops come
Pop some, ops run
This ain’t a game nigga, ain’t no options
Nigga selling on the block like an auction
Where the money and the bitches is where the guys is
I do it for Hadiya and Trayvon Martin
In the Chi ain’t a damn thing funny
Thinking of ways to get money
If we ain’t eating together what is this cake for?
Ain’t nobody giving it, that’s what we take for
Niggas is broke, what I need to brake for
Let the chains glow heavy, we paid for 'em twice
Tripping like you from out of town
The four pound will leave you on the ground without a sound
Ain’t no fathers round, sons of anarchy
Fighting attempts, trafficking, and grand larceny
At the party with the thots with the extra body
I’m in the inner city, it’s an out of body experience
Face on T-shirts with no hashtags
Just big ass trash bags tagged hash
been trill
Five versus six, Star Wars
No stickers, real bullet holes in car doors
Out of ten people that was shot, 7 ate 9’s
Two trey 8’s, and one 45
Tryna get to 23, numbers game
Are these celebrities way too shy to be loyal to the town
I take my publishing check and spread my royalties around
Popes, bishops, disciples, stones
Counts, princes, lords, queens and kings
They drilling on my land but ain’t no oil to be found
I might be part of the problem
I guess they just tryna prove they can back that shit up
Most of them can’t even moonwalk
G.O.O.D. music in the building, yeah we got ghost writers
They just actually ghosts
