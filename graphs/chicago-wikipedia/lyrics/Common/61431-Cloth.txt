We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you, I admit I had issues
Like ebony, your essence,
your pedigree, your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us, that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust, let's shake off the dust
From the cloth
[Hook]
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
Strong seeds I can see with you
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it, that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
The cloth
Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights, tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
It's the cloth
