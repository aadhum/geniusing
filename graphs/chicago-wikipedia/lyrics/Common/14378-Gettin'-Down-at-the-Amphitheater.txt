switch like Jekyll and Hyde
Illegal ain't illegal if it's less than an ounce
Keep it come in T. La Rock amounts, see +It's Yours+
Rap Delight
Persona in between the El Rook'n, and El DeBarge
Wisdom like a tooth,
Plug like Posdnuos
Just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
And just dance, you know you gots the feelin
Just dance, ah come on and get down
"Just get on down.."
one-double-oh percent
