A nigga told me only rhyme for 19-year-olds
Nigga, you should rhyme wherever the spirit goes
Here it goes, lyrical miracles
In theory, though, low end scenario
And sound boy burial drove me to classic material
For ethereal heights, I write like Richard
Invisible man,
the hieroglyphicable
Prolifical flow, on the walls where the mystics of Kemet would go
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddlin' though
This is a ritual for those depicted as low
The reincarnation of It Takes A Nation Of Millions To Hold
Us Back, coldest raps
For me the globe is like a culdesac
find forever
There's gotta be a better way, people dying every day
Wonder what would heaven say
The devils need to get away
I kneel where the rebels prayed
Seen 50 grey, but they need better shades
Niggas rhymin' like their whole style in retrograde
The escapade I'm on is like when the sun, moon and stars was born
It's hard to explain how these pyramids formed
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn
I arrived on the planet, never took the Southside for granted
Smoke a little, keep a high standard
The Roots are my niggas so got a fly band with
Son of the sit-ins, you know who I stand with
Dude said I was a hero, I ain't nothing but a sandwich
On some Marshawn Lynch, let me run it back
Every rap's a miracle, condition now critical
Can't lack lyrical, we need black generals
Holy war, tap into you like Savion
But I'm a orator, the corduroy boy
I walk like an Egyptian
I've been commissioned to deprison the prism of your mind
Spit the wisdom of the one devine
Close encounter of the wonder kind, front a line
Alabama Shakes on
Child of a fresher God
Influenced by the life of the former, Joanne Chesimard
Assata Shakur
The light-skinned spook who got in the door
I got in here for the same thing Cassius Clay uses pottery for
I'm on a world tour with Muhammad the prophet, my man
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll be burning, burning hot
Talent that I got will riz-ock the spot
MCs I'll burn, I'll burn, and I will burn, burn, burn
