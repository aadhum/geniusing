My raps do laps around tracks
and adapt
To any environment.. I'm the comma comma chameleon
I use to pop a wheelie on my blue and gray stingray, it had mags
That was when bitches had Gucci bags
And wasn't rockin' Starters, looking harder than niggas
Hoes wore clothes, that exposed they figures
8-7 stepped in the jam
You wouldn't know how deep we was, we all didn't sit together
Eat up all your vittles
And then step to the next cue
That was when mad was tall and phat was cold
The days of Old Chicago
and Fun Town
As shorties we run 'round, play strike outs till sun down
and the city's all run down
We'd troop down to Jew Town, talk a cat down on some gear
Have enough for a Polish and car fare
I stare, at what use to be better
And think about who use to cop our liquor
(Niggas be rollin)
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I
(Niggas be rollin)
Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um
(Niggas be rollin)
brew
(Niggas be rollin)
I got more rhymes than The Manor got folks
Had style since I went to McDowell
wearin' boats
And penny loafers though I had the nickel in mines
We use to hoop in my yard but now I dribble the rhyme
Put your body in motion only the strong survive
6 or the 5
Live is how the sets used to be, at the Racquet
Ball Club with music by,
Andre Hatchett
Or either a beat by Pharris at them country club parties
Sauers I would go there, hip-hop clubs were so rare
I liked the music anyways and it was always hoes there
Whitney Young and Kenwood was said to have the best chicks
But mostly Hyde Park and V hoes is who I messed with
the loop
but still go to division
Bust a spoolie on the spread, but still have some on your shirt
(Niggas be rollin)
Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I
(Niggas be rollin)
Gotta make a stop, take a leak and get some tops, cause um
(Niggas be rollin)
brew

I tuned into BMX, and taped Farley on the tonemaster
Took the 6 instead of the 28 to get home faster
Then HPK was the only station that would fuck with rap
You was on The Shore by yourself cats'd (would) say "Up your hat."
What you could you'd make of it, if you was a gump they'd take your shit
Either fight or break for it, we'd go to the lake and get full
Boone's
Red Bull
I remember swimming in Avalon, and peeing in the pool
"Members Only"
bald fade
Walgreens
Sportin' Waves pomade
would stalk, rush, and bang fags
Go to Marshall's and change tags, I snagged 'nuff niggas
In games of Off the Wall
"Piggy one"
Home of the original gangbangers, and ain't nobody shy

Ain't nowhere to go, so I hook up with a ho while I
