From the hood
[Verse 1: Common]
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake,
her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home,
early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low,
money by her Bible
The type of bitch that big said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform

From the hood
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
But I'm still single,
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
Jumping out a Bentley
some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
