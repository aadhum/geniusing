Same story, same target, different time
Trying to fight time, it's a battle of the mind
Waiting for redemption, surviving in a bind
Yo, talk about paying the ultimate price
Hurricane been incarcerated all of his life
Started out at like twelve
Trapped in a belly of hell
Grew into a man inside of a cell
Yo, anger just swell up
At a early age that develop
Hot head and now it ain't shit y'all could tell him
They said he's on a road to become a felon
But instead he swung blows that'll spilt your melon
He did his thing and was the king of the ring, undisputed
Started making noise but they tried to mute it
They put him through it
For him to make the system look stupid, [yo]
They rather look you in the face and shoot it
And leave your spot looted [or what]
Flashback to images of that night, out in Patterson
They pulled him over heading home from a gathering
Forever, imagine your locked down forever
Could y'all stand the weather?
imagine if your life was like a hurricane, a hurricane
Could ya'll stand the weather?
You built for that weather?
You gotta fight for what you believe in
Nobody knows the troubles seen
This flick left me wondering
'What can become of kings and young kids?'
Summer dream deferred, incident occured, freedom blurred
A freedom that would only be retrieved again in words, later on
The cops, y'all know what they be on
A nigga's life is like a field that they play upon, away and gone from
A young soul named Lesra brought him back to life
It's amazing to a man what a book could do
And how certain books seem to look for you
This is the story of a champion's fall and rise
The story left me wiping my eyes
I am time
You can't recover me, conceal or smuggle me
Retreat or run from me
Many have wasted me but now they are facing me
In the ring no opponent escaped unscathed
They had my man Carter locked in a cage, like an animal
