Y'all cats know the abstract nigga with a attitude
I'm grinding until I get blue balls
Don't make me act like where I come from cause it's brutal
Hustlers in Volks
I'm the only cat in hip hop that can go to a thrift shop
Bring that get up to the ghetto and get props
If you gon' get that kick-a-box make sure that bitch knock
Hip Hop is changing, y'all want me to stay the same?
Ayo, I'm bound to wreck your lady as I turn your lady out
I rock Rockports, you rock Timberlands
A thug came to me, said it changed his life
Said the love of his life, he used to bang to The Light
King Kong ain't got shit on me
I'm vegan but I still gotta get that cheese
