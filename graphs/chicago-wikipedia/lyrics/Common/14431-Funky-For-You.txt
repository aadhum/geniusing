We gon', uh
Y-y-y-yo, yo yo yo yo, and then uh
Yo yo yo yo, we gonna
Yo yo yo yo
I could break it down like whatever ya ahh
On some K-R-S be here forever type unh
You-you-you-you know you shouldn't rhyme like unh
Let them pussy niggas get in your mind like unh
Baby boy you could do it take your time do it....
If you get the chance
a b-boy stance
The baby-sitter of styles - I've traveled miles with
Bitches and....I've traveled miles with.....
I've traveled miles with bitches and brew
Your platinum but real unh's don't feel you
You sampled real unh's and then filtered
I'm built to last
The Roots
SV
SV and the Roots be the family tree
Ra-I'll move a crowd
I bust through.. narrow gates..
You don't like how I'm livin... well fuck ohhh
Many angel's fell to the dust
