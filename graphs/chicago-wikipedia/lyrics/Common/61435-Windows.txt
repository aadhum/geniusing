[Hook: James Fauntleroy]
If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men, we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
I'm thinking like Lauryn, a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close, there grows a new one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok, sometimes from commitment, we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton,
[Verse 2: Common]
A lot of love inside, got to help guide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
A lot of girls without, they become needy
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
"I can't run it for ya, but God know's I'ma coach ya"
