Look like the type that be like "No hable ingl√©s"
She said you look like you rap, where's your bling'e?
And yours clothes is tight but you don't seem gay
I said naw, thats dude from NSYNC'e
She wasn't married, kept her ring on her pinky
She said "You know I dont be datin' rappers"
I said I got my SAG card, baby I'm an actor
And she ain't into hoopers, she was there to kick it
Said "I'm married to this rap shit, looking for a mistress"
Flavor and Delicious
Time revolve
we fell in love as crazy as Nas
What happen to me happens to lots of men
Get deep in love and then your needing some oxygen
As far as wives I was thinking like Solomon
