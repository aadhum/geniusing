What do you see when you look at me and I'm just standing there?
Shit that make a robot twerk, that’s what's in my blood
And I won’t stop until I drop, cause my life's just burning out
So I'll keep climbing and won’t look down until I reach the top
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
What a world, what a world, what a world, what a world
[Verse 1]
A little boy from Chicago had dreams to be a star
And make a way and get some pay and drive a fancy car
Though his mama used to say to him, “Aye boy just go school”
But whether it was old or new, in school he broke the rules
Now his whole life he told his boys, “Hey y'all I'm going to rap”
So when he got a rap contract, it wasn't no turning back
And all the trash that the peoples say, he was using that for fuel
And the story goes on and on, it goes on and on and on
They say, “Hey boy, you rap real good, but you ain't making no hit songs”
