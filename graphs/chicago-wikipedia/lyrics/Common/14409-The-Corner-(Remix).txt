ghetto bastards
To act you lie scriptures
[Hook: Kanye West]
I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living, huh?
[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
We overstated, we underrated, we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them
[Hook]
[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our magic, our music, our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people
Black power
Black is beautiful
every city
bail bonds
[Hook]
[Spoken Word: The Last Poets]
The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar, our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal, our monument
Our testimonial to freedom, to peace, and to love
Down on the corner
