It's the Thelonious, super microphonist
Mini-Me's trying to clone us
Uhh, no time to sleep cuz if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat, just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
They know me so they restructure and reroute
All the way to London to my nigga Common house, right
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game, I assemble dope
Plus you, rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know, nann nigga
You better goin to God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body
Like if a 12 gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want it, need to find your ass a hobby
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude, more juice than Sunkist
You want this, see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime, Off The Wall with mines
Ball all the time, now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Connant Gardens
they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball, they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball, the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
When you roll a 500 that's really a 320
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play, don't let it be a holiday
Show you the definition of a payback
