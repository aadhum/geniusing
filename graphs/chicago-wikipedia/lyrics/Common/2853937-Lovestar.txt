You're my lovestar
What we gonna do, baby?
I'm the sun god, let me warm you
Out of my sides the Lord formed you
We could major in communication
Love can be sick or medicinal
God body language I be spittin' while we fuckin'
In your ear with somethin' that ain't clear
On your inside it appear, so somehow you hear
I'm sayin' I wanna stay inside
They say I'm a deep nigga, I'ma go way inside
Of everything you are
I ain't the type to be all up on your social
I'm in your face vocal the way a man supposed to
When we need a break
We take it
Cut from the same cloth, let's wear it
Our offspring will be you, me, and He combined
