I'm (easy!) easy, easy like Sunday morning
I can kick a stupid nervous joint when I'm yawning
Ahhh, Common's comin' with that old "oh excuse me"
Elizabeth, this is a big one, I mean a doozie
Doogie, Howser,
cause see, I'm like Bowser
Kickin it with the sha-na-na-na, the t-shirt
And the trousers,
Family Ties
Big Mac,
filet-o-fish, quarter pounder, french fries
Icy Coke, milkshake, sundaes and apple pies
I'm like an Indian giver, yo, give me that back!
play the Trifecta
[Now what's your name] Common
Come in again... Common
[How would you do it] Common
[Now how was she] Common, check it out!
Common is coming soon to a theater near you
To the UAC crew,
I'm trippin-and-dippin-and-slippin with the rhyme like Sliiiii-mer!
(Who ya gonna call?) Ghostbuster
I'm Petey Wheatstraw,
So I checked myself, before self got buck
Wild, tried to live how I had to fluctuate
To a state, and matriculate, yo I had to elevate
Off 87, the South side of Chicago
UAC
phat
sorta like Oprah before she lost weight
I put my rhymes in good hands, hey like All State
And I'm all in a state of ease, utopia
I'm the Spiderman, givin bug MC's arachnaphobia
The survey says, I gets more skins than Richard Dawson
But I won't catch mono or no type of disease
Cause when I flex, for sex,
(Yeah... In fact, it's feeling so good, let's take it all the way back to the '50s!
Sing it!)

[Verse 3]
A-wop-bop-a-loo-bop, a-lop-bam-boo
I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper
Two-steppin' through, yodel-le-hee-hoo!
Oui oui ma cherie, et comment allez vous?
(Contraire mon frere)
(Yeahhhh!)
alley oop to Coop
I gots the Magic, but I'm not a Laker
Ayatoll
Of Khomein
But the buck stops here
Take it EZ!
