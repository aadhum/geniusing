[Metro Scene Excerpt]
Woody:
We ain't got no home man......
Your grandmother can't take care of you......I'm all you got.
Cause I ain't got nobody either...people I thought I trusted...I can't trust...I don't know what they were doing ...man I'm just telling you I don't know.
I just need this money...I need it...I need this money...(softly) I need it.
