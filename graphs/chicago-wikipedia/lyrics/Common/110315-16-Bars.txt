Shout outs to No I.D
this is my sixteen bars
Feed live souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
On a rocky road with Dakota's live show
Lyrical gymnast, you set the bar low
It may be hard to read like hiero, glyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo
Check my youth revival, truth inside flow
I ‘stan’ like Em there with Dido
Crash party any live ho is liable to get banged like gangs that rival
The Ali MC, I fight for more than the title, ya idol
