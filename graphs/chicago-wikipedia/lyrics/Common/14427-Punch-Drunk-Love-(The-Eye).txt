'ey baby, am I crazy?
Or was you givin me the eye?
You said maybe? (Yea) Well, you crazy
Because I know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly
Already know I'm too fly (You hype!)
Already know I'm too fly
Check my dictionary, that ass is so divine
It slippery when it's wet girl, I can read the signs
I knock and I knock, uhh, can I come inside?
I knock and I knock, girl, can I come inside?
I feel like it's home when I'm in between ya thighs
You got the invite tonight and I'm so glad ya came
Girl I come from chica' so in I 'go
Turn around, it's about to be a TKO
You can call me daddy, I'mma put ya to bed
We exchange like students cause I study a broad
We take a ride down south cause you need to re-up
Girl you call me Big Bank like I was savin it up
I'm the doctor, I can hold it 'til patience is up
