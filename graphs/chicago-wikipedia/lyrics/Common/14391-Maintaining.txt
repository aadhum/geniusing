I was born in Chicago, raised on Planet Rock, talking zuh zuh zuh zuh
Cats knock my tape like boots,
I'm fresh as fruits
You pussy MC, it's you I rebuke
got me bent
I'm current as an event,
got on big hoes at Freaknik
Yo herb, with my hand I cock it, and rock it like that brother in Colors
Cause I want y'all to live, my crew is too live, we sneakin' to the rear
But I can't get us all in free (What?) It's just another case of that 2-dollar emcee
I rock the same clothes 3 days straight, to you they wrinkled but to me they
Straight
Now I'm straight are you straight? I'm straight as long as I got beer
There's a few good emcees, the wack I'm giving code red
Slim say I ain't nobody but when they see me at the party they be like
"Go 'head, go 'head"
Cause I got's the cuts like Bobby, rappers are dickheads
Choppin' they demo, I do 'em like Big Red
My office hours are from 9 to 5
While you avoid the party I make it live
I'm as dope as PCP, MC's see me and they start having flashbacks
I don't flash scratch, I gotta watch my back
Nowadays blacks don't know how to act
Besides Larry Fishburne, Charles Dutton and Wesley Snipes
Marks wanna test me because I test the mics
But I check 'em like sound,
and like Goose, I'm down
Plus I done got better since "Soul By the Pound", I maintain
UAC'll get the party live
And house more hoes than Spelman
Words I'm weldin' like James Johnson
My brains sponsorin' speech on the mic, I'm like a Jackson
Rappers I'm fondlin', they try to settle out of court
But I could never be bought
What type of rebel eats pork?
I'll take the cat and never get caught
U-AC together we fought
Cause I can't see my melons boxin' if we not boxin' with 'em
I don't care who started it, I'mma be a part of it
Regardless of the odds of how hard
It's been many times we was outnumbered and we still got with them
But a 5 becomes a 10 other brothers off some gin
I got juice, and this nigga scared
I'll F your head up, like the LA Four
When I flow like cash I go for broke like Melba Moore
Why should a male with a B.A. get more then me?
When Rashid got an MC degree
And a doctorate in rockin' shit, I go to Dock's to get
A fishwich with cheese,
