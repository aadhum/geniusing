Yeah the sun is shining brighter
Cause she make my day
Yeah, you really make my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
Yeah, I think I like her
Cause she really makes my day
Yeah, she really makes my day
Ahh-haah-ohh...Ohh-ohh-ohh
California dreamin' 'bout Californication
pretend like it's Friday and it is
Pretty painted nails, she took off her shoes
Sipping on some ale, I'm thinking, "Man, she cool!"
