Marks I erase like racism, I'm as large as a bigot
Brew is my escapism, when I'm bubbly I just kick it
What I need from you is understanding that I'm standing
On my own two, down with my own crew
Told cancer, I'm bad to the bone too, I'm prone to snap off
When I'm off that Cognac I can't hold back like a masseuse
I get loose like a screw turned from left right to tight
When it's time for some action I get Red's "Tonight's Da Night"
Dissect it I'm on hi-tech shit computers want to bite
Your style is Pascal, mine is Basic and just instinct
I'm went to F.A.M. and ran scams, me and Murray got up on big links
And if knowledge is the key, goddammit uh I'm the locksmith
At any rate, brothers gain interest cause I loaned them microphones
They couldn't house the shit so they had to rent to own
the Go rapper
When I'm alone in my room sometimes I stare at the wall
And in the back of my mind I hear a wack-ass rhyme
And I catch Alz-rhymers, then forget it, I get charged
Like a nigga in position with a stolen card of credit
Fuck flipping the script, the rap scene I'm trying to edit
My mellows call me "Never", they be like "Never's going to get it"
Never's too much, I'm much too, I do justice to poetics
That's why cats be like "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"
Like Kareem I got the hook up, brothers look out cause they look up
Rest in peace to Harold, I'm washing tons of rappers like Booker
T.
How you going to come off with the style that's sterile?
My foundation is a black block of niggas that rock they hat cock
Back I got my rap cocked get your Glock out the black face
Just cause you got Adidas with the fat laces and the fro don't make you
Hip-hop
You sorry excuse for funk rap
Why is there so many cranks trying to rhyme, yo funk that
The real shit's starting to come back
The Go is where I'm from and where I'm at, jack
I started eating cat when I was 10
Before then I was getting big dog like Glenn Robinson
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
But comes a time when you gotta come off of that booty
The facts of life I didn't learn from watching Tootie
But living in the big city but I still like Tootie cause she got big titties
My style is steep, I rip rhymes on the incline
Splat guts bust fat nuts and lay up like a crip line
I'm slamming, jamming on the one
I'm a bad man, you're just a good son
