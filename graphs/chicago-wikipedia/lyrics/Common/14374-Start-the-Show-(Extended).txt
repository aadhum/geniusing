Ladies and gentlemen the C-O-double M-O-N
Synonym for fresh, truth is the emblem
Cold as the winter when fake niggas was shiverin'
Shakin' in they Timberlands,
you as played as Bennigans
Hot for a minute, now you just a "remember him"
I been a master since P was No Limitin
Stick to sayin'
No gimmickin' and no mimickin'
Q infinitin' down old blocks are bendin in
Yellin' "Fuck tha police" like Ren and them
Pelican brief these niggas on who I be
Before the paper and the fame niggas knew Rashid
Noble like Drew Ali
Many have come
But few have been chose to be a true MC
You sing along with it, inside you knowin' it's wack
Young who? Oh, he the openin' act
It's a festival in hip-hop, we do it non-stop
Chicago niggas do it in staccato
Choppin' notes for my homies,
And Ferragamo shoes givin' dudes the model
With twelve monkeys on stage it's hard to see who's the gorilla
You was better as a drug dealer
Feel the passion of this B-boy rationale
Half of it is what you say and half is style
Masters now, verses touch the youth like a Catholic priest
Performances keep me stackin' the sheets
I know they wanna Resurrect but I ain’t pedalin' back
They gangster stories just as real as Kevin Federline rap
I guess it’s Kramer and Bush that don’t care about blacks
I’m standing supreme like the Dreamgirls
And I’m tellin you like Jennifer Hudson
Goin’ against me joe is self-destruction
Shuckin’ and jivin', gon’ do that dance nigga
30 with kids pull up ya pants nigga
