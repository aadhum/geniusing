I'm the river that flow through the hood
Through the woods, through the 'burbs
Through the mud, through the bricks
Over the curb, to the forest reserve
See a black man run, we need him to win
Young eyes search, search for a better tomorrow
I spoke like a child, I wrote like a child
Always smiled, let my mind float like a child
Wishing I was smart as these kids are now
All grown up still wishing I'm child, again
Omoye reminded me to stay playful
