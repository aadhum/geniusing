During divine hours, I use mind power to refine
Flower girls, and make 'em feel like black pearls
It's a lot you can find in the lost black girl
Pro-black like Craig Hodges with my dashikis in the cleaners
I kick it for the Chevy ridin' head to backstreet leaners
Check it, check it
I was born underwater with three dollars and a cocktail
Tryna make the Garden of Eden, out of Auckdale and Rockwell
Locked in this Grid like a 2Pac tale
A portrait of the Artist, formerly known as Sense
but it's the year
Of completion, I want a Queen to complete Rash'
Get off like Sam Jack' and it's time to kill
