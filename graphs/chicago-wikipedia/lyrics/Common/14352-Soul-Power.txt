Nigga breathe, I can tell by how you rap you don't believe
Ain't hungry no more, so off me you feed
Paint a picture of the ghetto like J.J
You're the Ray J of this rap world,
I travel the globe with a black girl
Named Becky, grand like Auto Theft 3
Style so developed, the law can't arrest me
You walk with blood on your shirt like Jesse
Jackson trying to test the reaction of the people
See through, trying to out act Don Cheadle
Bernie Mac
Picks with fist
Racing for paper these broads is starter pistols
I'd rather listen to silence then you holla
Borrowed your persona from the late that made Dear Mama
My realness is my armor that I wear up in this boy
your
I fall down and get up like Don McClurkin
Break it down like herb
The nympho of info I'm fucking what you heard
You ain't ready for war, you're stuck in the reserves
I mastered my high so I'm bucking at the birds
I been wanting to fly so now I do it with the words
For those in the fast-lane I show you how to merge
Get your own; you see, it's like home grown herb black economics
