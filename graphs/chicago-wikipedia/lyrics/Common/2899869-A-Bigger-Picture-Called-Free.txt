I knew inside when I was outside on the south side
Used to rock Jabos and go out with bros
Tryna get lots of hoes till I got exposed
To a bigger picture called free, in the picture, it was me
Al-Hajj Malik Shabazz, Muhammad, and Noble Drew Ali
A side of Erykah Badu and Andre 3000
If you hear this rhyme, it's coming from division 9
The toughest in Cook County
Illuminati illuminate me, fume and hate me
