I heard the sound of the trumpets, the voice on the throne
Seen the twenty-four elders and I knew I was home
I was told to write a song for the people
Take the original Hebrews on an Exodus of Black Excellence
Even though I authored it, let no one margin it
And make it all about paper or first week's sales
Though this is from Heaven give 'em verses from Hell
Those that fell off the path, bring 'em back to the math
Your staff will be your microphone
rise like Lazarus
They'll put disrespect on your name and respect it again
Every section you in, bless 'em and keep bussin'
If they don't like it, shake the dust and say "fuck em"
Until you get home, I'm the one you trust in
I'm happy to be in any place
Where God's name is remembered
[Hook: Bilal]
Go into the wilderness like Musa on a pilgrimage
The fake are the Pharisees and Sadducees
Give them that Garvey free from the Black Odyssey
Yo pardon me, you the God bodily
Functioning on earth as a part of me
Forget the New World Order, New Jerusalem is with us
Tell sisters they earths and goddesses
If they got bottom, don't get caught in a bottomless
Pit, there's a lot of us fit for the kingdom is near
You can tell by the wars and how the seasons appear
You'll appear in the circles in Hollywood
I birth you
In Chicago, you know how to parlay good
You'll get Oscars, Emmys, and Grammys, give those to your family
Don't get caught up in the vanity or the world's insanity
[Hook: Bilal]
They mean, in English, 'Peace, be unto you'
