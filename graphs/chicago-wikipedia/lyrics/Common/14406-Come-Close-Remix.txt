Fly Love, uh uh say what
[Verse 1: Common]
They say you got me dressing crazy
Eating veggies, wearing shirts extra medium
And if we break up, I'mma eat meat again?
I feel complete with you
Shit, I held up signs in the streets for you
In the streets people ask about me and you
I tell them "We go through what most people do"
Eh, I know you used to watch me
Rock Gucci and Versace
But now I'm back to my skater roots
I still got friends in them gator boots
Why? Cuz they drive in them fancy cars
Look, well I can ride you on my handle bars
On my BMX, baby
My testicles full of ecstasy
Fly love, uh uh say what
