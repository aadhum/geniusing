You niggas ain't real
I think you need to stop pretending
These niggas ain't ill
We know the deal
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
87 strip walker
I'm a shit talker
Fuck all night, yo, depending what Iâ€™m off of
Had a white girl I tossed her,
black girl I lost her
Break bread with the Stones I'm the rock of Gibraltar
Salt of the earth for what it's worth yo from birth
I was first with a verse
live niggas don't rehearse
Wear the prophets on the shirt, yeah, yeah that's the creed
I can give a fuck if it's real or a weave
I'm as important to the Chi as my nigga Mike Air
Jordan 3s on the feet
I been living in the moment lately
It's like the love and the hate seem to motivate me
Lady lady,
You been working out of this thing, if you're not tell me if you're really real
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
I'm the sole controller, opposite of sober
Flow from the south side to south Angola
And go all in and stretch it out like yoga
I'm flexing
oiled up like Texas
Survivor, soldier, a child is destined
A star is born in a Chicago storm
The name is Common, I'm anything but the norm, uh
I rhyme in a timeless capsule
I run the town, I'm a fucking juggernaut
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
Here today and the next you're gone
Cuz you niggas ain't real
