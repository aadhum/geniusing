This is the story of a boy named Lonnie Lynn
Chicago, discovered by du Sable
A Black Frenchman that I had to mention
There he stood, taller than most black boys
One of the best ballers out of Illinois
He talked about readin' the Quran and the Bible
Spiral of life, Chicago to Denver
Anywhere he went, of attention, he's the center
He did in a way, he made to the ABA
And the things he say on my record
When I was a shawty, he bought me "The Message"
It was his messages in the life I would step with
He'd walk around in them Air Jordans I gave him
I said, "Pops, them from Mike, man, you better save 'em"
The fight that he had with cancer was a brave one
Took Dr. Sebi's herbs instead of medication
Gene Ammons playing
So Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Somebody tell me where, oh where shall I go?
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know
If you withdraw yourself from me
Tell me where, oh where shall I go?
