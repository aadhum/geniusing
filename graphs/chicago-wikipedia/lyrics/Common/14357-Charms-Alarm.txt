Elvis Presley Jr., tryin to be somethin that you ain't
No daps, y'all are hoes, y'all go on stage
And take off all your clothes; then you strike a pose
You knows and I knows, that's how you sell your record
Because your shit is butt, you gotta get naked
But you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me
I said you're wack, you're wack, showin your body to me
You got no soul man, and you need to get a pound
