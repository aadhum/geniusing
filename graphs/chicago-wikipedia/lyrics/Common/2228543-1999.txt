"Still gettin mine, in the" "ONE" "NINE" "NINE" "NINE"
Yo, just relax, take it easy, slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was movin too fast, yaknawimsayin?
Check it, it's like I'm fightin for freedom, writin for freedom
These record company niggas, I don't like when I see em
Shitted on, so many rappers
Must've thought I was solo, the name just ain't the U-Ac
No mo', still together
Like in the ghetto photo wit one nigga in the chair
Holdin liquor in despair, gang signs in the air
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice wit metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry, my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life
Common Sense
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warrin' like a G-Child
They tried to assassinate me God, like Martin on the bal-cony
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
