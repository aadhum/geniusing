You have come so far
You've got so far to go, yeah
Sweetheart, you know that you most
Important, at least on the West Coast
I'm just trippin', it's somethin' about your throat
You think different and understand how I float
Got cribs on both Coasts
But, I'm a Chicago-getter
You get down, but you ain't a golddigger
You got the soul with the figure to match
Creative with the gifts, plus he hit it from the back!
And places we ain't supposed to
We make the music - baby, you on the vocals
International lover, I never stay local
Go to places that you never been
Beautiful outside, even better when it's in
You have arrived, girl - you can come again!
C'mon!
You sexy, I know brothers try to spit to you
But, I'm the only one that can get to you
Lifting you
my drive is shifting you
And as long I'm in your town, I'mma stay
+Faithful+ (Heh!)
You was there when the marks tried to steal my car
Snappin' with me, that's just how real you are
Sophisticated woman, you understand a man
You don't call all the time just to see where I am
Put a "G" in your hand, make sure you're livin' alright
Makin' love is me and I'mma give it all night
Turn over in the morning, make it warmer and better
Long as we can be, we can come together
C'mon!
