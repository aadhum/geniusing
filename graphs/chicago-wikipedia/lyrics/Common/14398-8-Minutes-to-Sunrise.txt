8 minutes to sunrise
Oh baby now, what are we gonna do? (I don't know..)
Pressure is mountin
It was once said by Black Thought that things fall apart
Knew I shouldn't have been messin with dude's girl from start
But I pimp from the heart
Plus me and sister blend before we got intimate
Friend or no friend,
Cause dude'll drink a pile of Mo' and defile her
I ain't here to start on this [nigga]
for me to wreck his broad
You could tell what I thought of this [nigga]
Nickname was Smoke
he called shots on the deck
So I wasn't tryin to call his bluff, by his persona
You could see, he think he tough!
This is Wild like the West I'm like Jesse on the run, uhh
The streets is watchin, out is one way
I put myself in his Nike's
"Aight man, somebody bonin my lady"
Probably snap like Rod-man
My plan was to meet at this bar called the Tiki
'round four, when she was comin she would beep me
drinkin zombies, becomin one by now
On some "Nobody's Supposed to Be Here" [shit] like Deborah Cox
Pressure puh-pressure what? The pressure's cookin
Not that I'm spooked of dude, I could whup him
But he was on the horn informin the rest of them hoodlums
Usually I wouldn't fight over a woman, old girl had a sun-shine
I'm thinkin this is monkey bar [shit]
Wondered if this plan was designed to get me
Like 40 goin North I'm doin 50
But then it hit me (hit me) it hit me (hit me)
It hit me (hit me) it hit me
