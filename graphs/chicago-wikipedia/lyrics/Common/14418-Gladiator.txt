Nothing you can do (x4)
Are you not entertained?
cause it'll be platinum
Though I might've did The Light, I don't run from the dark
and start fights
The warrior archetype like Kimbo Slice
It's strength in the beard
A beast amongst boys like
Paul I'm revered
Vroof, vroof vroof vroof vroof Vroof vroof well
Like Jacob Jewel, I keep clientele
I might smoke a joint but I won't take the L
I knew a fat broad that broke the scale
Still touched down cause I was off Artell
Had dreams of breaking Mike Vick out of jail
Took the underground rail to the NFL
I rebel, NYSL
Here to leave a trail like Nelson Mand-el
My words is the sword, my skill is the shield
A legend like Will, Smith with the steel
I could save the world when shit get for real
Skinny George Foreman, all in your grill
My drive VROOM is how I stay the livest
Your guys got you gassed, my flow is a hybrid
I'm amped like wattage
Any moment opponents drop out like college
Kneel and pay homage to the rap Ziggy Stardust
Stadium hands in the air fists balled up
Defeat your whole army like this is Sparta
So don't violate or you'll get violated
Syncopated is the style that I fight with, write with
change your face up like a white chick
