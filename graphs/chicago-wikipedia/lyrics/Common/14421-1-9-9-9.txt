"Still getting mine, in the 1 9 9 9"
Yo, just relax, take it easy slow down
I had this, I had this friend of mine
Who just, you know, he was moving too fast, you known I'm saying?
I told him to slow down, he said the sun don't chill
I said, I said still, I said still, you gotta
Just appreciate life, sit back, don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin mine
No matter the year, no matter the place, no matter the time
Check it
It's like I'm fighting for freedom, writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors, when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts
stalk rhythms
paid dues, bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
U-Ac
photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair
gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry
my poetry's a penitentiary, track is visitation
Sentences is life,
I'm like chief up in this demonstration
You squirm with discomfort, wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
And all the places I went to, always played the low
with the red eye
Chi to L-I
I thought y'all knew, every year I grew, I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed,
praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to, that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
king of the simply, bore in mic
Yo yo, some get Range Rovers, some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga, game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles, I'm warring like a G-Child
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to 'sassinate me god, like Martin on the balcony
Lyrically I put a hit on 'em, cause I'm the style "Nitti"
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
till the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Less than a hour she was giving me neck
