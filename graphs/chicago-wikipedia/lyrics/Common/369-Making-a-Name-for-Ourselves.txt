Common Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin
I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
I can tell by how you write, you the type to run in a fight
Cameoed
charted
I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism
fuck the rhythm, I hit him
I want him got and I get him, auction his wack ass off, then bid him
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't "F" with me,
stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel, faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle? I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun, but I walk with three shadows
With Allah, my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
I'll hit you in your chest so hard, your shoulders will touch
"Stepping to me is like going to the county being a neutron"
I pursue sound fairs, relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs, I throw down theirs
On knots, I landed
players get played like Hamlet
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles, rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose, I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
Couldn't make the transition from B-boy to C-note stance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
"Fucking with Canibus"
Yo, the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you, spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical, hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given, MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My face don't belong in The Source, it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
I'll turn your ass into "The Artist Formerly Known As"
You gay-ass fag, I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked, then make you hug a cactus, you bastard
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page forty
Put this in your CD-ROM
WWW-dot-Canibus-dot-com
That was sweating me off the "Music Makes Me High" remix
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
liquid aluminum like the T2
Beasts from the East part two, coming to see you
I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
