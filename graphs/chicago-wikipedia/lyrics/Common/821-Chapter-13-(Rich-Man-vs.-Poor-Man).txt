Let's talk about money
Ynot get the money
Common Sense want the money
Let's talk about money
I be the one they call Petey
I'm Poe as Edgar Allan
Fresh like air, well dressed, yes the LS is here
I appear on piers with my peers
The Imperial like margarine, I'm butter
fly like my Lear, I jet
Lookin' at my fake Gucci, it's about that time
It's time for some percolator
Harold's Chicken
A good combination
Well I'm a two timer of women that are three times a lady
and may Ms. Goldberg say
"Yo Whoopie, there it is"
Call me E cause I equal MC squared
In the Biz, marks know I got the key, to get the girl's noses
Open like the vapors
more pub than the papers
More papers than the press
I didn't grow grow up up po' po'
Bills upon bills upon bills is what you have
Before you get your check then you already spend half
I'm a reflection of my section and my section 8
Enough
I own 8 sections of the world, where I'm sexin' 8 girls
To have them comin' in (ohhh yes) 8 seconds
I told Victoria her secret you suck, like Sucrets
"Ain't a damn thing funny"
Rhymes I exchange like stock
I'm live like stock
I rock like Prudential
making (haha) from O
That's mucho dinero, like Robert De Niro
A robber's dinero
a hero like the sandwich
I'm fancy, man, I tickles like the French
Johnny but like Bench
I press on like Lee
I stan' like Lee, while you stagger like Lee
Yo, bums I rush like adrenaline
I'm royal when I flush, your highest hush'll get mushed
Like a sleigh dog, I slay dogs who are under me
I'm over men; call me Doberman, cause I'm a Pinscher of pennies
That's pretty
leave your city green from all the money I spent
Real friendly like an officer, friendly and a gentleman
Friendly like neighbors, not Jim
But like Gomer I got piles of loot
Attention salute
Even if I threw garbage on the ground I couldn't pollute
Man, I'm too rich for that, bitch!
The black man of course he was po' (yeah)
The white man, he was rich (uh-huh)
And the Chinese man, he owned a sto' (aight c'mon)
the black man lived on Beat Street
The white man lived on Wall Street
red by his neck
The Chinese man got 'noid and broke out like a peon
Leon's
(...What's that?)
Barbecue, that is! (Oh...)
Rib tips, hotsauce, mild sauce, fries, and chicken
And if you givin' your papers to a broad you'se a dummy
