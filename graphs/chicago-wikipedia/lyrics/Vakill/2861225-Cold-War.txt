John Baptiste du Sable
My name's symbolic where gang insignias is indigenous
Empty the straps until the clips filing chapter 13
Kinda frigid and the heat is hell's parallel
As gang leaders control the streets from a narrow cell
Girbauds
If you ain't affiliated, expect visits
GDs and BDs
Whoever told y'all the cold war's over
Tell 'em bring their ass to
Chicago... Chicago... Chicago...
[repeat]
It's the backdrop to a 6 NBA title crown
Playgrounds where slain hoop idols found
The bridal gown Capone and the mafia married in
Colors is redundant
Banging is determined by cocked caps and hand signs
From Elgin to up in the Hundreds
Where GDs get love in abundance
And El Rukns and Vice Lords was once government funded
A place where today you can win Lotto
And then tomorrow
Hammers'll turn you to a milk carton print model
Cause that ferris wheel at Navy Pier
You think it's gravy here
'Til the coroner's picking slugs out your baby's hair
Altgeld
Only short commons
Warrants and court summons
And smoked-out baby's moms you used to let snort something
Bishop in Juice
So I spit it out with a mouth full of antiseptic rinse
Tryna change the scent of it
From pussy to peppermints
