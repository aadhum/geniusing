I’m from the era were we murk the bearer of bad news like Leonidas
And family don’t speak till tragedy reunite us
Who wanna test V.A. sword
I wanna meet the Fockers
No Gaylord
My flow is god’s relic in essence
With a delicate pressin
I can blow you to maggot delicatessen
The upper echelons about effective as proactive to herpes
The gods fully armored
Apology talk is void
I write the sickest shit to hit white sheets since cross burning Caucasoid
Clappin’ clients with a grill that’s cryogenic
The game will never be fixed
Cause every new nigga heavily bricks
Or exploited like 70′s flicks
Machine and beast cleverly mixed so
Fuck around and get carried by six
Like the nuggets in 76
Uckfay ouyay
Want some positive shit?
Mother fucker play Lupe
