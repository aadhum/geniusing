Here's what they think about you) --> Ice Cube
Vakill ain't put a record out in four years
That nigga is not hot
- Ah, Vakill fell off
I discharge the nicest shit between bars like reformed felons
There will be none after this nut, I'm tubes-tyin this art, so
Fuck Sports, I will EA-curse the Source covers
Where I'm from we murder like it was legalized
Justice system and crime rate are never equalized
So many beefs left undone, and birds that's uncooked
You can die from salmonella and E. coli
