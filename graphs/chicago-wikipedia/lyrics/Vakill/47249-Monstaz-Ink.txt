spitting fireball rocks
Before they call pops had bodies in walls and crawl spots
Everybody is holding and probably not squeezing
And last year niggas albums did more flopping then a Vlade Divac season
Shit I'm warning them flinch and the itching trigger finger is gon start forming a clench
My flow as fury as the scorn of a bitch
I'm a pimp, pussy fall in my lap like a strip club full of clumsy crippled bitches
I'm tsunami with the spitting,
Y'all faggots wish the champs lose but that ain't chips on y'all shoulders, switch your shampoos
Spit bars that will knock out whole alliances
Out cold, y'all about the be outsold and client-less
You got no money and mo problems you backwards Frank White
Who got issues with the flow?
You in XXL 'Step Yo Rap Game Up' section 12 issues in a row
