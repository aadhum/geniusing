And that's not the worst, add on the megahertz
Throwin' bodies like the high seas crashin the earth
I wanna fuck your whore in the mouth because I hate her guts
Ya see that the hold of god of a man
I don't like crowds feelin' me no matter how stiff they stand
And beat the odds like an abusive freak show owner
And fuck edit, engineer, let the swears stay
Like I'm gettin any motherfuckin' airplay
Cause to shook up to bein' an assassin
It's bein ash the first two syllables
