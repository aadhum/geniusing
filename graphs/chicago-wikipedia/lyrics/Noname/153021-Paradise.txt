Tony the tiger told me not to lie
I drifted to the other side of
Blue and white of
Paradise
Of Paradise
Licking lemonade crunchy curls off of little thumbs
You wanna grow up now
You wanna be a big kid pushing metal carts down a
Blank grocery aisle
Life is different
Golden ticket
Cotton candy
Don’t you miss it?
I know I do
I know I wanna get my songs on iTunes
Then see the world
Then write new music
That feeds the world
I’m not black enough to go back to Africa
Fast enough
Decaffeinated on the grounds of a massacre
Nightcap, right back to my record deal
I wanna help people
I wanna be rich
I wanna be the Bob Marley of this
Rap music
My whole-hearted melody
Lost in amphetamines
Trapped in a box, I was drinking more Kerosene
Believe the reason why breathing is so appeasing
I met the angel of death in the
Breath of a gothic eden
You not hearing this
You not dilated peoples
Hear me roar
Die within
Lie with him
On a top notch bed of locusts
Oh this is life
Empty bank account and a kitchen knife
I quit the weed
I had to leave a friend in need
It’s been 30 days since she looked at me
And I’m sorry
Good things come
Sometimes
Good things come
Good things come
