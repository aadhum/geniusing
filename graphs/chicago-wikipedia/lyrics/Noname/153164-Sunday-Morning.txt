All my raps whisper unintelligence
sediment
You don’t know the half Mr. Bubble Bath
Epitaph
Jaded in the grass
If Google maps can see my house
Yo, I wonder who is watchin' me
Satellite hypocrisy like, right up the block from me
Another brown boy down
Another mother crying cause another brown boy found
Bang bang
Sound like violins
Poverty was made to door frame all the violence
Knock knock and guess who's not there
The police
And guess who don’t care
The people
Sunday sunday morning
And the birds are lovely
Sunday sunday morning
And the birds are lovely
Sunday sunday morning
And my mama love me
And my granny love me
And Moni love me
Close your third eye and look what you real eyes
And look what you realize
Your water is privatized
You liquor is idolized
The government mastermind
Now that's the Illuminati
And that's after your
Soul
Universal mind control
Let me see you robot
Racism construct
Let me see you robot
They would've ended war
If war didn't make um rich
I ain’t tryna help you smoke if you
Ain’t tryna help me quit
I could even paint Jackson
Where the pollack sits
Concrete satchmo
I’m a photo
Shake me up
Like me glitter
Like me thinner
Gingerbread snapped
I’m the training ground for a rainbow
It’s like pop pop
Skittle bag
Ask me where the riddle at
And i’ll serve you Ritalin
Double-coated in cinnamon
Sunday hymns
Praise the lord
And the drugs that raised me
Baptized in saline
They found my parachute under the rubble
I found redemption under the tunnel
Don’t get trapped
