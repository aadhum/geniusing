I swear I only drink the violin I meant the gin
Understand, makin' holidays with the fam
Christmas don't feel like my wishlist no more
Raise your hands, grab the ceiling fan
Know you're a helicopter, hella proper
No one stop her
Let her fly, let her fly, let her fly, let me trip.
Nothing feels better than the falling, bathroom stalling before the vomit arrives
I'm still wishing him here, fuck this stupid rap career
Fuck this stupid rap career, I'm still wishing him here
Great Granny where you been?
Uncle Henry where you been?
Uncle Maine where you been?
