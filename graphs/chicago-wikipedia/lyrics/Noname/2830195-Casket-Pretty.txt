All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
I've been searching for God in the bottle he gave me
Ashes to Ashes, dearly departed, regarded as Holy
Dont hold me, dont hold me
When niggas is dying and dying
And I'm afraid of the dark
Blue and the white
Badges and pistols rejoice in the night
And we watch the news
And we see him die tonight
Tonight the night his baby said goodbye
Roses in the road, teddy bear outside
Bullet there on the right
Where's love when you need it
Too many babies in suits
Too many babies in suits
Back before the dawn
Ricochet the pawn
Bullet in the chest
You ain't mean no harm
Collecting your check mate
I know you in love with the power
It's flowers at every occasion
I need me a medicine man
Somebody heal me
Somebody take my hand
All of my niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
Niggas is casket pretty
Ain't no one safe in this happy city
I hope you make it home
I hope to God that my tele' don't ring
