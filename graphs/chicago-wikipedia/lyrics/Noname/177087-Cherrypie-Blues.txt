Here we are, inside of the movies
The last time you touched me
The last time you knew me
It's a doozie how we jump back
Lungs fat with a coughin
How often
Everything you said to me was dead to me
Let it be a bygone how you python
Mama said never dance wit snakes wit the lights on
Watch me shimmy
Til the lights go dimy
While I leave him the juice
And I drink all the henny
Wit her little raps in her bottle
Genie gypsy booze
Booze she would swallow
Kiss the apostle when she couldn't find her Jesus
She's just a little lost
A little lost
A little lonely after her and lover boy
Didn't hit it off
Off with the offering
Properly ask the auctioning block
Nonchalant
Cherry on the top
Whose a slave in the slave house
Made out pretty
Lost my love, found my city
Everything I ever was
I lost in the cigarette smoke tonight
I know this feeling won't last forever but
God damn it still hurt
It still hurt like
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
I got the cherrypie blues tonight
