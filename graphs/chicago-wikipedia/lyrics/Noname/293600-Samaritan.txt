Had a dollar and dream
Inside my pocket
Took a step to the left and start walkin
Talkin' like
"How am I gon' get home tonight?
I left my bus card, on the night stand
By the kitchen."
Samaritan, samaritan help me please
Samaritan, Samaritan be good to me
Samaritan, Samaritan be good to me
He told me my life span
Would span a lifetime of phone calls and staplers and people to piss off
But I reminded him I barely could read
I graduated high school
Happy I even got C's
Cause the D's and F's was lookin' hella grimey
Just happy to come behind me
Don't ask me what I look like in the darkness
Sit still for too long, your own bones become cathartic
"She's so lovely, rappin' about her broken
Wearin her false lashes and hopin she gettin chosen
You a female rapper. Don't rap about that shit
You 'supose to be a bad bitch
Or at least a little confident."
Welcome to verse two
This where it gets sticky
The dollar I once had, had dream of a buck fifty
Even the money'll leave you for the money
Had the nerve to look at me and tell me, I was hella bummy
Hella funny comin' from a nigga with a homeless soul
See commercials how they out here sellin' broken dreams
Mild situations of escape, check the Oprah show
Couldn't fly out the hood with a boneless wing
Twistin' some shit
sippin' some shit that bubble like champagne
Hilary Swank shit
Million dollars a deal
That fact that he so chill about it, compel em' to hate
The women that I court like appelates compel him to think that
I only do it, bad, like Blanket's dad
That's Michael Jackson, you sleepin, but how you sleep on that?
When I'm takin' niggas higher, like it's tree on deck
And it's tree on deck
Canada Dry on the rocks,
The poetry started in coffee shops, I'm used to the grind
I could wait for the cream, it's no sugar in that
Not even strings attached, Gepetto could pull him an act
Until a nigga records gettin' mad spins in your Cul-de-sac
Don't distract, though the key to this is preservation
Just see them snares as a symbol for the simple and it's sinful
Have a glass of ginger ale, It's a celebration
