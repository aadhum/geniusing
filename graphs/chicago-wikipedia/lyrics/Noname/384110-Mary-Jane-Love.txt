My first love, so how you goin' leave and let the roaches in?
I ain't got a bunch of money, walls is closing in
Tic-tac totally, undermining your thoughts
I need more exes, I need more hoes
14 blunts like a morphine shower
You ain't re-writing Leviticus and call it a wrap
And national caps, I'm cheifin'
I know 14 ghosts and they chasin' the pack
That ain't shit to coy with, shit to toy with
These paper airplanes make a beautiful joystick, oo
Smokin' a cloud
Pacqui-di-ao
Couple of hits
One more cypher and I'm callin' it quits
