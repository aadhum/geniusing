Cause I can't see the sunshine in the morning
In the evening, baby girl I'm so alone
You ever find yourself in a dark alley
With a blunt and a shot glass
And tickets to Cali?
With a dream and a suitcase, and a man I can trust
Mister Jackson, Daniel
Nina Simone alone teachin the candles
Like, "You don't know how to burn, baby try again."
I know the lady in the mirror, and I seen a faker grin
This is happy is fightin' back the actin'
This is cryin' fakin' all the laughin'
I'm good, you can see me get my smile on
I feel like wishin' is only good for kids
Birthdays, and genies, Aladdin taught me how to live
You got to take what you want in this life
Even the memories of makin it through the darkest nights
