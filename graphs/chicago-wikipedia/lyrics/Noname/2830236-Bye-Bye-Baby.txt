My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
Before you leave, don't look down
God will help you spread your wings
My baby needs some milk and honey
My baby needs some milk and honey
Ask me why she hesitated
Almost waited, waiting room
Play date up to heaven soon
Soon I will see the King
He reminds me
Some give presents before they're even ready
I could see that she loves me
I know her heart is heavy
Somebody let the yellow in
Bye bye blue
I'm gonna fall in love again
