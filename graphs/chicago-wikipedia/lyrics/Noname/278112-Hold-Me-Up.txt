When I get cold
And I get hungry
And I get weary
Nobody loves me
Mama hold me up
Daddy pays the bills, but mama holds me up
Don’t make me feel holy like an ice cream Saturday
Icy, I see you wanna talk shit
Now you wanna shake my hand cause I know Chano
You could've changed the world while you studying me
Man I could've changed the world if it wasn’t for these
My confessional, handwriting be regrettable, illegible
Somebody help me right my wrongs
Butterfly doors like stuntin' is a way of life
On my soul, when I get my check, I’mma get a chain
All gold inscription with no name
in a sea of chocolate
That’s too much poetry, like you can’t rap?
You can’t act hard, you can’t Trap God
You came from the other side of the black card
So how you gonna try to be a rap star?
My mama hold me up
She said I’m good enough
My mama hold me up
