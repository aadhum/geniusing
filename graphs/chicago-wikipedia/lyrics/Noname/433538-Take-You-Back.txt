If Spike Lee had a girlfriend who could rap she would be me
Mo' Betta natural
But mo pretty weavy
Socio political individual black with a perm
3 dimensional naps had to burn
Slave life
Shimmer and sparkle in day light when the money come in quick
Tryna get to Noname
Vagabond gypsy
So I'm having second thoughts
And I really wanna get back together
With you, if you will have me darling
I never should have let you go
Never should have let you go
First things first I miss you
And your paper thin lips
The way I kiss you, the way you hit back
Smack
Why you gotta love me so hard
Bae, I'm already faded
And taste like a bitter sweet memory
Lullaby the paranoia with the cashews
If you gon get crazy
Go nutty
You ain't never seen me story tell
I L’Oréal, I beautify
I saw you in the crawl space across from the hallways
They don't get it, they don't know you
