At night I think of you
I want to be your lady baby
If you were my man
If you were my man
If you were my man
I'd give my all to you
I'd give my all to you if you were my man
Like I'm a child of Destiny
I'd cater to you
Be a waiter for you
Get too cocky then it's later for you
And bring out the ice
Whip cream, strawberry
Fantastic
Edible arrange arrangement in my basket
She don't need no ass just to hold me down
Like she got a brain
Bet I wife her down
Bet I take her to IKEA and start cashin' out
Nigga smoke a black and mild
Who yo daddy now?
We two peas in a pod
He's the epilogue for romance
Sometimes you should wait,
Oooh wait a minute
We should wait a minute
I ain't married
You ain't married
Maybe this is sinnin'
