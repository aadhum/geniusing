[Background: "It was great, apparently I've never been on live television before..."]
Noname off the drugs
Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say
The reefer got me like "whoa, slow down"
A casanova with catalogs of his dinner dates
Make me feel special, Jay Electro-Soul
I need a nigga to follow me to the rabbit hole
And fall in where I fall in
I'm ballin' I'm out control
I'm ballin' I'm out control
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
Everything is everything
A cigarette for wedding ring
The matrimony catalyst for secondary
Get to know me in Chicago
How I go where you stay
Unorthodox paradox in a pair of Doc's
With an overbite
You remind me to love myself for the principle
For the kid inside, til the end of time
Happy go lucky was a time, umm okay
Noname off the drugs
Noname quit the weed
Telefone delight
My honeybee red black and green
Majestic queen
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say love
This for my homies; my umi say
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
If it's not how I want it
It's just how I need it
