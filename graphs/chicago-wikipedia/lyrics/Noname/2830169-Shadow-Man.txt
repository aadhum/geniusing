How do you see me?
How do you love me?
How to do you remember me?
Amaurotic nightingale
I hope that darkness keeps you well
When I can't fall asleep at night
I blindly taught myself to fight
Aw shadow man shadow box, please keep your hands up
And if you get knocked down don't forget to stand up
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Shadow man shadow box, dance in the dark with me
This resurrected agony there's apathy for caskets
Everything I ever loved I lost in the magic
When I die there's 27 rappers at my funeral
Moses wrote my name in gold and Kanye did the eulogy
Remember all the bashfulness, understand the truancy
Here I stand in front of a college dropout
My music was a church when my spirit hopped out
Met a gypsy in LA and she reading my palm tree
Mysterious situation like kissing the concrete i.e getting money
I been close to heaven
Baby claim he love me, hold me down forever
I never should have bought this halo
He waiting for me at his table
My funeral a Disney fable
Cause the king bout to take me home
Preach, church, tabernacle
Southern is my bloodline we know it'll come time...to go
And though I leave like alumni
And if ashes turn to ashes then I'm back in my first form
Morbid or late
Lord give Lord take
Viva la muerte, mortal man
Less love, more hate
More like mortician, we meet our fate
Funeral home lookin like a home that I used to live in
Open my soul but then it'll end with an open casket
[Verse 3: Smino]
Tippy toe on a tightrope
Leaning on green and it gon be a dice roll
I'm feenin a feline who mindset Afeni
I got two packs for us
Sticky dro in the tight roll
Cleaning my grievances
As a lil' heathen I
Sat pledge allegiance out
Never believed in yall
System I needed more
It's gon be niggas boomin' at my funeral
Tell em play Metro Boomin' at my funeral
St. Louis taught me death could be your neighbor, stay away
Don't take the family for granted better days await
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
Bless the nightingale
Darkness keep you well
