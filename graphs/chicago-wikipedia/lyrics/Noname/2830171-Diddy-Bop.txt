Henny invented the catalyst for happiness in my cup
This sound like kiddies on the playground when mama was running up
Ooooooh, you about to get your ass beat
This sound like niggas complaining when their bitches like Raz-B
B2K in the stereo, we juke in the back seat
Or juke in the basement, in love with my KSWISS’s
This feel like jumping in a pool and I’m knowing I can’t swim
Ooooooh, you about to get your ass beat
For stealing that twenty dollars like ”baby, just ask me”
Mama say she love, love, loved us
When the lights was off we had to stay with cousins
Granny at the BBQ with petty ass husband
After school matters like I’m needing that stipend right now
Kennicott parking lot got caught with the blunt like “wow wow”
Run, run, run, mama say come home before the streetlights do
Ice cream on my front porch in my new FUBU and my A1’s too
Watching my happy block my whole neighborhood hit the diddy bop
With stars in my pocket, dreaming bout making my hood glow
I am a meteor on a crash course towards Earth across the cosmos
Versus Perseus to the father
Of his birth to tell the truth, that I’m his real son
Get blocked, I’ma build one
Get blocked, I’ma build two
Hope that you see it’s a staircase
Keith Ape tryna pill paint
Stop overreacting, it’s past my curfew I’m out after 6
Happily making my accident
Mama gon’ whoop on my ass again
Pray that I’m making my way before 8 and I might have to sneak in the back again
Hope that Memorial traffickin’
Hope that she stopping for gas again
Run, run, run, mama say come home before the streetlights do
Ice cream on my front porch in my new FUBU and my A1’s too
Watching my happy block my whole neighborhood hit the diddy bop
With stars in my pocket, dreaming bout making my hood grow
Watching my happy block my whole neighborhood hit the diddy bop
Watching my happy, watching my happy ooh ooh
Watching my happy block my whole neighborhood hit the diddy bop
