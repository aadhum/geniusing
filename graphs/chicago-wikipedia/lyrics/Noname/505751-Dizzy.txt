The last time I seen Dizzy Gillespie
He was smiling at me
Singing to a southern sun
Set back in Tallahassee
Glass of white milk, lungs still black
The revolution won't be televised, it's tele-fine
Get a call from Khadija
"How you living girl?", single
Common coming over
He trading me all his water for my chocolate
I'm loving the music
Digging the sounds
Somebody tell Jay Electronica I love him
walk to the bike
Ride to the park
Find a new god in the water
Pretend like the grass getting greener
And smile like Dizzy Gillespie
