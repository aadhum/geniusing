Open apology
For little black girl, don't you follow me
Dummie down a violent metaphor
Who be the magic in my magic hour
Baby, liquor gone
And lick the wound
Baby masochist in afternoon
And pray my fame is coming soon
Cause maybe I'm not talented enough for angel wings
I'm a maple tree, got my niggas with me
For a minute
Ode to Chicago, fuck the Chiraq
Ode to Chicago, and the Harold's chicken
Uncle Remus' duplex with the Cadillac
Utopian aristocats for cats getting money
But still smoke reggie
Ain't left home in a week, I'm busy hiding
They keep telling me that I'm next in line but
I'm still at home and I live with my momma
If rap don't work, it's not too late for college
They think I got it better than I got it
We do it for the people, and my momma
And the city on my shoulder, and the babies on the come up
