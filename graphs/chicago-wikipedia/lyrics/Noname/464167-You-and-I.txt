Our city feel like water over inexperienced swimmers
On tandem we'll ride out
Had a dream about that
How you know your girl was keen on jazz?
I leaned on Jack
Daniels dismantled my solitude
We be naked on the rooftop, chillin' and shit
Tumultuous relationship
I didn't know I could burn so good
May your words be colorful
