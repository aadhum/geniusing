Miss Nina Simone, Jimmy Jones
Missy Elliot musically were my relatives
Never forget my Andre
Papi mi casa es su casa
Baby I made an entr√©e
Maybe I make your mom's plate
Maybe we not gon' sleep tonight
In the night you and I laugh about how you Gemini
Already fried the chicken
But leftovers was my inner thigh
Nah I'm lying, I'm just playing
I'm trying to re-imagine abracadabra for poverty
Like poof I made it disappear
Proof I'm made of happiness
Everything is everything
So molly makes them joyful now
When I get down, I'm already up
Molly the water, I keep the drink in the cup
My druggy is druggy, we just some kids out of luck
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But Fuck it, we'll live forever
I sold my name for seven bags of Skittles
On Sunny Set Boulevard
Please tell me God is rainbow pretty
Nobody understands my songs
Aloe vera sentences to heals the scars
Of rental cars to Malibu to Shangri-La
Ooh, my cigarette burning, my momma be calling
Why I still be thrifting, accustomed to
Wearing hand-me-downs
Why my Cinderella a cinder block
For my family now
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But Fuck it, we'll live forever
We gon' live forever like Aaliyah
Look how they did Rekia
When I say that ass is a mouthful like kujichagulia
Following bright ideas, 'cause I'm victim to colorism
I mean like high key
They hold my life in low regards hoping I'm hopeless
But I've been in love for so long like Janet Jackson poems
Emitting pheromones so I don't got to bear it alone
They ain't tryna' to see me shine, shine
Bullet on my time, time
But fuck it, I'll live forever
They ain't trying to see us shine, shine
Bullet on our time, time
But Fuck it, we'll live forever
