As a youngin I was good, my momma worked 2 jobs to get us out the hood
My auntie used to keep me, she was gangsta like you should
And she would whip my ass every chance that she could
So I rebelled, started fighting back was the only fucking key there
Shit ain't never good getting beat on by a female
My older cousins used to get me, showed me what the streets bout
Til they let a older nigga come and knock my teeth out
I was on my own got a pocket knife I'm striking back
My momma found out and moved up north
That's when I got worse, met a bunch of project boys
We was vice lords living round all them boys
My daddy came around once tried to tell me I was fucking up
I ain't seen your ass in 10 years homie don't fuck with us
Told him to beat it like MJ
I'm in the streets, me and Valentine, BFN, Whiteboy
Lil One and ? roam through the hood all night boy
Work reach the D i was on the team, we got it in
But the Spanish folks tried to take they block back
Every lick we hit we like fuck work we buying guns
I caught a robbery and got probation, 90 days later shoot out, got caught with a bag
Now I'm in the joint waiting to get out
But I gotta get paid, I got work and got down
Ten bands a day, you niggas hearing me? 8 months later I'm popped, drug conspiracy
Niggas saying they gone knock me off, I came home ain't a motherfucker touched this boss
