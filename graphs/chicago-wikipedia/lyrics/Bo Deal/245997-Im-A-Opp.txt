If I fuck wit' Keef I can't fuck wit' Rico
I fuck wit' Herb I can't fuck wit' Durk
Fuck wit' Samson can't fuck wit' Reese, can't fuck wit' Louie my city hurt
If I fuck wit' Fredo can't fuck wit' Duck
Fuck wit' Dee I can't fuck wit' Chuck
If I fuck wit' Bump I can't fuck wit' Cam
Ima opp nigga quit woofin' at me, when you see me then pop me
If you think that ima opp, when you see me then pop me
Right now I'm posted on the block, ain't a nigga done shot me
Ain't a nigga done robbed me
I'm eatin' nigga you starvin'
My clan thick
run on up and get bodied
I fuck wit' Durk, I fuck wit' Reese, I fuck wit' Keef and SD
Don't get it twisted I'm gangsta
my niggas ride wit' that heat
And what we cookin' that beef
we poppin' at you and yo peeps
All my shorties be squeezin', on the getaway while you bleedin'
I'm scorchin' ho you ain't hot nigga
no views or hints when you drop nigga
