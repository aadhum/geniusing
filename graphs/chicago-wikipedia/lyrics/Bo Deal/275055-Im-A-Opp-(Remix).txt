If I fuck wit' Keef, I can't fuck wit' Rico
I fuck wit' Herb, I can't fuck wit' Durk
Fuck wit Samson can't fuck wit' Reese
Can't fuck wit' Louie my city hurt
If I fuck wit' Fredo, can't fuck wit' Duck
Fuck wit' E, I can't fuck wit' Chuck
If I fuck with Bump I can't fuck wit' Cam'
Safe to say that my city fucked
Fake niggas say that I'm oppin', stop it
Fuck it then I'm oppin', pop me
I ain't boppin' I'm oppin', stop me
I'm supportin' my city
I'm Mafioso like Gotti
I don't swap verses ain't shit free
Got a Lambo, got a Phantom Ghost, got a 'Rari,
Niggas sayin' that I flip-flopped, stop wit' all that lyin' nigga
I'm K.T.G. I'm M.I.C, I'm loyal to my crew
yo' whole squad fufu
fuck wit' Rico Recklezz
Mix this street shit with this rap shit and have you end up on the news
Holdin' my crotch middle finger to cops and the federals
Ya'll tunin' down them projects
Chiraq
