I got life in the trunk,
30 stacks in my pocket
Chopper in the back seat, my young nigga gone pop it
15 he gonna murder some, 16 he gonna murder some
17 he gonna murder some, 18 he gonna murder some
BSM
Cause I'll come to your house and kick the door in like them narcs do
Let him know I’m strapped in here, he can lose his life in here
He can die tonight in here; hit him with a fucking beer
I got pistol in my pocket, pull it out and pop it
My young niggas wilding in Chiraq catching bodies
GBE, we mobbing, Chief Sosa co-starring
My niggas tote pistols, it’s a issue, please don’t start 'em
Them pistols get to popping, bodies get to dropping
Smoking wheezy, feeling gucci, on that We Be Steady Mobbin'
Like Flocka, Oh Let's Do It;
