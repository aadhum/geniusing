Wasn't looking for it to heal the scar
But today I was riding on Lonely Boulevard
Wishing all wasn't lost and then there, there you came
Honestly a star shooting through the scene
In the sky, that's where we are, and I'm tryna catch a beam
See them other girls, yeah they try, but they ain't fly like you
Tonight belongs to you
Tonight belongs to you
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you
You made a storm up in Ibiza, oh, oh what a dream
I close my eyes baby, now I don't wanna go
I'mma star, cause if I'm dreaming I don't wanna wake up

Flo Rida, ayo Jeremih, lemme holla at lil mama right quick
I'll bust my gun gun gun gun
