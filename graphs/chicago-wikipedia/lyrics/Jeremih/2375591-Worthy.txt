I know these other girls can't do it like I do it (like I do it)
I know you ain't used to it
To the better things
Baby you deserve the better things
Let me show it, prove it
What these other hoes ain't doing
Let a real bitch do it, like I can
See how you lay at night
Tired of that nigga
When you know you be by my side (by my side)
Shit feels much better
Overdue for your lovin' baby (baby), I don't want no one else (one else)
Ain't no way I would do you dirty (dirty)
What you're doing to me (to me)
Ain't no way that I'm worried baby
They don't see what I see
Ooh you worthy baby, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy baby, you worthy
I know you are the one
Girl why you with him
Why must we play
Oh, we saw this coming
See how you lay at night
Tired of that nigga
We know you be by my side
Shit feels much better
Ain't no way I would do you dirty
What you're doing to me
Ain't no way that I'm worried baby
They don't see what I see
Ooh you worthy baby, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy, you worthy, you worthy (you worthy)
Ooh you worthy baby, you worthy
