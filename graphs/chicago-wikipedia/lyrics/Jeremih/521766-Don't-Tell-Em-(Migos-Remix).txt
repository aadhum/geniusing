[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don't you tell 'em what we do
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em
You ain't even, you ain't even even gotta tell 'em
Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out tho
You got gifts bring em down the south pole
Marathon doll gon' puttin' miles
Don’t you worry bout it might gon' work it out
Only is you got me feeling like this oohh why, why, why, why
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Don't tell 'em that I beat it up like fight night
But she did tell me that you're small like a Mike & Ike
But everybody know that she selfish
Pull up in Ferraris, my bitch rockin' Versace
Nobody can find us, we coolin' on islands
You ain't gotta tell him that I got you outta Follies
She ain't know that I'm handsome and wealthy
Bentley Mulsanne I speed it up
My girl wanna be a Giuseppe stepper
I'm Michael Phelps, won a gold medal
Hit it with the left then hit it with the right
Knockout just call me Mayweather
So many Benjamins on me
Might mistake me for a bank teller
[Hook: Jeremih]
I'm dabbin' in Maison Margielas, don't tell 'em they might get jealous
Her forehead on my pelvis, I don't cuff 'em, I don't settle
You a champion, you deserve a gold medal
Smackin' a secret
[Hook: Jeremih]
