And like that, we gone
Haven’t you noticed I had my eyes on you, you, you
Girl you know it’s something, something, something
When we got to touching, touching, touching
The neighbors knockin’, knockin’, knockin’
Ugh,and you know my flag red
But shawty God damn
Girl I got the blues, blues, blues, blues
Dick game dummy leave her stuck, stranded
Especially when I get behind her like a ad-lib
She love to be around my artillery
Captivated by illegal activity
clavicle
Bang, bang, bang, Friday, Pops
