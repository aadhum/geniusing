Yeah, freaky conversation, got you worryin 'bout temptation
I pop that bra, she pop that off, with yo' emotions
Don't get lost in it
And you soakin', got yo' ocean, I get lost in it
We at the W, that's why we always keep winnin'
We all know, we all know
We got the, we got the bomb, no roll up
I'm in the, the mini bar, it's going up
We toast up, we toast up, for no reason
She go up, I put it down, now we eatin'
Let's post up, cause most times you be leavin'
I know now, I know now, you believe me
Yeah, freaky conversation, got you worryin 'bout temptation
She got work, she takin' off, she got that work, she need a boss
I pop that bra, she pop that off, with yo' emotions
Don't get lost in it
And you soakin', got yo' ocean, I get lost in it
We at the W, that's why we always keep winnin'
