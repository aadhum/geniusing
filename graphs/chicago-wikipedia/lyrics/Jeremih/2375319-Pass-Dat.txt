Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit
I called up the Uber but then I pulled out the Range
That's that nigga
Yeah that's that nigga
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
After blunt after blunt after, hey
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
I've been waitin' on this all day
Nigga pass that shit, yeah
Nigga pass that shit
A bad bitch rollin' up some good
Light it up and hand me it
Pull up in somethin' that go skrrt
Feel like Ray J for the purp
Come and let me hit it first
I'ma pass it if it's some gas
I'ma pull up, might forget to ask
Smokin' Ivory, passin' plenty tabs
Roll the 'Wood up so it can last
