[Intro]
(What thing is that?) Pressure. Changes everything. Some people, you squeeze them, they focus. others fold. You summon your talent at will? Can you deliver on deadline? Can you sleep at night? (When do we talk about money?) Money? hahaha, that’s the easy part
Money don’t sleep so I ain’t snoozin’
Your girl choosin’ maybe cause you losing
Feeling like Houdini levitating up
Make her dance is what the Benjamins do
