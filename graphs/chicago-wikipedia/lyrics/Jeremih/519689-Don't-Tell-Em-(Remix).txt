When this song come on do the ratchet
No cuffin’ here puff puff pass it
Ay, you know I’m from L.A
Uh, pretty face and a big butt
Told her toot it then I boot it like the World Cup
Waka
[Pre-Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Only is you got me feeling like this
Oh why, why, why, why, why?
Loving while grabbing the rhythm of your hips
That’s right, right, right, right, right

[Hook: Jeremih]
Rhythm is a dancer, I need a companion
Girl I guess that must be you
Body like the summer, fuck you like no other
Don’t you tell ‘em what we do
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em, you ain’t even
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even, you ain’t even even gotta tell ‘em
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won’t tell ‘em how you hit the ground with it
Girl you know I’m from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (in it)
Nobody take me out though
You got gifts bring ‘em down the South Pole
Marathon doll, I’m putting miles
Don’t you worry about it, I can work it out

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
Shawty from the back, met her in the A
Hit it at the ‘tel, never hit it where I stay, hah
You know I act the fool, Bobby Brown with it
James Brown with it
Young rich niggas
Pull up in the big ass yacht like no
Don’t tell ‘em, don’t tell ‘em
You ain’t even gotta tell ‘em
[Hook]
