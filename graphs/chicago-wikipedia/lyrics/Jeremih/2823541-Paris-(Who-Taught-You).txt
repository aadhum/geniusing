Who taught you how to buckle up when you ride it?
Like six flags in the bed, body rollercoast-
To suck a dick with peppermint
Who taught you that? Who taught you that?
How you walk with all that ass, you hauling all day
Who taught you that, huh?

Who taught you how to make them niggas beg for it?
Who taught you that, huh?

You so nasty, you so nasty, ayy

Dolla, I wanna ménage à trois
