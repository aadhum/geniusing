Baby let your hair down, let me set the mood right
Blend in with the stars, underneath the moon light
We can take it far, farther than we've ever gone
(or been)
There must be a magnet
Cuz physical attraction runs through our veins
and the cameras. We're never out of action
Is it just my 'magination spinnin' through my head?
Teach each other lessons over and again like (one, two, three)
Gotta keep you up until it's all done
I'll give it to you from my heart
Cause you got the kind of love one wishes upon a star
Don't tell me to go, cause I won't stop
Until the morning comes
Rays of sun, yeah
