Baby, ya break me, lets do it big like Vegas

Baby
I could really get to know you
Take my time and show you
Don’t tell anybody what we do
When I get lonely
Take me
To another place where I’ll be
Face to face, just you and me
With no rules, just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh, hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh
Just like you
I get lonely

Just like you
I get lonely too

I get lonely too ooh ooh
Hoo ooh hoh
