I thought I told yah... I'm a star
You see the ice... You see the cars
Flashy lights... Everywhere we are
Live the night... Like there's no tomorrow
I got money... I don't need the rings
I'm a pimp... I don't need a cane
Big bills Charlie.
You could keep the change
Now that I got the torch... I'm a keep the flame
I'm a keep my aim... Gotta make the big shots
In my linen suit... Louis V flip flops
Got a bad bitch... Her hair & nails tip top
Just before the stacks... I got rubber bands
Check my DNA
beaucoup
You're a Scorpio... Girl get over here
ballin'
I. I. I be. I be ballin'
You can catch me in the air. air
Especially at the end of the month
When it's just not an option
Cause everywhere I go it's...

F L A S H Y L I G H T S!
