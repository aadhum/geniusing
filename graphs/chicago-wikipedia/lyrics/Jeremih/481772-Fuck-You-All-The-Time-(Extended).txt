M.O.E.T
knock-kneed
God damn mommy your sticky icky icky
Got a nigga out here feeling picky icky icky
Don't let the time ticky icky icky
While I'm snapping off your bra and biting down your Vickie's
Getting real freaky and it's getting really frisky
Chanel say no, then she say go, up and down that pole, she go, go
kiss me like you miss me
Anything I want to is what she always tells me
