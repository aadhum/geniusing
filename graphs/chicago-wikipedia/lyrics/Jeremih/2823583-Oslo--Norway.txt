I need this money Frankie, yeah
Hook: Jeremih
I just threw a grip
Tell that bitch to strip
Henny, Tron we sip
I got a bitch so bad I put her ass in time out
Just want some head in a comfortable bed, it's that simple
That's gon' pop that pussy, that's gon' pop that pussy
That's gon' pop, I'm startin' to feel like Uncle Luke and them
Give her thug's passion, feel like 2Pac, I'm a outlaw
south park
She got Nicki hips
Henny, Tron we sip
