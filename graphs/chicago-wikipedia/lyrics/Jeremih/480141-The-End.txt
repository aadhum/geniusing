I don’t wanna wait
Your body won’t leave me alone
Yeah you know we grown
We both ain’t tryna be alone
Show me where you got all that from, tonight
Wanna go somewhere, babe
Make you feel like a little vaycay
Girl you know you wanna be my bay, bay
Now she say she wanna have my baby
We still lighted with my crew, go
Nothing beat me and you so, low
I just really wanna see your drop top
You just want a G all in your G-spot
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
She go in there, she go in there
Man shit getting crazy, hazy
With a Blasian bad bitch up in Vegas
Bitch amaze me
Shake it, I want you shake it, cause it pays you
Shoutout to your momma ‘cause she made you
I ain’t tryna be alone
I ain’t tryna go home
I ain’t never seen her before, tonight
Everything that you do
Honestly I’m down with for sure
Tell me where you going after, tonight
Wanna go somewhere, babe
Make you feel like a little vaycay
Girl you know you wanna be my bay, bay
Now she say she wanna have my baby
We still lighted with my crew, go
Nothing beat me and you so, low
I just really wanna see your drop top
You just want a G all in your G-spot

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
I don’t understand why these niggas gotta hate (what’s up)
What's a rat to the cat, mongoose to a snake
You know that they looking for you, you just sit your ass and wait
But don’t do none of that looking like your ass on static
Pussy nigga you don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke
He don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke
Chi-Town, blow, now we major
You don’t want smoke
You don’t want smoke
