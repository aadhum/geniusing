Let me get them
Ooh's them Ahh's (x4)
Let me get them
Ohh's them Ahh's (x3)
Then we wake up in the morning we can do it again
Baby girl you better stop making this here an obstacle
Then we'll make raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops... fallin on our heads
Raindrops (ohhh)
Raindrops
Round 2... no hesitation
Cause once I'm up... there's more precipitation
Shorty I can take it slow then I might just hit the gas
It's so wet on this trip I might just slip and crash
She remains my heart was living pain free
And I got more chips then Vegas
Plus I got more whips the Avis
A queen go to be crowned
