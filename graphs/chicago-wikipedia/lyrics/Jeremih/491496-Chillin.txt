See the sun going down
It's kind of late
Tell me what you want, what you saw
On the day when you fell in love
When I'm in the buildin'
Feel like it's the beginnin'
Feel like I made a killin'
Swear I just made a killin'
You know I be chillin'
You know I be chillin'
Feel like I'm off a pill and
My whip ain't got no ceilin'
There goes another day
Here comes another million
Guess
me for so
