Want me to push up on it 'fore she know when I'm all on it
We get the party goin liquor flowin this is fire
50 and Jeremih number one there's nothing higher
(Won't you go and) Get it, get it, work it, work it (I see you baby)
Work it work it, down, down (Just put it down on me)
Get it, get it, work it, work it (Put it down on)
Break it, break it, down
Ok she headed to the dancefloor and she slowly start to poppin it
Somethin like my wrist piece everybody got to watchin it
Girl you got that secret treasure I'm 'gon put a lock on it
Don't care what they say I would be stupid to be not on it
Ms. Vicky,
heard you got that
sticky
Let's go and take nine shots we'll just call it 50
And I'm gonna licky licky
licky 'til her hicky
Have-have-have her river runnin' keep you gunnin' 'til you empty
Oh you look so sweet
What you work at Bally's? Look at your physique
Girl you are a beauty well-well I am a beast
They must have been trippin' to have let me off a leash
I love the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime, why you lookin' lonely?
Go buy another round and it's all on me
As long as I'm around put it down on me
Just put it down on me put it down on me
Down-down on me put it down on me
Don't throw it off the mound show me how It's 'gon be
Girl all I really want is you down on me, put it down on me
System's thumpin party jumpin
shorty she's a perfect ten
She rock her hips then roll her hips, then drop it down like it's nothin
She shaped just like an hour glass, see how fast an hour passed
Time flies when I'm on that ass but I won't put your shit on blast
