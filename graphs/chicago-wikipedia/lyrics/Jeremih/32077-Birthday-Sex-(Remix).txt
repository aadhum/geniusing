Huuh, it's your birthday so you know how we get it down
I'm gonna put it on you till the neighbor's here the sound
We could get it poppin' on the livingroom floor
Untill I hear you, holla baby give me more
Se it's your birthday so I'm happy to a blashed
Lick up on it magic box between your thighs
Tell your girlfriend you came to the cafe
Put your butt up on me like I was a ashtray
Huuh, see you asked around and heard I was a G'
And I don't pay for sexy, I get it for free
But it's your birthday so I am willin' to pay
You feelin'so freaky I wanna touch you
I heard you're from Dc, now I wanna fuck you
I'm here with my whole team, we gonna shake you down
Me and the street fam'we don't play around
First I'm gonna take a dive into the water, deep untill I know I
Pleased that body body ahoo
Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you up off your feet
And make you wanna tell somebody body' how I do
