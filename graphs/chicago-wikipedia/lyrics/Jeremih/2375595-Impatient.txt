Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Cup full, yeah I'm on
Poured up, she ready
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no
Still dippin' through the city with the top down
Know your city, what you're used to
Know I ain't exactly what you're used to
Know you're prolly worried what I'm used to
I don't blame you, what you s'posed do?
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no
Told her ‘Bae I’m ready. Bae I want it
I can go all the way until the mornin'
We could do all different type of positions
I'ma have you suckin' on my fingers while I hit it
From the back, you like it like that
I know 50 different ways to make you climax
You got the flavored oil, girl you nasty
Rubbin' lotion on you, you ain't even ashy
Tree leaf, a little O
You know I'm faded
Heart shape and I love that
Come here, I'm down with it
I, can't
I can't keep my eyes off your face
Let alone talk 'bout your body
I've been waiting for so long
Girl you just don't know, no
