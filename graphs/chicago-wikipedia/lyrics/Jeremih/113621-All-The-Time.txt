M-O-Ë-T
Facetime when I'm gone, she give me dome from a distance
and we got trees, so Mary go around
Gotta know I ate it, she so sweet, now and later
I put on a magnum, like a gold medal
And if it’s sweet then I’mma eat it ‘til I get sugar diabetes
I’m a blood and she anemic, we perfect
Tunechi,
While I’m snappin’ off your bra, and bitin’ on your Vickie's
