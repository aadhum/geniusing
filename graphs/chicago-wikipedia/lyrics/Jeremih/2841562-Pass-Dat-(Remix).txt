Pass it like a test she cheated on
My bitch badder than Rashida Jones
Damn near bad as Nia Long when she leave it on
You don't let them niggas baby sit
If you the baby hitter, sit around it
I'm bickin', I'm back, I'm boolin', I'm drinkin' some grapes
I hopped out the Balmain and then I put on some Bape
[Verse 4: The Weeknd]
If you're not with me, I feel bad for your team
You should cut them off, you can follow your dreams
Now the tour is done, I'mma have me some fun
Mix up that Xan with a kickstand
Strip club lit up cause the wristbands
Your friends so low if you ain't my dog
Don't talk to mine if you ain't my dog
Mulsanne on deck with the emblem
I own that shit, no rental, yee
We fuck up, we fuck up, we fuck up, we fuck up the road
My niggas come quick with that lambo, that's the shit
Yeah that's the shit
Cup after cup, gotta double that up
Feel like Ray J for the purp
Come and let me hit it first
