[Intro: French Montana]
Don't panic, nigga don't panic
Don't panic, nigga don't panic

[Chorus: French Montana]
Shawty fell in love with a hustler
Man I took her from a buster
Niggas keep talking like they know something
I slide on your bitch like she on something
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started nigga don't panic
Real niggas getting cake, watch the fake niggas hate
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started nigga don't panic
Don't panic, don't panic, we just getting started nigga don't panic
[Chorus]

[Verse 2: French Montana]
I won’t let up, sipping that Ciroc amaretto
Real bitches gon’ wait on me, fake bitches gon’ skate on me
Real bitches getting cake, fake bitches gon’ hate
She a model on the Gram, getting swallowed was the plan
This young thug need four bitches
Take her to the crib take no pictures
Ass fat, let me get up on it
Bounce back early in the morning

[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Okay, don't panic, I see you popping that pussy
I'm tryna lick on the cookie, I'm eating through the panties
In and out that booty, ham sandwich
Young, new killer, bitch, you nigga old like BlackPlanet
Strapped up, pistol with the bandanas
Extended clip, gotta hide it from the damn cameras
Man, I'm only smoking Cali kush
When I'm on the plane, they got your bitch rolling the blunts, I call it high standards
Chucks with my lokes on
Pretty girls, tell 'em ugly bitches, "Go home"
You know, they coming for the money and the real niggas
You know, these thirsty ass thots need a meal ticket
[Chorus]
