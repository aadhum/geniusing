I know you like it on the bed
You know I like it when it bounce
And when I'm pulling your hair
I be pulling tracks out
Love fiend, I know what it's about
Baby I know what you want and I'mma work it out
Oh yeah
Spontaneous, love-making like we're famous
Earth shaking, and we're faded
I got a whole new plan for you baby
Sex-rated
Let's stay and turn off the phone
It's just you and me girl
Don't tell nobody that you're home
That's how it's supposed to be girl
Ride me like you're coming home
You ain't never gotta leave girl
Let's go until we can't go no mo
No concept of time, I'm too focused
Too many places baby we can do it, let a nigga know if you're open
Spontaneous, love-making like we're famous
Earth shaking, and we're faded
I got a whole new plan for you baby
Sex-rated
Baby you know I can do you like nobody else
I be swimming in it like Michael Phelps
Come with me and see bigger things
The kind of things you only see in dreams
Yo, I beat it up like a punching bag
Give me one night, I bet you be running back
'Til you can't feel your legs turn you into a paraplegic
