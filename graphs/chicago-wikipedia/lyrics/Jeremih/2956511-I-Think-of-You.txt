I gave you the best that you ever had
Say you on my plate, girl, you so delicious
Wake up in the morn', you was gone
I miss every minute
I take plenty chances
My love for you is bigger than a mansion
for?
All I wanted was love, babe
I wish everyday was your day off
Goin' hard every night like it's the playoffs
You give me the energy, I like to play off
Tell me is the feelin' mutual or am I way off?
Pour your heart out, baby, I won't let it spill
I know the ones before me probably said they never will
You layin' all over me 'cause you understand me
