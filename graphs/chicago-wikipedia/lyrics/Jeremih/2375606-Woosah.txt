When you put that ass on my face
Feel like I'm 'bout to drown
And no help is around
I ain't worried about no other bitch you got me
Use them lips you know I love you, kiss my body
Way you throw it when you on all four, my goddie
Can you do it on the dick I didn't know, remind me
Slip and slide you know that's how you get around me
Speed it up I see you want to test my 'Rarri
