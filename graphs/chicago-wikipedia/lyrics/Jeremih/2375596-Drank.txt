Pardon my behavior
I'll apologize later
Say sorry later
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, drank, drank
Said if you leave with me tonight
I won't judge you, no, no
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
You know who you dealing with
First time I couldn't ignore it baby
?
Just screamin', "Daddy, daddy" one time
Pardon my behavior
I'll apologize later
Say sorry later
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, drank, drank
Said if you leave with me tonight
I won't judge you, no, no
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
But all I know, know is I'm gon' love you down
DJ Khaled
"J just hold 'em down"
Can't help that pussy tastes like green apple Crown
Legs up, talkin' peaced up
If you ain't hear that from your own mind
You'd probably trip if you heard me
Pardon my behavior
I'll apologize later
Say sorry later
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, drank, drank
Said if you leave with me tonight
I won't judge you, no, no
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
Blame it on the drank, baby
