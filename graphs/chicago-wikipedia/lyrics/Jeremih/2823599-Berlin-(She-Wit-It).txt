all the way from Vincennes
We should really get involved in here, yeah
Do you mind if I get all in it, baby?
All that ass, oh my God
Like Magic City in my car
She feed me grapes, gives me massages
She be runnin' around in the latest
She got woosah first on her playlist
7-11, how she be open
Yeah, she say "you wit' it?"
Then oh, let's get it
Tell me that I'm the only one, oh, that can hit it
