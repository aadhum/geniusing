Well not actually, but we got the sample from...
(yeah well whatever, it's all crap to me)
I know, but this is different I'm gifted, and it's some phat shit

Yo, can I at least pop it in so we can find out?
(I said no! I don't allow that nigga shit in my house get a job)
Ok I catch your drift this shit is just my passion
(I don't give a fuck what it is, you put it in, and I'mma smash it)
(I said no that's why, don't even ask again
Keep it up and find yourself fucked up just like your black friends)
You ain't heard of OutKast? Then how you lived a rock riff
Yo, fuck you Helen Keller

Well what about the Sistine Chapel?
I don't get it (It's wrong cause you can go to jail you dipshit)
Oh, like they fed Christians to lions, how is this shit different?
