Since before I peeped the theory from the low end
Water deep three feet high and rising
like the coupe she keeps passing me by in
suicide to suicide
juice
They never remenisce
black sunday
black moon
Outcasted
so the setting of the sun beefed with its rising
brenda's baby
Clear blue skies
ain't the devil happy as fuck
For every rhyme that'd take flight from my soul just know
That there's at least 5 spitting behind it sitting from the writers of old
poor righteous teachings
the road to the riches
glam and the glitz
shut 'em down
got you open
KRS
paid in full
Rick the Rulers
Hip Hop hooray
the message
