Coward human got a gun, he's down to shoot it, run
Bow before his outward spouting power
And the rain sings like, I don't care
And the train howls like, I don't care
But where them thugs at, so other thugs know just who to bust at
Some dumb ass brats who buck at other thugs, but miss as much as tap
To cap a total stranger's rug rat
Waitin on the bus mad
Fuck cats actin adamant about thug ass philosophy
But oddly enough never changed a diaper or diaper wrapped colostomy
