Now we're swimming with the salmon to calamity's lake
With granite feet, shaped from vanity and grammy speech "thanks"
The late great planet E
Time's a lie, Yah's alive, why's it man that we praise?
Anchor hands and canvas feet
Like, damn if we say
Standing deep beneath the, deep between the span of these banks
It might take a Barbie chant to get the answer dj'ed
