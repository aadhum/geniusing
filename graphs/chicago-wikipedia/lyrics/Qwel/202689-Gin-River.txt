Pearl shivers on the shores of Gin River
Just searching for daddy alone, he’s a swimmer, he’s just late for dinner
Her shadow dances on the surface and rips into ripples
And scribbles off to find her daddy like calamity’s normal
They hiss, “This one’s on the house” then slither on her
She questions, “Have you seen daddy?” he say “Yeah, maybe
But your glass is half-empty and that’s a pity pretty baby.”
He remind her of her father, watch the water get faster
She fall in Gin River, love whoever want to catch her
Undertow tug the string on her heart
The river freezing her breath
Fighting the current, screaming deep to her neck
Calling for daddy, they keep bringing her drinks
Oh how she sings as she weeps
Tossed by the river, it’s that lingering stink
So many fathers with strangers’ faces and promises crooked
She just been looking so long she just forgot she was looking
