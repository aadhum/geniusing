G4 for sure,
we're goin' to war son
On his snide pride, lyin' with a smile and forked tongue
but here the fourth horse comes
Messianic demons meet in secret, we believe it aloud
Swingin' sickle at these anti-Christos keeping us down
Blingin' heathen at this bloody freaknik
Crowds of weekend warriors
but Meaty seeked, so we found
Never peace on this earth, reserved for sleep in the ground
Fallen singer
that fallen angel clipped, crippled and lame
Limpin' for sympathy, bitch-like, but his riddle's his name
Is that your eyes open high to the bloody horse soundin'?
If you ain't 'bout it 'bout it, you're about to get drowned, kid
With triple-six brow
Blazin', amazed at how this truth just sounds sick
