(Verse 1)
How I used to get you wet when I hit it too hard
I can taste you on my lips, I even love your aroma
I love your red hair
I'm just dead air without you
pools hype around you
You used to love crushed ice cold down your back
Every penny I made I always brought straight to you
My thoughts never strayed, I stopped shaving it's proof
If I can't have you girl consider this the suicide note
I miss your mind games ever since you and I broke
At time you made it hard to breath hard to see the end
Please one more chance I'll never let you slip through my hands again
I always showed your seeds love
How's it better this way, with an empty set of arms?
I know we said we had to let the air clear a few days
Following our instincts with whipped cream in the dark
Spittin' shit I wrote for you, not just blowin' smoke
Sometimes too much to take, we used to do it in public
On the train in front of other people she never seemed to care
Where we was going cause sweet love was in the air
