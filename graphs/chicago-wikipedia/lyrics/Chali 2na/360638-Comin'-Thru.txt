Welcome to Terrordome...
I'm your host the friendly neighborhood baritone
Vocals channel the spirits of old poets
I don't drink, my glass never will hold Moet
Similar to Paul Laurence Dunbar
From the crew you thought was just all chorus and one star
Now, I'm one-sixth of a clique that runs shit
A lot of details
Oh my body be scales
I'm from Ida B. Wells
Good Times
With a really deep militant mind like Michael Evans
Tuna fish that descended from Lake Michigan
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi'
I'm much more than just some backpack crap
Intelligent rap act or militant black cat
Killin' venomous platinum plaque macks
But forever spittin' relevant facts and that's that
Cadence is wild style like phase two
My skull's laced with titanium plates
That pass metal detections... yes
bleaker than Memphis
Buried Al Capone and house music was born
Robert Kelly performed and heavy styles was shown
I made hijra and settled miles from home
People should know me more than for
Just the verbal Herman Munster, what?
