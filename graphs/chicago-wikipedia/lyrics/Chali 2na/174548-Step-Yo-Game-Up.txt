Well it’s the late great fish again
From the great state underneath Lake Michigan
And I speak frigid anytime I think Jake’s listening
Get your arms wrapped up like some twisty ties
Keep it funky long as I can like imagine
Inside the passion I try to make it happen
So I don’t have to wear a ski mask and blast guns
Hot like we hit you in the face with the devil’s breath
But just in case that the level slips
Never fret, just pick up the pace like you never left
Yo clash [?] cause a black Columbine
Gotta push cause a lot of cats out of time
The poorest people make scratch by any method
If he desperate he can pull out the strap to send a message
