Lock shit DOWN!
We came to just do this for you
Sit back and just watch us bubble
We come with more heat than the sun do
Gorillas out of the concrete jungle
Yeah, of all secrets I'm the best kept
Making sure my first step is my best step
I watched my investments while the rest slept
And changed tools like the faders on the vest tecs
With a swisha full of kush and a towel under the door
You remember me as the tallest one of the four
Every time you come and check out your boy he -- lock shit DOWN!
Deliver a show horse with little or no force
Don't front, people killed off the joint, there's no choice
Huh, I'm running my mouthpiece
While you shall beef, screaming from your couch seat
We about heat and we come to -- lock shit DOWN!
Tool of a trouble setter
{?} bass sick as Barney Rumble's sweater
And I'm blowing like the coldest winter, Chicago weather
Hey, while you sweeter than plain cinnamon
My lyric venom in your vein, now your brain haemorrhaging
If you think that I'm insane, I'm a plain citizen
People call me by my name, I remain disciplined
Hey, a wicked sentence in a vicious blend
Has more wealth than the wallets of the richest men
The love of the art form, not just a dividence
My stomach growling like Lions, it's understandable
Quicker than a Cheetah run up on a Caribou
Mister International
out of pocket
