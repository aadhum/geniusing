Hustle hard for them bucks nigga
Thats a must nigga
Paint up a picture
Of me and the squad still on the block
Before it went wrong
And Kobe wasn't gone and Joc was still home
Man, I remember
[Verse 2]
I'll give up the money, fuck the fame, all the jewels
All the hoes, all the clothes and all the shoes
Just bring my niggas back
They hate me prolly
But they only gonna make Mally come catch a body
Man, RIP my homies, gotta get this money
SQUAD, RIP the L's
Free the L's why you niggas wanna be the L's
No Limit MB, bitch we the L's
RIP White Folks, I can't see a L
Pull up on the oppas, pose' to be there and they hidin'
