I come from the slums, nun but murder drugs
But all my people fuck with this so I show I love back
And matter fact my nigga birthday just was yesterday
You Kobe cowards on the block feel like it was yesterday
30 minutes, getting the water hard at school late at hour
150 Dream Team, I'm tryna run that bitch like Hova
Now when I'm in a plane looking down tryna see what state we over
