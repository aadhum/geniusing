7-9, Roc Block, that's where I reside
Seen a lot of niggas die, but I'm not traumatized
A lot of niggas actin' funny now cause I'm getting money now
Just cause all my niggas countin' hundreds now, niggas wanna come around
I don't fuck with niggas, only with my 10 year niggas, them No Limit niggas
And we ain't fuckin' with the jakes
Snatch us up, bet you we don't remember shit
