Intro(Lets get it! Fazo Land
Gotta eat by any means, for that green I was with it
Money come around now I'm tryin to raid the town
So my clips scrape the ground
Buck after buck, 1 leave em stuck 2 leave em slumped Throw the pumps in the trunk
They know we got that drop, yall rocks playing double dutch
Stepped on concrete, washed out like laundry
Pharrow in the cut
Bitches always staring at me, trying to get a piece of something
And they can't get a piece of shit, still i make them eat the dick
I'll never be a stain
Pussy nigga should have never brought a knife to the fight
Bitch we grimy on the 9, we get reckless on the 8
No face, no case, The rats get the whole thang
Flip a ounce and cop a drop top whiter than cocaine
He shooting like D Gaines
Jamal on Muskegan posted up like Mutombo
Thrax packs for the low
If you front us for a dime, put some ether in his neck
Maintenace man hate the block, cause we always leave a mess
And they call us hotboyz, but we always leave em wet
And the ops don't come outside cause they always need a vest
