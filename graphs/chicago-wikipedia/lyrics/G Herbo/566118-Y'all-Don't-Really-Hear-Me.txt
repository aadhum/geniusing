3 shots fired and that's 3 kills
That's real rap, on 79th them real traps
In the dip with them real gats
I ain't talkin bout no lil gats
That ning ding like Lil Shaq
Like old bitches, we will clap
Ima boss, I ripped that
Caucasian I whip that
Thats why my wrist flex
White remy, I sip that
9 got me mix matched
My lift weights got kickback
Bitch niggas dont get that
Chit chat get a bitch wacked
Get low after that click clack
Got clips filled with them tic tacs
And .44's with them 6 packs
Roll up on him in a white van
Blowin shells out like sprite cans
And it's Ls over them fuck niggas
Every cent in my payroll I made that for Fazo!
Making niggas leave they hood
Call they ass some refugees
So im posted on the 8 with a 30 in my 9
Put a nigga on his ass if he come across the line
Let his mans meet the nickle if he tryna drop a dime
Make a nigga freeze up like my hamma stoppin time
Run up on his block with the mask, Rey Mysterio
Mac shots rip a nigga up now he cheerio
