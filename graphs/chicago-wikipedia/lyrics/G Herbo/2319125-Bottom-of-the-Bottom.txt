Ballin Like I'm Kobe the mixtape
150 dreamteam, man
From the bottom of the bottoms
It was nothing under me
Now I'm that nigga, everywhere I go and I'm who all the bitches wanna see
Who could ever picture me? When I was broke who ever mentioned me?
2010 you wasn't friends with me, now I'm hot you can't get bands with me
Trying to take the whole 150 overseas we gon' probably need a fleet
But when I think about it probably all my niggas felons
We gon probably need to sneak
I've been balling since I dropped Fazoland had Cannon referee
And these G Fazos go with everything, buy at least 3 pair a week
And you know for Kob we shoot 24s with 23s on our feet
No Giuseppe kicks or them Louis Vs cop a nice pair of wheats
Now  the judge hang us with 100 years, used to hang us by a tree
I was born in the trap tryna stay up out the penitentiary
Cuz living ain't cheap tell me how this the land of the free
(Cuz living ain't cheap how the fuck is this the land of the free)
79 and Essex
Baking soda, yolaâ€”that's the recipe
Now I got them keys and I got them ps
1400 now they 17, That's on everything
I'm so M.O.B. that's over everything
With them killers, we 100 deep
Up on Essex
Now  the judge hang us with 100 years, used to hang us by a tree
