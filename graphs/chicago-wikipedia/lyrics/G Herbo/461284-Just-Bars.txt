This ain't no 4 Minutes Of Hell, Pt. 4, none of that
No Limit MB, 150 Rock Block shit man
Ball Like I'm Kobe, the mixtape
My squad, you know?
Bitch I’m still the hottest, I’m just being honest
Turn me up a notch, I’m on supersonic
I ain’t been asleep, bitch it's 8 o clock
When you finish noddin’ me meet me at the top
Leanin' off the drop, Mally got the Glock
Everywhere I go, Robin, Truey'd be up
Louis, Gucci’d up, all the newest stuff
While my diamond dancing and my robins glancin'
Pocket full of Jacksons, shoebox full of Franklins
Smoking on Jamaican, all my clothes be stinkin’
I know niggas hatin', choppas like the Haitians
I ain’t single-chasin’, I’m just bein’ patient
Listen what I’m saying, I get in my zone
Offer me a milli I won’t even take it
Where I’m from man, mill look like a nigga made it
Feelin’ like a nigga made it
And I be ridin’ down Lake Shore, gettin’ faded
Dutchies, double cups, gettin’ wasted, thinking
Hottest, youngest in the fucking city
All the bitches wanna fuckin’ lick me
Cause I just left the Summer Jam with Nicki
And she just helped me book a couple shows
Hundred niggas and we got them poles
And they gon' unload, you better not come near me
I be in the streets, catch me over East
When you basic all the bitches complicatin'
When you getting money they start complimentin'
You get on my level, nigga now you pimpin’
Pillow talkin’ hoes, nigga now you trippin’
Coppin’ and I’m flippin
Rapping and I’m trapping, earning and I’m spending
Make a broke nigga learn to pay attention
You might go out snitchin', I'mma go No Limit
Everywhere he go you know his .44 wit him
I was off the lean, bro was off a bean
Leave a murder scene, we ain’t heard a thing
Call my phone for verses like emergencies
Swagger-jacking, they committing burglaries
I’m a trend setter, I'll set it off
Desert Eagle same one as Queen Latifah
It's a bitch, press her, I'll let it off
Every day I leave the crib and sacrifice
I might go to prison, I might die tonight
'Till that day I’m livin’, nah, I ain’t scared
Lotta niggas bitches, don’t know how to fight
Leave ‘em wit' a right, bro go get the pipe
All my niggas hustle, barely gettin’ by
Stressin', smokin’ ounces barely gettin’ high
Out here seen a lotta real niggas die
Prolly reason why a nigga get so high
Get so high feel like I live in the sky
I'm so high I could tell all my niggas hi
Wish I had a chance to tell my niggas bye
Hate to see my fam and my niggas cry
Bodies dropping Summer to the Winter time
Lotta niggas never see the finish line
I will never ever leave my brothers
He got on but he forgot his homies
Know you brothers we all need each other
If I got it then you got it homie
Believe that
Drop 'em,' where the weed at?
150 dream team, all my shooters heat check
And we all on top, I ain’t even peaked yet, huh
