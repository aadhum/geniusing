Nigga lookin' for us we out there in that gangway man
78th man
Come get it
Roc-block
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt
Cut some niggas from the circle, they was on some other shit
My dogs was trained to go, they was blowing out they mother shit
Or should I say ya brotherhood, either way my brothers good

If a nigga try to send shoots then his forehead what I aim at
And a nigga got that straight drop, all they wanna know is where the cane at?
Have my young niggas hit and kick doors, all they wanna know is where the stain at?
Run up in a nigga trap house with the macs out, where the keys at?
I get all the cash I can take up
And if I'm missing money then I make up
But if I don't eat it's a drought in the street
So early in the morning I'm out with this heat
Like a day with LeBron, bitch I'm out with the Heat
I ain't in the house, bitch I'm out you can see
Let a bitch nigga act 'bout it to me
Have my young goon punch 'em in the mouth 'til he sleep
Ridin' round town with the strap in the seat
Run into a opp put the Glock to his cheek
