I just been feeling different lately man
I been pouring eighths everyday and popping bottles in the stu and shit
Seen so much in my life I got demons in me I don't fight I just keep em inside
Growing up I had poor nigga dreams just to be on TV shooting threes throwing dimes
Then I learned wait oh no no nigga dreams will chase yours, what I just spent on drink was a dime
Neims
Used to sleep in the streets didn't see OG for weeks and won't come back until I get dollar signs
