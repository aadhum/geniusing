But Kobe told me " fuck the opps, you gotta watch homies."
I'm the type to keep it cool and just watch them slowly
I learned how to read niggas when I was a shorty
I feel like Robert Horry, I can't end up a story
Catch me on E.A that's Fazoland
black .45 Glock like Fazo had
And my respect still go to you, I got your name lit
And ever since you left we still been on the same shit
Get that paper stacking, I can't hustle backwards
These niggas more in love with stunting than they love the money
These hoes the reason why one day you gone wake up with nothing(give her up)
I put in hours with no sleep trying to get it
That wasn't for shit but for my wrist to shine
Grew up in the hood all my life, seen a lot of shit
Hollow tips, fly out that Tre pound make his body flip
