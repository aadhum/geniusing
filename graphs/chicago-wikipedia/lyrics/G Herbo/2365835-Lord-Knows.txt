Came up from the bottom off my own road
Cause a rich nigga bout to put some shit in the air
Metro Boomin on the track man, it's fuckin' golden
Came up from the bottom off my own road
It's me, Joey, and Metro Boomin
Me, Joey, and Metro boolin'
You ain't cutting the check fuck your two cents
Studio full of backwoods, we boofin'
And my homies keep askin' for cups of the lean, I don't wanna share
Came up from the bottom off my own road
