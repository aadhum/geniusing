This is dirty Sprite right here man like Future handed me this motherfucker.
Since Instagram say everybody ballers and shot callers
Why the world not a better place?
I tell myself even though I got a lot of niggas
But name a nigga filthy rich around a bunch of niggas
Don't get me wrong I love my niggas and I trust my niggas
But add up all my savages man that's a quick 50
Get rich or die tryin' way before I hit 50
And then reach out to all my niggas like "get rich with me"
And every nigga that's my mans got to understand
If I say yes every time my bands ain't gonna stand a chance
But all my niggas hustlers, they givin' grams out
So customers the only people with they hands out
Broke niggas, we ain't those, ay
Act up, get a face hole
All my niggas want is face shots
They can't wait to get the jakes hot
And I'm sippin' straight drop
Since 15 I've been leaned off codeine
And years later, shit I ain't stopped
Big G Herbo fresh as fuck, yeah all my fits at least a stack
Niggas think it's only rap
30 clips in every strap
They wanna go? I'm ready
Like the levies, they try and wet me
Plus I'm leanin' heavy
So they think it's easy to catch me
Better think again
Lost my homie and it still ain't really sinkin' in
I just pray we link again
