Ran real, lil nigga you ain't right
And I hold my own when I keep my pole
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga ain't nobody making you
Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
Aiming slugs with my niggas we tryna suffer end
No choice but to deal
G Herbo get you a deal
Herbo I didn't grow up with a butler in LA with my Uncle Phil
No I was out of Chiraq posted up doin' drugs duckin' hollows
Lost so many niggas don't know how to feel
You niggas don't know how to feel
Ran real, lil nigga you ain't right
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga ain't nobody making you
Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
I don't fuck with you fuck niggas
When you see me in the street don't say nothin' to me
I got forty on me, I keep it on me
Don't run up on me
Wicked shit, can’t control how I think
And I been on the streets all my life
And I seen my day one niggas die in front of me
When the cops question me I don’t know, I just blink
type
you getting exposed
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga ain't nobody making you
Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
