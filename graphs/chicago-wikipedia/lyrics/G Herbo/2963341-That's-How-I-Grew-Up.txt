OG ain't let me on Essex until I grew up
When G Fazo died in 2010 I just ain't give a fuck
'Member me and Manski on the phone an hour teein' up
Fourteen we was young as fuck all ready to fuck shit up
Lil Roc died Rellski turned himself in for a year or sum
Four blocks can't switch, four blocks that way
Four blocks up four blocks back
We run our shit and the opps
