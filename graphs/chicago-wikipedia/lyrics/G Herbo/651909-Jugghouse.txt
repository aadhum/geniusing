It's G Herbo, nigga welcome to the jugghouse
Kush, lean, pills, rocks at the jugghouse
Tecs, pumps, macs, Glocks at the jugghouse
First off ain't no rap business at the jugghouse
Talk numbers, cop chickens at the jugghouse
And you know the jugghouse in the hood, bitch
Don't get your life took tryna' steal some lil' shit
AK's in here nigga, fuck that lil' shit
And give 'em a couple bands, ask 'em for that good shit
Got so many felonies in the jugghouse
It's a couple hunnid P's in the jugghouse
Got them Z's and them G's in the jugghouse
My trap niggas understand, that's that jugg talk
Deck my jugghouse out like it's a townhouse
And that bitch pouring drink like I'm from down south
loud
Keep it lowkey, bitch I got that brown dope
And my jugghouse just might be around your way
Got my jugghouse doing 20 thou' a day
Fuck that school diploma shit, bitch I done found a way
I serve my city cause I get my shit from out of state, nigga
