Big G Herbo, I must say I came a long way
'Member posted on the 8 Block and that hallway
Hustlin' we serving nicks might get six for the dub
Now I need 15 for a show plus my stick in the club
We hit your club 150 deep 150 guns
We got your hoe in the passenger but I'm not smashing her
She just know I want the top
verywhere I go know I tote the Glock
Never signed me deal I was out in the field
Over east looking for opps
And my homies ain't never cashed out on a grill
But they had a mouth full of rocks
Niggas fighting that drama and ain't take a deal
Free Crado, Free James and Free Gill
When I get it my mood I feel like Deuce Bigalow
Hop out G Fazo
Now that's going up on a Tuesday
