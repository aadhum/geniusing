Givenchy
I don't know the difference
I forgot what I spent on it
I'm from Chiraq, but my belt is from Italy
All these 100's, these 50's, these 20's add up til I count me a million
All these 100's, these 50's, these 20's add up til I count me a million
Never thought I'd see the day I go from State to State and I fuck all these hoes on my way
Gotta get this money cuz the opps ain't dead yet
But they always gon be broke and bummy
And that ain't nun funny
Thats why I keep this tech cuz niggas ain't never gon get nothing from me
HANNN!
I be up on the block that's named after Roc
Where Lil Mally tote 50 and 60 clips
Free my big broski Joc, when he touch on the block its a party
So line up a bitch for him
These niggas is bitches
They snakes and they fakes and they leechers
