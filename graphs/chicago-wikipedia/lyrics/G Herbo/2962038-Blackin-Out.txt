I heard you got your chain snatched then you snitched on a nigga
So you can't go to your hood cause you switched on your niggas
I got niggas in the prison you can ask them how they living
If they tell you that they eating everyday like thanksgiving
Heard a lil bitch 'round town said she know me steady asking 'round
Bump into her shopping how you know me bitch, you blacking out
