Oh my god, what is this? An L beat?
Eyyy
G Herbo. NLMB. 150 dream team. 150 rock block. Ballin like im Kobe
You already know what it is man. We the gang
Real eastside
Motherfuckin 79th and Essex
From Stony to Rainbow if you ask me goddamn it
Eastside you already know, look
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Buncha niggas that came up with me
Either missing them or they got sentences
free my bro shorty
4
like my blood
Fighting first degree murder with witnesses
Sometimes i get high and i think about what my life would be if i didn't go get this shit
If i dropped out of school and just sat on my ass and depended on niggas to get me shit
But you know that's not me that ain't nothing like me thats why niggas say they dont like me
I'm 19 and if i want to see 21 I know I gotta stay with my heat
told me stay away from the east
Lost my nigga rock on the 9, Pistol got hit on the 9
Lost Kobe right there on the 9, lost G Fazo right there on the 9
Fresh off a plane and I'm straight on the 9
I'm from where young niggas turn into killers because there ain't anything better to be
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Except for the time when i got shot
And that time I was on the block
But you know we was tottin them jocks
Rock block bitch you know how we rock
I'm thinkin the opps called the cops
Cuze right before that we got stopped
Of course all the slammers got tossed
And that shit happened on the next block
But anyways that type of shit happening anyday them people listening anyway
Niggas thinkin my lifestyle is cool
If I could would have stayed in school anyday
Niggas say they going to kill me, I'm not afraid
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Where I witnessed all those killings at
Where I left all of my feelings at
Still be in the same hood
Post up flame woods on the (Eastside)
