Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got them things in this bitch, things in this bitch
No you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get changed in this bitch, gang in this bitch
I see the green like the Packers
You swear that you diggin' a fashion
They see the way we be cashin'
Mason Margiela so nasty
They know what I keep on my feet
G-Fazos don't even ask me
When is your new tape gone drop?
She pissin' me off steady askin'
That's why my suitbox full of rolls
That's why I ain't trippin' on hoes
Still spend a stack on my clothes
And we on MTV
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
rockin
I only smoke out of pillows at oats
1800, a fifth of my clothes
Alexander McQueen all black
But I don't shit with them O's
You know shorty been EBK, so I don't do shit by the code
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Now that I'm out then I kick the bitch out
So with your Uber outside
I can't see you haters, I'm Stevie
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
Gang in this bitch, gang in this bitch
And we got things in this bitch, things in this bitch
But you cannot hang in this bitch, hang in this bitch
You get stained in this bitch, gang in this bitch
