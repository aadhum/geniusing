Look man, Ball Like I'm Kobe the mixtape coming soon man
Take me way back, way way back
Back to 87th Rink with the wave caps
Back to 72nd street that's where I played at
But 79 essex block where I was made at
East side, only side where I was raised at
Lost G Fazo in 2010 the rest was history
And ever since its been "murder all my enemies"
And ever since it's been "never show no sympathy"
But back to basics, you want that bank just hit me up my nigga
Smoking OG to the face I'm high as fuck my nigga
You know G Herbo keep some codeine in his cup my nigga
Roll up to my show we got 4 FNs in the trunk my nigga
And we got them slammers in the club
Marley
Maskey
He was out on 25 but he tryna make another bail
When I was 17 I seen my first 100 racks
I turned 18 seen it again and blew that 100 back
But now I'm wiser bitch I'm master making money stack
I'm tryna win a grammy I got fo' n dem out there sellin' crack
Big bucks my bro, he got it for the lo
Fuck the law they tryna send a nigga up the road
Passing out conspiracies they snatch me up bitch I don't know I don't know
Free my nigga Crazy James,
shout out my big bro perfect 8
Free Lil Merch and wet em up see shorty n them be duckin treys
Roll around with all my ice on me
I got 24 for Kobe and this pipe on me
They gon drop a dime or kill you for a dollar
And I'm ridin' round tryna ease the pain
Smoking on dutches drink a ace of lean
High speedin' and I'm switching lanes
Tired of talkin Ballin Like I'm Kobe on the way
Ballin Like I'm Kobe on the mixtape
Coming real soon man
