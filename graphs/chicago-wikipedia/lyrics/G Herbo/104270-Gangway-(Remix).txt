[Hook: Lil Herb]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way, but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
We trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway
[Bridge: Lil Herb]
Them niggas from that gangway'll put in work
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
If you try to hit us up, we gone come and hit you first
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt
[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case
And I be in that gangway, fuck nigga coolin' where it ain't safe
Out here in this gangway, my niggas wildin', boy, we don't play
That's how we rock in that gangway
I'm falling back while she give me brain
Get jammed up, just don't mention names
Keep my circle tight cause I don't fuck with lames
And I be in that gangway, where them gangs stay
Catch a body it's nothing, I bond out then I beat the case
[Hook]
I gotta have money like fiends to the crack
I keep the iron on me, ion reach for the Gat
Wake up gotta hit the streets with the Gat
I can never lack, go to sleep with the Gat
If ion got it on me you should reach for the strap
Lil Herb takin off, put the East on my back
[Hook]
