I said I wasn't gonna do no more 4 Minutes Of Hell's, man
This gotta be it though, this the last one
I'm from the jungle, lions, apes and gorillas,  lions the police
Fuck the system, man, we going back to racism, nigga
Look, the department suffer fake-ism, nigga
Black police try not to notice, like they ain't killing niggas and hate killing niggas
Niggas got their kid starving for some fucking J's
I be feeling like Phil Jackson, all these fucking plays
I been stressing, feel like I'm a couple days from insane
Pourin' up that purple happiness, it give me energy
Sip your happiness, forget your problems; that's the remedy
Sippin' Activis straight out the bottle, shit's so good to me
I be leanin', I be smoking, poppin' beans then I be rollin'
Hop in steamers and we rollin, hop in Beamers and we rollin'
Pull up on your block with glizzies and them beams and we be blowin'
Got a lot of niggas gone that I been knowin' since we was shorties
That alone just made me stronger, got my chrome though I ain't worried, boy
Posted on that curb, boy, early off the syrup, boy
Chill, if you don't know me, give a fuck 'bout what you heard, boy
33 up in the clip like I play with that Bird, boy
And niggas know that Lil Bibby my bro, got the shit for the low on the birds, boy
Real nigga shit, we ten year niggas, bitch, so imagine the numbers  for Herb, boy
And we go ham every month on the first, junky walk up and just empty her purse
Donâ€™t work with feelings, my money come first
And no, I'm not a hypocrite so therefore, I don't got to a church
God still with me even though I'm out here doing my dirt
It's a lot of times when I know I coulda been threw in a hearse
So I'm dropping 4s in my soda every time I'm through with a verse
Please do not try to act crazy my nigga cause rugers'll burst
If it was still slavery, I know the mastas' a hang me
Cause I only respect my momma and granny and aunties
I'm just a young nigga, from the 'go finna blow
And I'm still in the streets, so you know I will take blow for a show
Just let me know, as long as don't nobody search at the door, cause you know how we roll
If anyone try to act like they want smoke, then the club will be closed
No Limit's don't play around, all they know blow
Like they play with they nose
And they taking them souls
