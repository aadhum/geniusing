150 Roc Block Man
R.I.P. them niggas
Welcome to Fazoland coming soon
Just be patient
I know that's what ya'll been waiting for
Let's Get It!
Free them niggas
Look I wake up every morning with the same state of mind
Bitch I'm running to this money
Let the lames wait in line
Now I'm cashing
Riding Astons
Went from sitting in the station
But I'm up now
All the neighborhood hoes wanna fuck now
I can't let chain me up like a chump now
Taught me get rich cause you can't beat this
Gotta stay afloat niggas getting seasick
I had to earn my stripes coulda went sweet
We dream of sunny days
But it rain and snow in my city
Them boys be feeling anger
Can't just be hood on hood
Them boys be killing strangers
When it's cold in the game
Niggas don't know your name
Have you posted on the block
Giving blows in the rain
Niggas want Herb man that's why I keep a strap
But the Lord coulda took me today
Off the Po' up leaning so hard I could fall
Codeine
Sipping lean
Purple sprite
V12 fast as shit
Something long on my hip
Big pole nigga
live
Leave a nigga right there on the block where I'm at
Run upon us with the chance you ain't blow that
Ask me why I start rapping do they hear me?
But this shit ain't only rap cause it's in me
We ain't worried 'bout your stack we got 50's
Put No Limit on my back for the city
