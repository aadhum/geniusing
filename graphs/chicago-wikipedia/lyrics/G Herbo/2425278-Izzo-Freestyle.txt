Aye, It's G Herbo
You already know man
Y'all gotta name me one of the greatest after this one, look
Used to look at the P'O's.
Run down Essex with Vito
Now I'm trio, 3 tapes working on 3 mo'
It's getting easy. Bully rap niggas like Deebo
Fucking they hoes and they know that's why they hate me fo'
Short temper, Danny Devito
That's why I'm coolin'. Stopped leaning, rolling the B tho'
Backwood fever. Posto is my B.O
I miss leaning so much I been thinking about starting over
And I'm from the struggle.
Tho' I got dough it's hardly over
Gotta keep the toaster. Niggas think they can fuck me over
Catch me unloaded, pumped open, slumped over
Even though I miss them, ain't time to link with the fallen soldiers
Used to freestyle right on the Izz-eight
A verse 10k but I might take 8 if you strizzaight
Ready for whatever got mom and sis out the wizzay
H to the E-R, B to the Izz-O
H to the E-R, B to the Izz-O
H to the E-R, B to the Izz-O
H to the E-R, B to the Izz-O
