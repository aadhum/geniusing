But you can't judge that young man just by what he doing
You don't understand the circumstances, how he group up
He ain't never had a father, watched his momma toot up
I came up with them hot boys, everybody knew us
Can't trust a soul cause for that cash yo niggas turn to Judas
I'm telling you the truth, my nigga, cause I really do this
They murdered Roc and ever since the street shit just been into me
And for Kobe Squad it's fuck the opps, kill all my enemies
To ease the pain I pour up eights of lean and pints of Hennessy
