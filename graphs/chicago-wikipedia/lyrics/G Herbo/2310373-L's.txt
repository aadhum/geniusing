Haaa, G-Herbo, humble beast nigga. RIP all my niggas man
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
By 16 I'm cool with crooks and lettin' ratchets off
But back to story, me? I was just a shorty
See stayed in the slums, two parent home
But moms that's who was close to me
God was with me, jumped straight in that water, it ain't drown me
Love and live
your life
Make it lavish long
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Long live G-Fazo, Vito, Cheeko, C-Mo, Pistol, Kobe, Rock
Blizz, Richie, white folks, cracks, playboy, yeah my broski
Capo
The herd is real, the couple of names I didn't say I'm gone and stop
And damn Cap, we was just ridin' through the town
Smokin' out the pound
They don't understand my struggle
They don't care what I've been through
Kobe they don't know me and you was on the block
Up tweakin' all night right before they hit you
And your moms still calls all the time
Said she wanna hear the tape soon as I get through
And she know what my shit gone do
So she don's mind waiting till a nigga get through
All this shit on my mind and I'm only 19
Can't believe how a nigga get through
2013 songs I ain't ever even drop man
And me and Cap got some hot shit too
'Member bein' in the stu' all day
At the hood all night on some hot shit too
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
