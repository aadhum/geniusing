Goin' hard for my niggas that's all I got
Man whatever mine is yours that's all I got
And all I know is the hood that's all I got
That's on everything I love that's all I got
No I don't play about my mom she all I got
Yes I will kill you bout my brothers they all I got
No we don't talk to undercovers that's all I got
I'm either rappin' or i'm trappin' that's all I got
Young nigga always on that gang bang shit
Bag it up, slang piff, different day same shit
This fame shit came quick, but I can't switch
All my whips are tinted, and all my niggas winnin'
Yeah, you could tell the difference, i'm the realest in it
Don't make me call them killers get you gone in a minute
You know we keep that tool fam, please don't front your move fam
How you on that news cam, you shoulda stayed in school fam
That 30 gets you two grams now, they dreamin' bout a new Lam
And I, walk around with a few grand, everybody got 2 hands
She gon' fuck cause she know we them niggas
My niggas know I won't fold on em, see the opps then roll on em
Judge offers you two years and you told on em?
No I won't never leave my brothers they all I got
Seen my 10 year nigga Kobe die right before my eyes
And I miss my bro so i'm rollin' up swishers
And i'm pourin' up a 4 right now
And you told me bro you gotta watch these niggas
They're tryna come around you now
150 killers in the lane with me
In the same city Crazy James with me
Betta not run up on me he gon' bang semis
Slay the game my man bitch I play to win
I won't never change, all the change I spend
I know niggas when they left the hood
They ain't bring a dollar back
