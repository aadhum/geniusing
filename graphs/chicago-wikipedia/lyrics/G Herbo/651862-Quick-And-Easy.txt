All my life I had to fight, that's why I sip the purple
Smoking OG, tryna get to me some Oprah money
Young nigga don't put nothing but family over money
But ain't that funny how your family fuck you over money?
I spit that real shit, ain't no exaggerations or nothing
I been through it, I get through it,
I remember momma mad at me
She found out I was smoking weed
She never thought I'd get from over east to overseas
But I gotta stay in the states cause I'm still fighting cases
No hater, you can't bring me down but yeah, I see you tryin'
Gillie
Bruce
All my brothers still my brothers, good or bad, right or wrong
It's this bitch named Karma and she mean as fuck
You do enough dirt and watch, the score gon' even up
It's G Herbo, I'm the hottest, I'm just being honest
I swear I say that shit so much that I can't even stop it
