[Intro]
Yeah I know, yeah I know
Used to post on the 8-block, I was dead broke and they missed that, yeah I know
They ain't believe, thought I wasn't gon' be shit, be rich, yeah I know
Never gave me shit, got it all on my own, nigga G shit, yeah I know
I smoke me 2-3 to the dome soon as I'm alone
Just thinkin' bout my life I'm happy that I made it home
Cause Lord knows I've been doin' wrong out there all day long
But Lord knows that I'm just tryna put all of my people on
Why you couldn't just have your chrome on that day? Man I miss you dawg
Know we down here rockin' out, no talkin', you know you my dawg
Yeah you was my nigga and they ain't know you like I knew you dawg
Matter of fact most of these niggas really ain't know you at all
Niggas out here talkin' runnin' they mouth like you wouldn't shoot it off
Like you wasn't out ridin' round with that torch tryna get
No Limit that score
Like you wasn't out five pipes
In that Porsche through the opps, niggas just bored
Might as well lay it out there on the table now since you ain't here no more
I lost my bro right before my tape was ou
Made a way out some shit then fucked around and made a habit
Stayed focus then I made it happen
Even through Chiraq I be ridin' round crazy
Ratchets, got me wishin' that I stayed in Cali
hit
