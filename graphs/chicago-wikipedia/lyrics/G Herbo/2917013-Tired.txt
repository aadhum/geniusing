They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I ain't tryna go out like that, how the whole city run they mouth like that
Got a .40 cocked back, hollow tip magazine, yeah I leave out the house like that
Getting tired of everybody putting stress on me, fuck around and relapse right back
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
Tired of being around my homies dying, seen too many homicides
Kobe's last breath right before my eye
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I said if you wanna get ahead sometimes you gotta go with doubt you feel me?
