I'm so hot nigga
I'm so high nigga
G Herbo, I'm some hot nigga
Before I started rap I used to pop niggas
Maskey told me "Lil bro chill out cause you got hitters"
Get this money and we gon' be at the top with you
But you still can catch be up on Essex block nigga
We No Limit, that's 150, we got all the bitches
Lil Herb don't rap beef, nigga blow somethin'
And you might catch me by my lonely, I'mma keep it on me
Check the news, I heard somebody went to sleep for Kobe
And I'm leaning right now, bitch, I'm sipping codein
I been the same, I been gangbanging since I been a shorty
I been fucking grown bitches since I been a shorty
Run through that check like last month forgot I spent a sawdy
I'm 18 and I don't give a fuck about a deal
People ask me all the time, "You on the block for real?"
Sometimes I stay up in the crib cause fo' n 'em down to drill
And bitch, I'm always in the field, Roc Block where you find me
15 hundreds in my jeans, all my jewelry shinin'
Met some of them niggas and free all my niggas doing time
Matter fact free G Gills
He doing 20 in the feds cause he didn't squeal
Free Bruce, free Breezy ho
Free Slick and Crazy James, they some demons ho
Vito City, that's the team low
Pistol gang, yeah, we keep them hoes
Glizzies with them 30s and them beams low
Only got a couple minutes, take a couple flizzicks
All my niggas, we be running bitches like a relay
Thumbing through these twenties, fifties, hundreds
This shit ain't nothing, man, I'm still a youngin'
We got aim, don't get banged, you a fuckin' target
Kobe Squad, that's what we are
Six forties riding round, we in 3 cars
Flipping through they set, where them niggas at?
Caught a body last night, I'on have no time for that
And bro n 'dem still lurking, still creeping ho
Off lean, they off xans but they ain't sleeping though
Tryna' catch another body like a week ago
Forgot about that other body, we been drinking ho
Leaning ho, all I sip is codeine lil ho
Get my dicked sucked for Kobe while I drink a 4
And if you tryna' catch feelings then you tweakin' ho
