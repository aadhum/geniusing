This the windy city
We got windy semis
My team gotta see me shine so they coming with me
This money relax my mind like a ibuprofen
The trap is not a clubhouse
But nigga I be pushin that
So im out here making moves
Niggas plottin I can watch em
Body language giving clues
And they only make me angry
Like they want to make the news
You a shooter, talk is cheap
That's a statement you should prove
