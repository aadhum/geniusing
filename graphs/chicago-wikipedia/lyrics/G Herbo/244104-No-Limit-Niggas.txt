Im a no limit nigga
That's my motha fucking gang
Act tough get hit up
Get laid down then picked up
I be riding in my new thang
Listening to my old shit
Catch a nigga lackin'
I'ma feed his ass the whole clip
You don't wanna see Lil Bibby in a mask
Hopped out broad day and bust a nickel on yo ass
No Limit the team we got shooters like the mavericks
Gotta have a lot cause I ain't really never had shit
all my niggas hittas man
Go into the booth and just change like superman
Cock off me some thousands, you go in a coffin
I be on the block where you watch for under-covers
Running with the cannon do some damage, rest in peace
