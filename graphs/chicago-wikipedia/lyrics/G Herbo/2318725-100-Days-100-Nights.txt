100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
I gotta get my money right
It's hard growin' up in the struggle
Apartment buildings, low budget, I turned nothin' to somethin'
My mama lived with her mother, I grew up with my cousins
Lil nigga with big attitude, I'm gon' do what I gotta do
You don't know how good it feels it to throw my mom's a stack or 2
right back on that avenue
Spent years on that avenue, shed tears on that avenue
Sometimes I think I can just blink out this crazy dream
But reality it really ain't easy as I make it seem
Say Kobe, without you in these streets feel like I'm lost, my nigga
Shed soo many tears, make me feel weak, but I ain't soft, my nigga
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
I gotta get my money right
We ignorant, we immigrants, we murders, we prisoners
We burglars, we hustlers, you start it off, we finish it
know it's all bad, but he's all well
I swear
I'll only buck you down
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
100 days, 200 nights
I gotta get my money right
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
I gotta get my money right
