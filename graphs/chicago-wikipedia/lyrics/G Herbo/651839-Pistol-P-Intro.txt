[Intro: News Clip]
I'm that same nigga from that gangway tryna' kill shit
I wanna buy my mom a bigger home, put my niggas on and be still rich
You don't know nothing about that cause you a fuck nigga, I do real shit
If you in the streets got to watch niggas shooting Glocks with you, they a still snitch
Fuck niggas, I don't fuck with niggas
All my niggas know what's up
RIP my niggas, it won't never be the same
Young nigga
I came from the bottom, didn't ask nobody for anything
I grinded my way to the top and no, I don't owe no nigga anything
Weapon is on me for all of my enemies
