I'm broke man that's Ludacris I stunt so much I can go and buy you some shit
Mixtape in the making and I got some old shit as well as my newest shit
Nobody fucking with Herb I'm the best if I rap bout stupid shit
R.I.P C-mo and Peewee I just lost the guys to some stupid shit
The opps started scoring they must be getting lucky I swear all they do is miss
In the field ain't no lackin' and maxi a savage be safe cause he packin'
He gon' drop ya just as fast as them Migos be sayin' Versace
Lil Mallys gon' pop 'em,
And then we not stoppin', puttin' bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies
