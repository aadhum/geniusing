I came from the bottom that's why I stunt
Might go broke, ion give a fuck
Catch me in the club might throw a few bucks
Still throwin my set, that's where I'm from
I ain't worried bout nun, rollin up the blunt
Foreign whips all summer, ridin tinted, gettin blunted
And they all different colors, so you never see me comin
