'Member when I used to skip school, hit the block instead?
Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to slang under cameras like "Fuck the feds"
Hustle hard, we was stackin' every buck we had
In that field, 24 but we was duckin' lead
Bullets flyin' close range and they was lucky legs
Young niggas, dumb niggas, we ain't listen, had to learn
Killed my homies, now we grievin', load the heaters, let 'em burn
Gotta keep it, I don't know when it's my turn
So I'm ridin' through my hood, and I'm grippin' on it firm
.40 burst, hit the dirt, call a hearse, get a shirt
And the hood ain't see me lately, I'm like, "Y'all gon' get this work"
Niggas diss about me crazy, all that shit gon' get 'em murked
Don't do that
Found out where you hang out and have my shooters come through there
'Member I ain't have no gear, now I can't think what to wear
Used to tote them Dillingers, man how'd I get to here?
Now I'm signin' signatures and fuckin' bitches everywhere

Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to slang under cameras like "Fuck the feds"
And I'm a product of screamin'
And got a lot just off the top if it's the topic of demons
We talkin' weed cause I need it,
niggas faded and deep
If you need a fade then you get it,
the rain ready to make you go inside
Shoulder cold, he hold the 9,
see now they're suckin' dick
Taught me to stuff the Swish,
papi just up and dipped
Tight grip on the shit that I'm drownin' in
Can't step in my momma crib without counselin'
Dip, and my face on the kicks to the south of me
Let me say you're lookin' out, but I know you got it out for me
