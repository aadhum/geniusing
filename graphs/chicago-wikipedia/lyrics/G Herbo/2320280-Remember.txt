Remember me? Yeah I came from nothing
Stayed humble on my grind, stuck to it, now I wake up stunting
Cause I'ma already gonna die by the system, So why abide by the system
I prefer a 1-4 over the county morgue
And I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm 19 years going on 39
Young niggas don't listen just load up their pistols and stuff for them bitches that front how they living
with diamonds
150 dream team man
