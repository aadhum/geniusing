I know...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
NLMB, never leave my brothers man
Day 1 niggas, no new niggas in my ass, ten year shit
Real shit nigga
I'm a young black male dropped out
Worth a couple hundred thou ass nigga
Walk and you can smell me before I come around ass nigga
Cause I'm a leanin' ass, loud ass, rollin' out the pound ass nigga
And I got it from the mud
Took hard work to run them bands up so we fuck it all for fun
And G-Fazo would be proud of me so I fuck it all for 1's
Robins full of Hunds
buy crushes, fantas, dutches, swishers with my ones
80 dollar cups
But I'm through with that shit, tryna give it up
Yeah I fell in love
'Member saying I could never get enough
