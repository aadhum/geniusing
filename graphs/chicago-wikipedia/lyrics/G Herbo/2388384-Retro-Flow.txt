Ayye, ayye, 150 Dream Team, huh
splash brothers with me, scorin' shit
enormounis
I never lied even back when I was broke, these other rappers act C.B.4. shit
little shit
Shit ridiculous, used to shop at corner stores with fifty cents, probably died trying not to mention it
I had beef up in my hood like Fifty Cent, but I ain't ever have to make a many man
Know my death was wanted bad,  by many man, so you know I gotta keep it with me then
Forty glizzy with me, come and get me then, kill a nigga
Hollows in the forty-five, X.D., beam on the side of it
I can't trust these hoes, see yo house, put niggas right on it
Fuck that bitch in a hotel, kick her out, I put my life on it
I ain't saying nobody can get me but I see suspicion, I'm right on it
I get high and think of all them nights when I was serving
What the fuck up with the world, everybody savage
Nobody wanna be no doctors, all the shorties get clapped at
Ain't nobody going to college, all of the shorties on SnapChat
