G Herbo, young nigga been through it all man, everything under the sun man. I do this shit for everybody that come from the struggle man, the gutter, what I come from man. That can relate to my struggle and everything I've been through and what I put in to get to where I'm at. Cause this shit for who it for
Roaches, rats, and apartments
Mama smoking, babies starving
Pistols loaded, discharging
I grew up in all of it
Nobody role models, everybody alcoholics
The shorties either gang banging or they basketballing
Don't even mask up no more, these lil niggas brainless
armor flaming
Become everything I'm not
(?)
still
lakeside kill us for white folks
(?)
S
Fourth grade I was tryna be Ivo', shooting ball, playing round
My city know, I ain't even gotta talk
Pull up, hop out, white chalk
And a real street nigga took a loss
(?)
The murder capital, everyday welcome to Chiraq
Born and raised, homicide on the morning day
