My hunger is equal to my struggle
I came from nothin'
Grindin' then I made it to somethin'
The age of a youngin'
Started hangin' and bangin' and hustlin
Exchangin' the customs
To make it in this dangerous jungle
In a treacherous war
People dying, nobody crying
All the shit that I saw
You expect me to sit on the porch?
Every moment is yours
Freeze up and you fall by the torch where I'm from
Homicides on a Sunday in the city I'm from
Young nigga, always hanging wit them older guys
We was bangin', slangin' all the white
But we ain't Oberweis
Fantasizing, tryna be that trap nigga
Can't get to the money
We too busy tryna clap niggas
Standing on that block, where my mama told me
"Boy don't got right there"
I used to post up, talk shit and tote guns
While we smoke blunts
We knew the price if we gon' live this life
But I'm tryna make a way for every one of us to come up
When the sun rise I roll a philly up, and load the semi up
By 9 o'clock  I'm drinkin' double cups and gettin' paper cuts
We savin' up, sittin' on this money
Now it's raisin' us. We trained to buss
You can run dog, that's what this laser for
I think I need to, take a breather
Plus I got all this guap on me
But way before the flex you still could catch me
On that block out east
But I won't stop, I can't stop
Gotta go hard, till my rate drop
Spittin' all this fire make my face hot
Now I can't wait till my tape drop
And I'm still up on the 8 Block
Late night me and J. Dot
Better think twice for you ride past
Let the 9 blast now the Jakes hot
Smoke told me, "Bro it ain't no let ups"
She suckin' dick and I just met her
She hope I don't neglect her
And she know I don't respect her
And I might forget my sweater
But never leave the house without Berettas
Still the same nigga from the gangway
Tryna flip a ounce into a Phantom
Catch me doing shows filling stands up
You know the gang turn the fans up
I be leanin' I can't stand up
And this bitch asked me why my jeans sag
Cause they tryna hold my bands up
Heard somebody wanna rob me
Well you bett' not give ya chance up
I just hope I don't get jammed up
I seen niggas get in jams and
They ain't even stay to pick they mans up
I seen niggas shakin' hands
Then make the same niggas put they hands up
I seen niggas changed gettin' change
Niggas that was cool since the sandbox
So I gotta keep my head up
16 and I got one head up
Gave my young niggas couple .38s
And some shells let em have fun
Young niggas spend a lot of cash
Cause growing up I never had none
I'm like, "Oh I gotta get me some"
Cause being broke wasn't any fun
We got choppers for everyone
Who want problems with anyone
I be tired of tryna tell y'all niggas
Where a nigga really comin' from
And why a nigga gotta go hard
Cause ion really come from nothin'
And I never been a runner up
Cause it ain't nobody runnin' us
And Lil Mally got that sit em down
If somebody ever runnin' up
Imma always bond them killas out
What'chu think I got them hunnids for?
Crazy James just knocked his sentence out
Yeah the state done let a menace out
I see lil niggas want some Twitter clout
But I ain't tryna put ya business out
