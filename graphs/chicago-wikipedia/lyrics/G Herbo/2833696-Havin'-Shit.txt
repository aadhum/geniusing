Niggas know that I been havin' shit
Know that I've been havin' shit
habit bitch
Niggas know that I've been savage bitch
Count up and count some more, it's never boring
had to be at least 7 years ago
At 14 we was out there on that savage shit
(Pasto)
15 racks in my Balmain you can see it poking
40 tuck so tight don't even look like I got it on me
I don't got nothing for no nigga I just got it on me
I'll pop a 65
And when I went broke, I saw my last
I dont know what to say
I didn't do no crying, got off my ass, ran up a 100K
I had that money running laps like I'm late
Rubber band up at my momma house
I don't have no fucking bank
I remember my sophomore high school teacher said what I couldn't make
She made like 24 a year, my Bezel 38 (BITCH!)
