Just a nigga off the block tryna chase them dollaz
You boys broke, I thank the lord I dont face them problems
Walk up in the shop on Stony, ill take the Robins
And I pray for any nigga that can't wait to rob me
Cuz I got that 30 on me, I can't wait to pop it
Fuck the Jakes, my money straight
Build a case and drop it
Lately I heard alotta niggas hate me, stop it
And lately niggas say they gonna erase me, stop it
You can catch me in the field
Everyday we clockin
You've been welcomed to Chiraq
Even the baby sparkin
And its killed or be killed here
Even the babies heartless
When shit get real my niggas drill
Everyday them hammers cock
Everyday they droppin
And niggas dead my broski Roc
So ain't no way we stoppin
Its Rocblock til the deathbed
We cookin his head
Still Free to G. Gill while he up in the feds
T-Slim on his way, been upstate for them years
Real niggas from the go, man just hold up ya head
And Joc did a long time for the wrong crime
So broski this summer for you and its all mine
And broski we coming for you when its yo time
Just know I got something for you I need more time
In the streets, fake niggas can't relate to that
Essex block, murder scene nigga
Where it's all about the green
You a trapper or a feen nigga
You can catch me with my team nigga
No Limit MB, smokin loud drinkin lean nigga
We take offense over here nigga
Either worry about ya mouth or better say what you mean nigga
30 in a ning-ding
Make a real scary scene, hollow tips, red beam nigga
Cash rule everything nigga
So I got choppers for the team
Yeah I pop alotta beans nigga
You can slide thru, tryna ride thru
We advise you, shells fly comin right behind you
But we ain't talkin to the jakes over here
If they grab you better not answer
What they asky you
Know that snitches get
These 40's out the 50 clip
Flame up if you get the shit
Niggas gettin caught wit bricks nd shit
Sayin the jury dismissed the shit
Nah, you ain't with the shit
Hand down to the snitchin shit
