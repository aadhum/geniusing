Used to ride the front of the bus now I'm in the back of the back
I met Kobe on the five, we was
Girbauds and spray painted shirts
Now big bro own one of mine
Think bout fonem all the time
WIth Chico and probably smoking dro
8 bucks for a pound of loud
Miss all my niggas, why talk about 'em?
Naw they ain't like us niggas bitch made
Lil nigga, big gun, that was Lil Gage
Fucked up, lil bro was lil sis age
Go jail like a (?) is what the hood say
Aim the Glock like PeeWee, tell the opp, "hello"
Hoodied up if we got to blow
RIP Alamo
79th Street raised me, some of my niggas since babies
No Limit crazy
