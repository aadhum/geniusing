I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I remember 16, told myself money was gon' do nothin' to me
I'ma get up a check and always be the same cause that shit wasn't nothin' to me
But my mama got bills and my sister 13 and they depend' on nothin' but me
So how the fuck money ain't nothin' to me when I know it ain't nothin' for free
And I come from the east ain't no love in the streets
Growin' up it wasn't nothin' to be
I was runnin' the streets, fell in love with the heat
Niggas never did nothin' to me
As a youngin' I grew up then broke in the hood with my niggas
And knew how to rap
Yeah they doubted me, said I was too in the streets, what I do? Run it up anyway
