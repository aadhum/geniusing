Told myself, "G Herbo fuck these bitches run it up"
Ain't no one man army, told my niggas run it up
If my mama told me one thing, that's to run it up
I ran it up, now all these bad bitches just wanna fuck
Money calling like la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Big old houses and three car garage, pull off, ha-ha-ha
Keep the hammers out in traffic, boy I hopped out, bla-bla-bla
I am not with that rapping boy, I be capping boy
keep my strap on cap, I'm clapping boy
Soon as I ran up that check bitch I bought choppers and cocaine
Soon as you ran up that check, you bought Givenchy and Balmain
These lil niggas is silly
They don't really hear me, they ain't tryna run up on mili
Now it's 200k when I come back from states, bout to link up with Phat Geez in Philly
I am not with that rapping boy, I be capping boy
heights
I can't get left at the light
go
