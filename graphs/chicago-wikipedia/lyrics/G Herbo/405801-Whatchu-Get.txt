Stay in that trap and work your wrist, you just might get rich
You think that work was Jesse White the way I make it flip
In the streets I learned some shit that I can't forget
Rule number 1 don't never snitch you know what they get
Rule number 2 worry about you, don't owe nobody shit
And remember this, what you see ain't always whatchu get
Imma tell you this what you see ain't always whatchu get
Cause I saw that light right before my eyes, but they ain't hit shit
Remember all them nights, totin' all them pipes to protect my life
Imma ride for the squad, even when it ain't right, to protect my stripes
Mad Max goin right from the block to the opps, now he right by mikes
And you know for Lil Roc we ain't never gon stop, till we all on top
Bout 200+ eyeballs on the block, and we all gotta watch
Lil shit on your instagram don't mean nothing bruh, is you balling or not?
