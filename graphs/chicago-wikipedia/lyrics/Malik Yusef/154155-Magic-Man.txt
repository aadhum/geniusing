Buhblaaoowww, are those the stars you wanted to see?
The magic man could make the roof disappear in every car in his fleet
You messing with this joker but you need a king
Cause he'll club anybody trying to jack his queen
I'mma call a spade a spade from the start
He gave you diamonds, should've gave you his heart, you see?
Then he, turned her eyes black and blue with the wave of his hand
Siegfried & Roy
sweet street magic like David Blaine
She said you ain't no Houdini, ahhhh I know I ain't
I am an artist that can help you escape
Voila!
I didn't have to tip her, she was into my bars
she let any dave cop a feel,
