I will not introduce you to Shawn Carter but I will help you meet Jehovah
And I don’t mean the CEO of Roc-A-Fella
But your girl is off to see me throw up the stone
So she leave with the stone
Ya’ll go home alone and
Beat off like a a capella
I hop on top of tracklists and tend to show my ass bitch
Grindin’, Ryan Sheckler
Since I signed to Kan', I'm Louis Vuitton Sean
Up in Benny Han Han eating all the wonton
Rosé rose over a little Chandon
Put her hands down my pants now she rocking Sean John
Are you not entertained?
