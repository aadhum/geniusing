Time flies in the Leer
So this is something that could help you raise your head like hello
And I know they don't wanna see me cooped up in a Benz
They'd rather see me cooped up these pens
Therefore I release the ink that's cooped up in these pens
And this is a declaration
That we'll be fair again
Especially to those Americans
Who were Americans, before there were Americans
They say we need a prophet that can touch on the topics
And make it hot as the tropics. Well you got it
