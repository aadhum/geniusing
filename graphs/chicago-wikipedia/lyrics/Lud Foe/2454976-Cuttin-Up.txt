mob
I just bought a fifth of Henny and I drunk it up
You say you want some smoke, nigga puff it up
we ride with them illegals tucked
see the cops then I'm kickin' dust
opp shit
Hollow bullets beatin' on your chest, chopper King Kong
I get that work, I bounce it back like a ping pong
I heard you be lackin' off that lean, get your snooze on
Get my cruise on, I'm a mack with some Trues on
She said she like my swag, I be cuttin' up
He can't hang with us cause he ain't cut enough
You don't want war with us, you ain't tough enough
She can tell I get money, I buy the whole bar
And if a nigga fuck with my bread, watch a body drop
I call all the shots, I got coke in all of the pots
