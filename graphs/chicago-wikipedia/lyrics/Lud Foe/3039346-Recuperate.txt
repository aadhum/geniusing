Know it's
Just bought a choppa, now I'm feenin' for a homicide
Flyest nigga livin', I give bitches butterflies
corners, come and pick my trash up
Made it rain in the club, hoes pickin' cash up
Brian Urlacher, bitch you know I got my sacks up
Four macs in this Q7, this a Mack truck
Big bitch do a split, drop it, bring it back up
Tote a strap, nigga, so don't get clapped, nigga
I ain't got time to box with you, I don't wanna scrap with you
while
I'm from out west, we don't go to kickbacks, nigga
She get lost with me, I know you want your bitch back, nigga
I'm ballin' hard, you can have her back, I'm tossin' her
Randy Mossin' her
Bussa nut on her and make her sister lick it off of her
I can't cuff that bitch, no I'm not a police officer
Got a lot of haters but the glizzies keep them off of us
Gucci, Louis denim, boy you still rockin' Hollister
Hit the mall with my dawgs and we buy a lot of stuff
If my brother shoot ya, I'ma shoot you, it's a lot of us
Shooter war vet 223 bullets chop you up
You ain't down to kill, what the fuck you got a strap for?
I fucked her and her friend, made that bitch call for backup
