You made this beat?
Outwest 290 shit nigga
Get your guns up, get your funds up
You on that opp shit, get mopstick bitch!
Aye, aye
I'll tell you one thing you shouldn't did was diss me
I just left your bitch and she already miss me
I just bought 1,000 red skullies, boy ain't shit cheap
Big heat for these lil niggas think they want beef
Thick bitch, stash a quarter brick in her buttcheek
Your mama might get touched if a fuck nigga touch me
I'm holding on these racks
I'm toting on this Mac
You holding on that bitch she's a rat, Ratatouille
Hit the Gucci store I walked out double G'd up
I give her knee pads so she don't scrape her knees up
I bought a chevy brougham, sat that bitch on 6s
Its not a joke, you will get smoked, like you was hella dope
I'm living lavish, I wasn't living like this 2 years ago
I can't even conceal the Glock cause its a mopstick
Think he the predator, I'm the janitor, get mopstick
The bottom my shoes are red, Christian Loubatin boys
Outwest 290 shit nigga
Young street nigga
Bitch get your guns up, get your funds up
You on that opp shit, get mopstick bitch!
