I'm coolin' with my shooters, we wildin', we young and ruthless
I'm from out west where we gang bang(gang bang)
We from the slums so we slang caine(slang cocaine)
The police can't stop us, let a fuck nigga try and rob us
And he gon' lose his life damn right, he gon' end up in a mid- life crisis
informant
watch me get Houdini like they never seen me
I got bitches sayin they love me and they never seen me
i rock my ice in public freezin' i think i'm anemic
I hit you with this chopper i leave you paraplegic
eye-ball the work, fuck a scale
Gold shower on a hoe like i'm R. Kell,
i get it straight off the boat i'm the cartel
X-pill
You don't wanna find out how that tec feel,
put this sword through yo face like i'm kill bill
i'm a hot nigga i ain't got no chill
Young street nigga give a fuck about a deal
this nigga say he want a feature that's a quarter mill
switchin' lanes in a rari i almost broke the wheel
i hit the club i make it rain like a fire drill
Red beam on your nose call ya Rudolph
i just want some top ain't no need to take yo clothes off
And since i'm getting money now i buy all the stores out
It's out west 290 you want smoke you get blowed down
