Since I'm blown let me flex this
If there's somethin on yo' mind recline and check this
So smooth not reckless
We can get high and ride from Chi to Texas
Give the game up since I came up
Pimp poetry I make you lighter than a feather in your Dobb hat
Bitchin to skins, saw that
Pull up my drawers Girbauds and doze to pros got called
By the po-po
Bond DeVille
Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you, oh babe
Can you smoke and ride
With a playa, like me, and you
With the way she was dressed she might as well
Had nuttin on your body bitch
Bags seized through Darnell
Heavy sacks and drop-tops
I, made my money on the DL
Cause a brother gonna floss in front of these females
Five double oh period double oh these suits
The Girbaud with the boots
Then I scoop, up the loot
Put my foot in motion, exits the sto' with my brand new gear
Getty shoe fresh Guess from head to toe
