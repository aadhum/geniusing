I wish I could fly
Away from here
Unto a place
For You and me
Relax ya mind (relax ya mind)
And I'll fulfill
Your fantasy
But I can't help it just to be me original po p-i-m-p
In many conversation my name was brought up
You need to check your homie but not tonight
You involved in something thats oh so right
nympho
Make a ma take a puff like indo
Layed back in the
while the wind blow
Little momma drink bel or hen-oh
