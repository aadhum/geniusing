Do you wanna smoke my B (ooooooh)
Never can't you take my G's
Approach you with a limp while I hit on the blunt
Meet me at the crib bout 2, stop frontin
This is
Do you wanna smoke my B's?
Never could you take my G's
Comin straight from the Windy
Now my nature is
I done seen your sexy walk on the Pharcyde
So don't be "Passin' Me By"
Henny,
