Double em' when I unlock the Glock
To pop open up six more C's with ease
Freeze a brother like a holocall
On the call to get the tip off to rip off the Adimin
To break a chip off the other men
In the land where the zombie again I mean its on again
Triple beam is my only friend
Damn man it's hard to breathe
Damn man it's hard to leave
So when you all deceased
Don't even guard your grill
You ain't hard to kill
Flip this bitch get rich
Closed caskets, drastic's
How I come on the mil shit
Cause on the real (shit)
Now I can stand on that like Nor
Cut em' in two till them all in fours
He empty all the tec's
Vision of a killin spree
Body left on the Kennedy E. wherever
He say AK carry AK spray two the midday
Two 9 double M y'all, if all fall
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six
I close his eyes with the middle of the index
Shoot him up with two tec's
Flip this bitch get rich (6 million ways to die)
Closed caskets, drastic's
How I come on the mil (You for real)
I'm head strong in the red zone
Killing niggas is a misery
Visualize putting heads in the guillotine
I'm gonna die
Cause a holocall
How you feel when you dealin' with a real g
[Hook: Repeat x2]

Six million ways to die. Choose one
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six (Picture this, Picture this)
We treat your neighborhood like Vietnam
Everywhere I step theres a dead body
Even though they got shit on my block party
When I drop bombs everyone dies
It's seems to me you are the nigga sworn to test my skills
And eliminating me will be impossible (Me, me)
Try to touch my body
You got to come through obstacles
That's when you will die instantly
The seven seals is open for the chosen as is spoken
Competitor take a glance at the predator never ever more (lil bitch)
6 million ways to die x8
6 million ways to die choose one x4
