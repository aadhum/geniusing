[Sample]
My world came to an end
And then you came back
I think you brought it back together
Now I know
There is no (there is no)
Way (there's no there is no way)
That I can go on without you baby
Hollerin' at a chick that could of been a actress
Right now her back is layin' on my mattress
Why your team pissed like urine
Only rock things made for a king
Tell me tell me it was the LV
So I you want a role model to call like Patra
Got his own business an entrepreneur
Desert Storm
Ladies and gentlemen. You is tunin' in to Do Or Die (thank you) Kanye West
Chi-town finest.
