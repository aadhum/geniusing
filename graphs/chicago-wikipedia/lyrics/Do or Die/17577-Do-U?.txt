Afterward we hit the Mo Mo Mo
I'm city sharp, buy the mink to the floor
Hair natural, never bought from the store
All in the mall buying Avirex
I can pick head but I'm a bad for a check
In the truck though, so I can hop in the Lex
Baby got back, but I'm trying to relax
Did you wanna ride in my car?
Do you? (Do you? Do you? Do you?)
Light the B if it's special
If it's that raw, to the chests with the Remy
Like a slug with your vest off
In the 5 double 0 for sho'
popped some Crissy in the tub
When I'm sipping on Hennessey and Hypnotic getting stuck
And I need a thug
To care for me while haters be attacking me
Backing me to a corner while a brother trying to get theirs
And I need a queen backing me while I'm running my faculty
Telling me I be lethal when I spit words
Hit herb..................
Hold it in, then blow it out
