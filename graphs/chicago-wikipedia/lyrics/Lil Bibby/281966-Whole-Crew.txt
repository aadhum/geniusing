And you know I like everything that make sense
If I wasn't rappin', I'll probably take bricks
I be in the Trap, yeah I work the late shift
My brother sip codeine like he stay sick
Glock got no safety, but I'm safe bitch
Shawty got good brain, don't waste it
Off lean, movin' slow like the Matrix
And I'm the man in different states bitch
And all my hoes, they thick
And I'm allergic to the fake shit
And my mama told me that I ain't shit
When the cops grabbed me I ain't say shit
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Yeah, my whole crew in the place bitch
Young niggas got tools, they'll drop shit
When you hit the mall, you don't never cop shit
Nah, I don't do that bop shit
And they know I had dimes like Stockton
These rap niggas broke, niggas ain't rich
I just tell it like it is on that 'Ye shit
Yeah, my whole crew gettin' off
Shorty goin' cause my whole clique ballin'
