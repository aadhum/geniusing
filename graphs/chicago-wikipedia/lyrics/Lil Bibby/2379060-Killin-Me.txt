Now shit's gettin' heavy on my shoulders
I keep it to myself, I promise I never show it
I tell myself nobody cares, bucks, just keep it goin'
It's like I'm dying inside but you would never know it
Gotta stay strong cause I got fam ridin' for me
Soldiers on the front line, I know they dyin' for me
Came through in the clutch I'm like that nigga Horry
For three
All these frenemies, man I can't let nobody close to me
Kind hearted, man I swear I always looked out
But niggas they forgettin', still have they hands stuck out
Say fuck 'em all, I'm gon' do this shit for me now
How I feel, I need a shrink on speed dial
Off the top, this might be my realest freestyle
Now bring the chorus in, I think it's time to leave now
It was jealousy that probably be the death of me
Now I don't leave the house without a Tec with me
Put her on the block list, bitch think she stressin' me
