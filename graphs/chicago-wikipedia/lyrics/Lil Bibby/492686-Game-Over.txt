150 Roc Block shit man
You know no niggas fucking with us man
I tried to tell niggas man, it's over
Game over shit
Keep it a 100 plus 50 with my niggas man
No Limit, 150, we them niggas, man
Herbo, Lil Bibby, we at it again
All I know is get money and stack it
In the trap Lil Bibby make the pack flip
Chopper hit 'em, make a nigga do a back flip
But they do it good, they can probably get a Grammy
Like Fredo, niggas bitches, what you need, panties?
Dirty Crush, Pacquiao knock me out, Manny
Bad bitch, 5'5, light brown candy
All my young niggas hitta's, I ain't talking Sammy
Baby .9 in the booth, yeah it come in handy
Love red bones but Iâ€™ll fuck Brandy
Tryna' creep on this niggas but I had a crammy
Got a .4-5, two Glock nines
Tryna' argue? I ain't got time
Pull up on a nigga by the stop sign
Slide the doors back then it's shots fired
It's Chiraq, this shit serious
Just bought a thirty clip for the SIG
I'll kill bitch and I'll kill her kids
It all depends what her nigga did
We're killa's, we don't show no sympathy
I lost my niggas, I can't feel a thing
Aw, they deep? Lil' bro go clear the scene
He saw the shots but ain't hear the beam
He saw the shots but ain't hear the beam
Beg my pardon, I been sipping lean
Red or purple, I don't sip the green
These niggas keep hating, I just feed off it
Fo' fo' war dog, tear the meat off
AR 15, tear his head off it
I don't pay no damn note, bitch I pay it off
Real black tints, I just hide in the whip
New M6, no miles on my shit
Can't waste no time with a bitch
Money coming, I'm just piling the shit
It keep coming now I can't get enough
Bitch suck me to death, now I can't get it up
My shooters on the line like Ginobli and stuff
off the Kobe I'm stuck
Free Crack 2, the mixtape
They like: "This another Play They Role!"
Used to weigh the grams, now they weigh the gold
Rob who, fill his face with holes
