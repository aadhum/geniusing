I'm Steph, Steph, Steph
I got aim Bitch I'm Steph, Steph, Steph
Long range Bitch I'm Steph
I was the champ in my spelling bee then I dropped out of high school and start selling weed
Are you a friend or a enemy?
I know they wanna get rid of me
Plotting on killing me
Do me like Kennedy
I know these haters not feeling me
I keep a 30 believe me
Al Capone in the flesh,
Steph Curry at his best
Jewish lawyers on retainer
