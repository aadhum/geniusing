Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Standing on the set, kush on my breath
Shooter to my left tryna earn some respect
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Light skin as shit but I'm known to use my fists
But then again
I'm feeling like 50 when he dropped "Many Men"
Only got myself, I don't trust any man
But the jewelry that I buy, I will not lose
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
Ooh child, things are gonna get easier
Ooh child, things will get brighter
