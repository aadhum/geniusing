They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Learned mathematics, from fucking with crack addicts
God stay with me but I never pray
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
