I said bitch I'm gon get money and that’s with or without you
Youngin doing your thing, you coming up, they gon doubt you
That’s why I pull up in this foreign just to stunt on these haters
Then I pull these racks out just to show that we made it
50 shot MAC, I’ll blow it at you
Bout to go insane, watch niggas switch up when you get famous
When you get a little money, watch shit changes
And I walk around my city like a big stain
Smack a bitch like Rick James
See I spit that crack, niggas on that hype shit
Cause they ain’t never ever heard shit like this
Say fuck a gun law, Imma carry my shit
I be judged by 12, you be carried by 6
Do it by myself, cause a nigga might snitch
Never leave a witness cause the shit might stink
Nigga telling on they dogs like a nigga Mike Vick
See I’m getting cake, got guns on our waist
And we riding with the K, in a high speed chase
Man if shit get real, then we shooting at the jakes
We made it [x5]
Nigga we made it
Bitch we made it
We made it
Yeah we made it
We made it
Gone
