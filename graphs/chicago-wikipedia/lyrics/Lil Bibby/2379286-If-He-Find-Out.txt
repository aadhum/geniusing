don't give a fuck, oh yeah
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah
If he finds out, if he finds out
(Fuck that nigga, ay, ay)
I don't give a fuck, no, yeah
I don't give a fuck, ay, ay
If he finds out, if he finds out
When I pulled up, he was pissed off
And I don't mean to get too explicit
But shorty know I get the juices drippin'
I don't really care if dude hit it
She say, "he ain't hittin' it like you hittin' it"
I can keep secrets
I love when you're deep in my tummy
Deep as the ocean, we're fucking and moaning like mummies
All I wanna know
Is how the fuck am I gonna get away with this one?
Cause I wouldn't be surprised if he strangled me
I swear kiss me here
lyin' to my man
Cheatin' in his bed, what if he finds out?
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
Fuckin' with your bitch
