Young Chop on the beat!
If it ain't about money I ain't tryna' talk
My chick called I cut the phone off cause I'm tired of talk
If it ain't about money I ain't tryna talk
My chick called I cut the phone off cause I'm tired of talk
Got goons with me they strapped up cause they ain't tryna' to talk
These nigga give me headaches I'm so tired of talkin'
I ain't politic with these fuck niggas I'm tired of talkin'
I hope niggas don't speak to me cause I'm tired of talkin'
I turn up then I leave I ain't tryna talk
I'm paper chasing you ain't Ben Frank I ain't tryna talk
Niggas sneak diss when I'm not around
I peep shit, I'm not a clown
Got a bad bitch she gon knock ya down
When I ride around
Hit the mall and spend 20k on my necklace
Swear to God I can't help this
Another 10k on my left wrist
Young niggas fucking hoes, tryna get cash
Kicking doors cause I need that quick fast
Lil bro put a nigga on the shit bad
Keep talking imma let the 4 grip fast
Call a nigga Jesse Owens cause that bitch fast
Your main chick in my foreign whip cause she tired of walkin'
You got a girl you ain't fucking, I'm tired of talkin'
You ain't talking money don't talk to me
Five for the verse, I don't talk for free
Got some young goons that'll spark for me
Please tell your girl quit calling me
Please don't talk when I'm in my zone
We strapped up if shit go wrong
30 shot clip in my chrome
Young nigga got a pocket full of bills
Came a long way from duckin' shots in the building
You don't want it from the shot cause I'm stealing
All my young boys got a pocket full of pills
Niggas I don't even know like "What's up?"
Niggas talk to much, shut the fuck up
I ain't worried bout a nigga tryna' touch us
We'll off em' no talking
My young boys don't like talking
Young goons they all bouta profit
