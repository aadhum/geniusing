[Hook x2]
We be doing hits
When we get off the shits
We ride on your block and get to lettin off clips
We be doing hits
We be doing hits
We got guns to pick, (yeah)
I just bought a Glock 9 with the rubber grip
Keep that in the whip, dirty Sprite I sip (sip)
whip
I work late nights so it's no sleep
And these broke niggas be so cheap
And every nigga that know me
Know, I will never ever go sleep!
Sellin dope ducking police
Young nigga riding foreign now
Cause niggas pay to hear me and bro speak
These niggas is so weak, and Iâ€™m so hot, they so not!
Niggas talking that gangsta shit
But I don't never see you on your block
Find out where you hiding at and
Go Masked up and run up in yo spot
Same nigga that got shot, and ain't do shit!
Feeling good buy a new whip
Knew I'm back when I was serving
Now I'm foreign car swerving
I got shooters at my service...
