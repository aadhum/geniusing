See an opp then we makin' a scene
Hundred shot,
Glock
You an opp if you not with the team
I just went copped a few Glocks with the beams
I just talked to 2Pac in a dream
Told me "keep grindin', keep doin' your thing"
Bitch I'm No Limit, don't play with my soldiers
cash
Don't fuck with witness unless they Jehovah
We want your block, we gone take this shit over
Young nigga get off the weight like I'm Oprah
They callin' me Bibby The Great
I just might pull on your block in a Wraith
I hang with the lions and apes
Dressed up in Bape, pipes on our waist
Come in your house for the safe
Send all your shooters my way
I go Tony Montana no scar on my face
I'm public enemy like I'm Osama
Worthless lil nigga, pops shoulda wore a condom
Cause a savage can't handle my conscious
VVS on my chest, my heart cold as ice
You a bitch like your girl, man y'all both alike
If the cops pull me over, I know the rights
Like you think you tough cause you on the pipe
Hollow tips all in the sig
I might have to smoke me a pig
Coppers been killin' them kids
I swear that this shit gettin serious
So please do not play with my niggas
I went to the store, bought some K's for my niggas
I make sure everything straight for my niggas
If money get low, rob a bank with my niggas
