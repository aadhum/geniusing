Young nigga spent every day up in the streets
I ain't for the beef, I was out here tryna eat
Used to walk around with eight grams in my briefs
Now I'm on planes, getting change overseas
Man if I get shot, is it Heaven for a G?
Heavy in the streets, lot of threats sent at me
So I ride around, MAC-11 on the seat
Made it out the streets, I'm a god, I'm a chief
Still ride around with my gun on my side
Get a nigga murked, let me think, what's your price?
Give my boys the word, they'll do the shit tonight
â€˜Cause I swore I'd be caught by the cops
Either that or probably get shot
Been around the world, now I see the bigger picture
Feeling like Hova, Biggie or Mystik
You just turned from nothing into something in they faces
Now them niggas plotting on your money, tryna take it
