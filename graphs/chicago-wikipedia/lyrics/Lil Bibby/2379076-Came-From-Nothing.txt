Went from trapping out of them bandos
To tryna grab that new Lambo
In the rap game but I ain't playing though
I'ma take it far as it can go
I done heard your tracks, I don't feel that shit
They talk that shit but I live that shit
Gotta copyright the flow â€˜cause they steal that shit
Boy you knowing damn well you ain't did that shit
Serving that white in the trenches
Watch for the cops and the snitches
Just killed the track, go and throw it in a hearse
shop
Play with me, you get popped, nigga
You ain't gotta push me, I ain't Pac, nigga
And I been in the field like I'm Ken Griffey
Lil young nigga, tryna get his fame up
Got a couple retweets, now he think he came up
I remember them nights that I laid on the flo'
I know that them fuck niggas hate it
But now my community gated
