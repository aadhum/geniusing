Nigga we ain’t worried bout nothing, boy
I’m a boss stacking all this money
My safe stay full of new hundreds
My trap house still doing numbers
Show you how to turn nothing into something
Money on my phone, so I told that bitch hold on
Put the business first, then see what the hoes on
Young nigga stunting, walking round with this gold on
I would flood the block but I ain't tryna get told on
Niggas dissing, acting like some women
Hey but we ain't really tripping cause we got some pots to piss in
Nigga we ain’t worried bout nothing, boy
When we pull up as the shit and go get your bitch’s attention
She wishing her and my dick could have a head on collision
They get permission from me, they gon turn her with no ignition
King,
double Styrofoam for the lean
And when I’m seen on the scene, it’s obscene
And a vert so clean, half a million dollar chain
Fuck with us, wreak havoc, bring terror
Nigga we ain’t worried bout nothing, boy
Wheat timbs nigga, we don’t do the Reebok
Nigga we ain’t worried bout nothing, boy
