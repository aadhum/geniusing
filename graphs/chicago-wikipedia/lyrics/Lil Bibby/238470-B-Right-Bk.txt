I put money over these bitches cus I'm all about that sack
I just hit a bitch from the back then I sprint right to them racks
Shooting dice in my hood musta lost bout' 10 stacks
I don't ask for shit back, nigga, I'll be right back
Say what? *click clack*
Feed his ass that mac
I'm gone off that pack
I'll be right back
Niggas talking smack, hold up
I'll be right back!
I move coke no zero
Keep that on the d-lo
Bibby I'm that negro
Got heat
From them d boys
30 clip in that gat,
machine guns go brrrattt
Make a nigga lay flat
Now he can't come back
You shoulda had yo strap
You snooze nigga you lose nigga
That's a body on my tool nigga
My nina she do niggas
You shoulda been a school nigga
Bibby I'm a cool nigga
Remember we used to fight and hit niggas
Baseball bats
Now we stay strapped and shoot at niggas
Baseball caps
I be in that field
Where niggas get killed
We do hits, no drills
put me somewhere next to Gill
Kick a door, I need cake
In the booth I go ape
I better eat for your sake
Or im eating stealing off yo plate
Spend it all on gats *click clack*
