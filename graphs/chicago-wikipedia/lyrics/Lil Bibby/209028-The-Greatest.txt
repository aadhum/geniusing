I can't trust a soul so i keep the 9 wit me
And we work hard, can't take no time off
Can't turn my grind off, i think my mind lost
So nigga talk shit gon let the 9 off
Get to bustin watch them niggas get to runnin
Im feelin grown man
Get up in the booth and turn ape like gohan
Bibby i be swagged out
Im yelling free CRACK the fiends thought i had a pass out
I smoke irine eyes blood red, no visine
Nigga you a customer and ima give it to em gotta serve my fiends
Kush strong but never mind me, and if you need something gotta run it by me
That 4 4 that long nose thats pippen
All this money im getting, i move weight no fitness
Im so ridiculous, no weatherman could predict this
See i told my wrist this
When i spit raps make em think 2Pac back i must be a descendant
Smoking loud no midget,
Bitch i need 8 digits, period, put me in the game and im killin
