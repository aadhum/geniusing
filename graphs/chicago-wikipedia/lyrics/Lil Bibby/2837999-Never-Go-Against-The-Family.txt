Lesson number one: Never go against the fam
These niggas will destroy you
But I don't trust 'em, I say fuck 'em
You not my cuz, you not my brother
That's why I show no love to these snitches
Show no love to these hoes
I ain't tripping off them niggas I know how this game goes
I do by myself, I don't need your help
I do by myself, I only trust myself
All of my niggas gorillas
Play and they might go bananas
Fuck niggas know that it's on me
I might as well blow 'fore they smoke me
I'm just gon' fuck her and ditch her
Niggas gon' say that they you bro
Niggas gon' they say that they love you
Then when you need 'em the most
These niggas turn into ghosts
Better not go to no jail
They ain't gonna send you no mail
They ain't got shit for you loyal
They ain't got shit on your bail
