Ya, some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
But some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
Look, all them homicides has a nigga traumatized
But niggas 13 totin' guns, they'll smoke yah
Now I'm about to open up, they ain't have no hope for us
I ain't ever seen Ye, he ain't ever showed us nothin'
Young nigga gettin' older, heart got a lot colder
Right from wrong, shit nobody never showed us
I might as well listen to this devil on my shoulders
I had a dream I was whippin' in the Rover
Then I chased the dream, got the cream
Out the hood by any means
Salt and pepper, hot sauce in my noodles
Mama workin', dinner time Toaster Strudels
Trained us to kill our own selves, niggas better wake up
Mama screamin' at me, "Who the fuck cash is this?"
Now I write my mama's check, I tell her, "Cash this in"
Remember havin' 50 cent to my name for lunch
A quarter juice and some hot flames
My homie could've been Jordan but he got changed
Yeah youngin' had hoop dreams, but I knew a few fiends
That I could serve, prolly get them Jordans and some new Js
The main objective was to make it out
By any means, if I find out where the plug stay I'm stakin' out
