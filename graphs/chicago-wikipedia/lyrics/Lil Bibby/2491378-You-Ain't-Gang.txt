In my pockets, all hundreds, run up on me, bitch I'm drummin'
I was thuggin' on the corner with my niggas, came from nothin'
Fuck these bitches, I don't trust 'em, I'm a dog, fuck her cousin
They like, "Goddamn Bibby why you still on that block shit?"
Get you shot quick 'round them niggas I don't rock with
I seen niggas turned Christian when they feel that hot shit
Give a fuck if you box well, I got hot shells
Drop Ls, pull up back to back and give your block hell
Pistol whip your kids
Niggas get in jam, start tellin' on their blood brother
Love my lil' brother cause he always keep it real with me
If it fall down, he gon' be right there to build with me
Right back in the field with me, robber, he gon' kill with me
And I'm eatin' steak now, but I'm with that beef shit
Love the ones you starve with, them the ones you eat with
I don't trust these bitches, only Nina who I sleep with
See you ridin' 'round flexin' and shit with all them guns, boy. Lord knows you got a license for every one of them bitches.
Stop flexin', boy. You ain't tryna catch nothin'.
If a nigga play with me, he gon' have to meet his god
And I'm still ridin' through the hood, grippin' on the steel
they know why I kept it hard
Fuck the police and the serge'
If they ask me 'bout a murder, I just tell 'em I was blind
Like my last name was Charles
Talkin' way before hip-hop, pounds in a Ziploc
White Shawn and Marley
I was shootin' dice, tryna come up on a big knot
You was in the class crackin' jokes like you Chris Rock
