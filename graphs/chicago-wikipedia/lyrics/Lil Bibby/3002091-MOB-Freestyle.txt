Say they let me in the club, through the back, with the strap
All these strippers on my dick because a youngin' got them racks
Hell yeah, I move the pack
Hell yeah, I keep a gat
Hell nah, I won't snitch

And they know I'm M.O.B
Put my money over chicks
Niggas got them hands out, so I told 'em "suck a dick"
Please do not
This sum cleaning you know whats happening

Pull up and pop at the shows
