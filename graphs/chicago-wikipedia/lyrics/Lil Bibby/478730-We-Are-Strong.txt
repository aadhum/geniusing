[Hook: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong
Nigga, you ain't talkin' money what the fuck you here for?
When I'm finna cop a crib somewhere by the rich folks
Long ass clip, know it got a lot of shots in 'em
Pussy ass rap niggas always got the cops with 'em
That's why I can't fuck with 'em, never put my trust in 'em
How they gone react when a nigga get to bustin'?
Couple shots fired, watch the niggas get to runnin'
Really said fuck 'em, this is not a rap song
Contract free, what a nigga trap on
Pray the Lord keep me safe from who I fuck without a rubber
Brother got murdered, I'll never have another friend
Stomach rumble learned to kill without a question in the jungle
Got it out the mud, they respect a nigga hustle
He be ready to flash out and you know, go with his move
I really don't feel right givin' no good advice cause I'm in the streets thugging
I can get killed or go to jail any day
Shit, but by any means, we gonna fucking eat
Aye Gates, where should I start with 'em?
I can tell these young boys ain't got no heart in 'em
Niggas funny, you don't even like to talk with 'em
(Me either but we gotta play it smart with 'em
Did it on my own, I don't need nobody help
I was on the block movin' P's by myself
Chasin' after cash, everything movin' fast
Gotta get it while you can cause you know it won't last
On the phone, in the kitchen, cookin' wearin' slabs
Me and Bibby in the building, life of the party
Know it's got a name but I don't know what to call it)
