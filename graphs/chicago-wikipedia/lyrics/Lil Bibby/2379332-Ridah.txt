I won't change, trap hard
Turn a quarter ounce to a whole thing
Ain't no shame with my game
Young nigga take a loss and don't complain
Street nigga, Glock-9, Tec-9
Keep with us, beef with us
My squad a bunch of lions in the jungle
Fuck nigga can't eat with us
Got dope, coke, kush, dro, for the low
Need somethin'? Let me know
I'm out of town in the stu'
Still trappin', fuck nigga just called broke
Let's make it happen, callin' plays, young Madden
Most wanted, Bin Laden
Young niggas come through
Try to run, red dot, real master
Got foreign cars, foreign clothes, foreign hoes
Extended clips, foreign poles
Real shit, real hittas, doin' hits
Murk niggas, never told
Got Mac-10s, ARs, AKs, FNs
It's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)
I pull up with Lil G, and G Slim, and Lil Squeak
Slide down on Lamron, Lil Reese throwin' up two threes
Young boss with the two T's
I stay countin' that blue cheese
Niggas said they gon' do me
So I ride around with a few heats
Been paranoid for like two weeks
In the van with that .223
Spent 30k on my neck bitch
Try to rob me? Gotta shoot me
Don't fuck around with no rap niggas
I post up with them crack dealers
Young niggas that jack niggas
And ride around and whack niggas
Still bumpin' that Illmatic in traffic
Got all eyes on me
Niggas act like they know me
Sit your five dollar ass down before I make change nigga
It's my ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider (my ambitions as a rider)
My ambitions as a rider, don't get fired up (don't get fired up)
