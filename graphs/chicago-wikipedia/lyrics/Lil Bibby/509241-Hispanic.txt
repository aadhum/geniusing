2 door with the roof it's panoramic
Money the root of evil but nigga that is my language
And if you ain't know my plug is Hispanic
My plug is Hispanic
My plug is Hispanic
I told you my money my language I know you can't understand it
Nigga I make it vanish you wan't it well you can have it
I got a Mexican plug, he from overseas, he fuck with the keys
He send 'em in 3's they front them to him, he front em to me
I get the work gone, you know how that go, my shit for the low
I trap hard even on Sundays
Bunch of young niggas bout gun play
They say I only end up one way
Like fuck it, shit, you gotta die one day
I don't go in till the work gone
So you might see me out with the same fit
Red beam on the Glock so I can't miss
And my plug fuck with me cause he know I make it vanish
