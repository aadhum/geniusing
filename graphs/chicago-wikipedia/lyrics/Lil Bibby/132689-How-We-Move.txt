Hunnid deep with the crew
That's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool
That's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school
That's how we move, that's how we move
Yeah, that's how we move
I'm a rap god, I trap hard
This shit ain't that hard
They act hard, let the mac spark
Turn niggas to track stars
It's no limit, I'm gon get it
Don't sneak diss on that squad
Fuck a bitch about 4 minutes
Won't waste time with that broad
Young niggas, dope dealers
Some of my niggas crack cards
Niggas talking that tough talk
And it's shots fired at that boy
Young niggas we savage, catch a nigga in traffic
Niggas dying in my city, they like please stop the madness
M.O.E that's how it be, I put this money shit before me
And my lil homie just did three, just let all my niggas free
I've been riding round with that heat
But I've been tryna keep the peace
All these foot soldiers in these streets trying to get a name off me
Trust me, you don't want that beef, it's bodies on that heat
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace
Nigga, you don't want that beef, my niggas won't go sweet
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace
Tell a fuck nigga suck dick
Sneak dissing on the internet, will get you whacked in public
Balling hard no sub shit
Cracking cards all dub
V12 I'm a minute man
Ride with blickers in a minivan
Spot an opp and then we get him dead
Finessing bitches I may renig
Smoking dope in a foreign whip
Dirty money got a nigga clean
Open heads in the magazine
Turn a party to a murder scene
If I send them then they murdering
Silent shots, they ain't heard a thing
M.O.B won't give a bird a wing
Double trigger, 40 with a beam
Will really show me what a nigga mean
Face shots on the back block
Try to run, get your back popped
AK make a mac stop
flip a nigga like a laptop
30 shot got my hand hot, law come we ain't saying shit
We ain't on that playing shit
