My bitch hatin' she like, "You think you tha shit now"
And I can spend 10 on my wrist now
I pull up in them cars wit tha tints now
Turnt up. They like, "Boy you need to sit down"
Nowww, Now
Young nigga takin' trips now
Nowww, Now
I ain't gotta worry bout shit now
I'm the shit now, they on my dick now
I ain't gotta go out lookin' for a lick now
Haters pissed now, they got big frowns
Overload the trap, throw my niggas 10 pounds
Make it flip, show you how to stack them chips
I ain't used to havin' shit
Turned that, into this
And my brother want a whip
So I told him go an' get it
They say the limit is the sky
I tell my niggas its No Limit
Yeah I used to serve the midget
Stackin' money to the ceiling
Now my features is 4 digits
Catch Bibby in the kitchen
I just get it, then I whip it
Then I dish it to my youngins
Then they flip it
Let's get it
[Verse 2: Chase]
People actin' stranger since I got this paper
And my chains a glacier
Politics stay talkin' shit
No scholarship, still stupid rich
My wrist a ballerina, my diamonds dancin'
My squad ball, you just a towel boy
Lil Bibby strapped like a cowboy
Money talks, money on me man that's a fashion statement
Smooth Operator, never asking favors
Kill the club scene, nigga you could meet ya maker
