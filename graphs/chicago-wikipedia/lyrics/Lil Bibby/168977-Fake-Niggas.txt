Got 150 niggas ridin' with me
But I only fuck with bout 8 niggas
No really tho', circle small, cheerio
Hatin' on Lil Bibby flow, when I take off where did he go
Im gone, Cup full of that Kickstand just put me in my zone
Grippin on chrome, haters get gone better watch yo tone
Takin' kush to the dome
Red beam on the gun you'on wanna get domed
Leave yo' face on a lot of shirts
Leave em' dead with a clothing line
In my face its all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
In my face its all smiles
Talkin' down when I'm not around
Fake niggas can't fuck with them
Hatin' niggas stay away from me
GBE and NLMB, them the niggas who fuck with me
Bitch I only want the mouth, yea ho thats all I know
This .30 under this Gucci belt, cock back then we spazzin' out
Robin Jeans and True Religions, this rap shit, we cashin' out
RocBlock or No Block
Tryna' touch this bread but I got niggas at my head
Guess they wanna see me dead, or wanna see me in the feds
So if they on some stealin' shit I'm spittin' it
Faster than I'm spittin' this and faster than that new M6
Might whip out on my newest chick like
"Yea what you gonn' do with this"
Suck it til' it's nice and stiff
