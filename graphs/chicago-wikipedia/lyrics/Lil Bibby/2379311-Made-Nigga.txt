Bitch, I'm a made nigga, Ace sipper
I'm a young paid nigga
Spendin' all my money on guns, I don't pay strippers
Lay with her, stay with her
I'mma run a train with her
With my young niggas
You could have her after they hit her
Sucka, busta, oh you really love her?
Heard that you was workin', are you a undercover?
Our guns come from Russia
I'll have my shooters touch ya
I stay clean on the scene
Two racks for the jeans
Got a .40 with a beam, bitch
What the fuck you mean, bitch?
Know I keep the green, bitch
Youngin' do his thing, bitch
She gon' do the team, bitch
Still serve the fiends, bitch
Lil bro, we gon' come with the K
Ay, broad day, do you broad day
Lay with her, stay with her
I'mma run a train with her
With my young niggas
You could have her after they hit her
Basic blunts
