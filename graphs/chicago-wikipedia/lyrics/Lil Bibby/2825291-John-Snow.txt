(The lord let you come back for a reason)
They think you are some kind of god. It's completely fucking mad, it seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you. The man who returned from the dead
Why is he soundin' so old?
Told 'em fuck all of these clothes, just give me the dough
I'm in Chiraq coolin', countin' hundreds
Like Rob who?
Boy don't no dummy
Please don't run up on 'em, keep a gun up on 'em
He just let off 100 if I say let off 100
They calling me Bibby the King, please stop with the memes
These niggas think it's a joke, we totin' Glocks with the beams
These niggas act like they real, but they are not what they seem
These niggas dying their dreads, tell me what's wrong with they heads?
Yeah I'm a crack baby,
I hang with lucifer
