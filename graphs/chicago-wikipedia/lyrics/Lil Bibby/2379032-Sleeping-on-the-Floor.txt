That .40 got a drum, bitch I feel like Nick Cannon
Drop a nigga, tell a cop, cause I don't know what happened, ay
We got .30s in on Rugers, how my shooters get to clappin'
And we don't got no love for you rappin' ass niggas
Up there pistol tell them strip, with your faggot ass nigga
Got your condo in my pocket, spent your car note on my kicks
And since I cut the lean habit, I've been shoppin' like a bitch
I'm just a trappin' ass nigga, you a rappin' ass nigga
And I'm still in the field with my savage ass niggas
You could catch me on the block got my youngin's totin' Glocks
Hood name Poncho
Real street nigga, I had a nine before Rondo
