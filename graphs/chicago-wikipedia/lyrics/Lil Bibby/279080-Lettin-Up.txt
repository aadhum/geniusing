Ain't a nigga on Earth that can mess with us
All my niggas on top we ain't lettin up(x2)
We ain't lettin up(x4)
Ain't a nigga on Earth that can mess with us
All my niggas on top we ain't lettin up
We ain't lettin up
They can't mess with us
Say two words and that tech'll bust
These fuck boys keep testin us
30 clip in that weapon
Big toys like Xmen
Young boys so reckless
We'll fuck around and get hectic
I'm ridin round' my city
Challenge him with that hemi
Boss shit like Diddy
Prada kicks 450
Wheels black, my Range blue
Block hot, got the feds shook
Lamron back to Fazoland
like 10 of em
OJ he like Mayo nigga
bricks like lego nigga
My rastas with me barbados nigga (2x)
I'm mixing Hen and Ace of Spades I can't fucking see
But im still wearing Louie shades, I'm so fucking flea
These bitches see me, they go cray like they in love with me
