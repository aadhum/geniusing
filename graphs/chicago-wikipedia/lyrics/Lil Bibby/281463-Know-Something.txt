Gang!
Aye, Bibby, what up bro man
150 Roc Block shit man, L's
Niggas don't want smoke man
These niggas don’t want no smoke man
You want smoke man, let us know something
Vito city shit, bitch
I be with some young wild niggas, they’ll blow somethin'
If you want smoke boy, let a nigga know somethin'
Pussy ass niggas talking shit, ain’t on nothin'
Fuck niggas sneak dissin, let a nigga know somethin'
Let a nigga know somethin', let a nigga know somethin'
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know somethin'
Let a nigga know somethin', let a nigga know somethin'
If you want smoke boy let a nigga know somethin'
Mally got that .40 cal with him, blow you down, nigga
I come to the block and post up
I don’t be up in the hood just to put no post up for my Instagram
I see niggas putting posts up on they Instagram
Like you niggas really on something,
Sipping the 4, ACT make me fall over
Run up on me pussy, clap, now it's all over
All white Ones, nigga, I don't like loafers
Young nigga couple chains, all 'em frozen
If I’m lacking then blow or somethin'
Catch Bibby at the store or somethin'
Bro came out the coat with somethin'
Fuck rap homie, I’m in the trap, homie
Couple hollows to the back homie
Brand new Glock let’s see what the gun do
If you want beef then let a nigga know
Subtweeting, why you won't at a nigga for?
You try to tell Bibby, just let this shit go
Till' we show up with them K's then we at a nigga door
