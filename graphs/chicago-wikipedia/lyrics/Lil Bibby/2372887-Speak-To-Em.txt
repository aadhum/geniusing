I say they know that I’m a loose screw, pockets on that Bruce Bruce
Let her stay a couple nights, I hit the road, I’m through with you
These niggas amateurs, fuckin’ on these models and these actresses
I keep it under wraps cause
Bitches runnin’ game and I know they ain’t slick
She gon’ meet a ball player and do the same shit
I swear this shit is hard, gotta watch for these niggas and these broads
Ain’t no friends turn frauds
Still waiting on the day a nigga try to pull a card
Loyal to this thing of ours,
my youngest down to risk it all
Been a young star, back to back in them cars
Studied the attraction law,
she want me to hit it raw
I remember trappin’ all winter
Know I kept it killer, January to December
I was in the trap all day gettin’ faded
Boomin’ like Metro til it got raided
Learn the rules to the game ‘fore you play it
They gon’ ask you, better not say shit
Cause what you say gon’ be used in the court of law
He wasn’t built, got in that room and he told it all, damn
Thought that was your friend right?
He should help you do that ten right?
He was with you smilin’, riding in your Benz right?
air
He ain’t even send you money for a pack of noodles
Thought he was real but he fuckin’ fooled you
Different hood, same story, it’s the fuckin’ usual
Pyramids and stars on garages
He used to serve from the crib and his daddy was the sergeant
My squadron stretched from 87th to the 9, real niggas on the grind
With the power to refine, Know good wine and crime
Expensive watches and niggas doin’ time
Everybody wanna shine, the young stars aligned with us
We used to fuck they babysitters, now these young niggas is hittas
On the streets they deliver
I was that nigga that rolled up and smacked niggas
?
Don’t sleep on my city, we keep it a buck fifty
That’s why I fuck with Bibby, hear me?
