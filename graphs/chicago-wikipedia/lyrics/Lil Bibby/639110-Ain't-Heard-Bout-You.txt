These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes
(Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Four nickles jam, damn he caught a blessing
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping
gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma
knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling
Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy
and do a nigga like Ricky
Said
you can't get out of this game
End up murked like Caine
Yung Berg I'll take a nigga chain
