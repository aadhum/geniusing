I said I came from the mud and I'm really tired of tellin' them
That lean had me stuck, so I had to quit the medicine
I got youngins doin' bids, every month I show 'em love
I got hitters like the Cubs
I'm screaming "No Limit" and that's to the grave
I work like a slave, I got to get paid
smoke 'cuz
I get you murked for a little amount
All these niggas chase some bitches but I rather chase a bag
Forty make my pants sag
Balmain's on my ass
I just use her for a nut, really I know she a slut
brewfurd
Jewish lawyers, so I dodged jail
cartel
