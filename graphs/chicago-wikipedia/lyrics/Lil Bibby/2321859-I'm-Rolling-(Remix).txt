Bust it wide open for a young nigga
Couple racks on me, that's just for the strippers
Herbo in the cut, trigger finger itchin'
Catch a opp slippin', he gonna handle business
And I damn, tryna step on my kicks
These the new J's, they ain't out yet
Whooping on a gram, he ain't about that
And they know the young niggas keep a pole
I be flexing hard, took 20k then I split that shit on close
Man that's just a few shows
I got 3 chains and I keep 'em on me
Niggas send threats but they don’t do shit
Use your head and be smart or you might lose it
You a street fighter, how do you get
With all my young boys keep that tunechi
Got a smart mouth now try to run from it
Marley
Nigga want smoke, they some young dummy’s
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin', I'm rollin'
I'm bustin' this bus and I'm bustin' this bus, somebody pass me a water or something
I'm bustin', I'm bustin', I'm bustin' this bus, somebody pass me a water or something
drinkin' Fiji water
