[Hook: Lil Bibby & Anthony Hamilton]
Said I gotta keep my head above water
I been goin' hard gotta go a lil harder
I been thinking smart gotta think a lil smarter
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Said I gotta keep my head above water
Catch me in the kitchen I be whippin' with the water
Family over niggas, blood thicker than water
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Remember I was tryna stay afloat
Now I’m out here making dough
Trying not to drown, now I feel like Michael Phelps
You was laid up, I stayed up
I funded niggas, time to pay up
I need it pronto, my gun’s fully auto
Something like Picasso how I paint pictures
I done touched 6 figures, I’m the same nigga
And when you touch 7, watch out for these hating niggas

Said I gotta keep my head above water
Catch me in the kitchen I be whippin' with the water
Family over niggas, blood thicker than water
All I know is hustle, get that shit regardless
Guns everywhere, you’d think a nigga was a hoarder
Leave you in a wheelchair, cane, or walker
I’m dealing with the slick talk, pain and torture
All I do is keep it straight, I will never cross you
sorry I lost you
