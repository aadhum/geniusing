This real life, real facts, this ain't rap
Walk into that corner store, we had to stay strapped
Cars and the hoes that I watched on the screen
Come to find out shit is not what it seems
A lot of niggas want this life, I swear they couldn't handle it
I got these niggas panicin' like "Bibby goin' HAM again"
Goin' hard, I want that Ghost and that Benz
Now she talkin' that EPT
Tryna have me back on EBT
Man you niggas can't flow like me, hah
Now what the fuck do I need with a GED?
I went from EBT to BET
And what the fuck do I need with a GED?
And what the fuck do I need with a GED?
