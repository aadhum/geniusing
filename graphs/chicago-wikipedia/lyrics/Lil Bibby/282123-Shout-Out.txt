Shout out my connect, he give techs to the set
my shooters the wildest
Boa I be so fresh like I'm ready for death man shout out to my stylist
My shorties they on it, they blowin', keep scorin' like that white boy on Dallas
Shout out to lil bro, cause for me he gon' blow
He'll let that 40 cal spit
cause I be pourin' pints of lean
Smokin' dope by the ounces
Imma let this 30 squeeze til that bitch go silent
We got choppas that hold a hunnid
We tired of drummin'
I got a lotta haters think I gotta buy a Uzi
I was rockin' Louie inna video wit' Louie
Dumb bitch you can't pick, you fuckin' me AND Louie
Fucked a bitch like 26 and I was still a juvie
Smoke
Juvie
I smoke out wit' Herb
I be ballin' wit' Bibby, these niggas is losers
Got 40s wit' 30s, the shooters is shorties
And on that bitch rollin'
Buy some new choppers for oppers
Black card it ain't got no limit
No exchange when I'm wit' Armani
Young Bama just got out the county
They can't keep real niggas down
AK gun hit up a team
Get on that wit' that machine
Face shots put him on the screen
Tell and they might kill yo mama
Underdog like Rocky
Go hard till they drop me
And they say they got me
Servin' on camera
I told 'em that it's not me
You can catch me ridin' in the Jag
The hammer in the stash
Holes in the skully
We use it like a mask
