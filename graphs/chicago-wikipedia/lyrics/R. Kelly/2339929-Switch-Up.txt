If she ain't fuckin', I'ma switch up
Hit her friend's cell like, "What up?"
I'll disappear in that 'Lago
Then reappear in that Ghost
I hit it hard from the back
And then I let Uber get her home
Same shit, new day
New bitch, new brain
New Ghost, new Wraith
Might just send a Uber, pick a bitch up
Pull up in the car with the lid up
Pull her out the car if she spit up
Take her ass home, eat her clit up
Body like a pinup
Tell her call a friend up, and if she acts stuck up
There's plenty fish in the sea with their fin up
I got another bitch comin', gotta clean up
You know I make sure I hit her with the prenup
Tunechi
