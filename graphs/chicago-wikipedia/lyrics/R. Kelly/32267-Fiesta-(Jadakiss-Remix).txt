We be off in the club sippin la
Red eyed deep in the cut puffin la
Strippers in the back of the club showin la
Soon as I get a buzz, I'm showin la
We pop Cris' on a daily base
Yo you can catch me blowin fresh Chronic
In the new Charcoal Gray M-5 step tronic
And I don't pimp, I just keep my hoes in order
And I keep my neck full of frozen water
I'm spendin tonight, everybody spendin the night
We gon flick it up and hit my man off wit a kite
So when he see it, he can visualize livin the life
But you know that I still got pies for sale
Did you ever think you'd hear the *muah* and Kel?
