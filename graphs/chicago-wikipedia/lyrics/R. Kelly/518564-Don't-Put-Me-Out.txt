Don't talk about it be about it
I won't talk about loving you
Cause I'm gonna be about loving you
I won't talk about coming home
Cause I'm gonna be about coming home
I won't talk about both of us
Cause I'm gonna be about both of us
I won't talk about making sweet love
Cause I'm gonna be about making sweet love
Now all the money in the world couldn't add up to what you did
Cuz when I was down and out you took the burden off of me
