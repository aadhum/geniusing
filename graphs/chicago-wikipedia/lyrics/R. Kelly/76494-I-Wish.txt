How I used to kick it on the front porch
(With you)
And how I used to lay back and smoke weed
(With you)
And all the little basement party joints we'd do
Now I'm just missing you
How I wish
Hmm I wonder how my friends would treat me now
If I wasn't iced up with a Bentley and a house
That's why fake ass niggas get fake ass digits
And fake ass players get a real player hatin' 'em
How I used to hoop off in them tournaments
Voices in my head be telling me to come to church
Saying the Lord is the only way for you to stop the hurt
Dreaming of windows black tinted like a hearse
When waking up to life sometimes seems worse
And all I ever wanted is to be a better man
And I try to keep it real with my homies land
For me to save the world I don't understand
How did I become the leader of a billion fans?
Instead of you all throwing them stones at me
Somebody pray for me
