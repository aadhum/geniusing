[Hook: R Kelly]
Ain't nothin' to a boss, yeah I spend that
I ain't worried 'bout the cost, I spend that
Poppin' bottles in the club, yeah I spend that
I can buy the whole club, yeah I spend that
Throw that money, spend that dough (x4)
Roof off of that, coupe all black
Private jet, did the show, now I'm right back
Take a shot, turn up, and go dumb on 'em
Got Picasso on the wall, I spend that
Tom Ford to the drawers, I spend that
Three bitches, one me
And they all on the dick, call it 3D
I bought a pound out in Paris, oohwee
Ain't inside of this world, E.T
Y'all just gettin' rich, I been that
What you got in your pockets, I see you holdin' them figures
I hope you don't blow it all cause that would just be ridiculous
Don't be all in my section if you ain't talkin' 'bout fuckin'
We ain't talkin' 'bout fuckin' then we ain't talkin' bout nothin'
Cake, cake, cake, cake, get up in that
MoÃ«t (bitty bottles), pop that (what?)
