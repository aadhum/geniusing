Yo, yo, yo, yo, ay yo, from my town to Chitown
R. Kelly got some thugs to make you lock down
Smoke greenie green candyman up in cabrini green
Next time we see him yo, we laying Mr. Biggs down
When I make cabrini green you know I hit Sammy's
We got some chickens in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving 'till six in the morning
you remind me of my jeep
I'm hotter than a lotta men
Switch up cars like Rodman's hair color, then hit your broad
Represent New York to Chitown, like what
Never cross my family, can we all get along? Hell no
I'm tryin' to tell y'all who dat is that rule that biz
Not your baby daddy but Jay-Z, true that is
Better school that kid on who's shoes that is
Or who I be nigga, V.I.P Jigga
