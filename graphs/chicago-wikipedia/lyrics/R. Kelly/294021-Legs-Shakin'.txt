(I'mma make your legs shake, I'mma make your leg)
Tonight’ll be different from any other night
(I'mma-I'mma make your legs shake, leg shake)
Tonight I wanna hear you screamin’ ooohhh (yeeaahh)
(I'mma make your legs shake, I'mma make your leg)
And I’m gonna give you the reasons why I'mma make your leg
(I'mma-I'mma make your legs shake, leg shake)
Baby baby baby baby
I’m goin’ down down down
And do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your leg (oohhh)
I’m going down down down
And do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your legs’ shakin’
Do it ‘til your leg (oohhh)
Until your body cums, until we see the sun
Send you into to shock girl once I touch you with my taser tongue
Can you feel the vibrations?
My tongue just like a Jacuzzi jet
And my tongue just likes to scribble
Morning, noon, and night I gotta have it
I’m a dog eat it up like bits and kibbles
Make me dribble like CP3
Let me be your remote controller
