Ay, listen to my demo, oh!
bump 'n grind
That 12-Play
get that boy some pussy every time
And not to mention when you mix that shit with some Patron
like I got two in it
because I believe I can fly
I believe that your mommy and daddy laid it down, and they did it
To Kelly's 12-Play
Like a DJ we screwin' it
Oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh!
back to seven
sweatin' it out
She's like, "Thank you, Dream!"
I'm like, "No, thank you, Kells!"
stunt like my daddy
Clean the CD, check for scratches
k-k-killa! (Killa!)
I am the best at what I do
(leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle)
I'ma make you change your notes like (leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle-leetle)
I'ma sing to that puss, make it sing right back to me
(fuck)
that ass up to bidness
'bout to get your man fired up in here
fiendin'
my favorite's number four
