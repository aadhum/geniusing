Living down low, down low
Living that double life
Living down low, down low
Living that double life
It ain't right
Okay you, you're saying you came in and
And these two women they, they poured
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, it wasn't nothing like that
All I know is uh, I was asleep, they came in
Woke me up pourin' hot grits
But that damn Caller ID is the reason for this song
