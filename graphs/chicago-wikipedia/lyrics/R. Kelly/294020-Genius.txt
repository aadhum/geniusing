It’s how you make me feel babe
I can feel your butterflies
While I’m kissin’ on your thighs
Go to sleep and when we wake up
I’ma hit that thing again promise
Signs and miracles up in this room
While I’m pleasin’ you
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
Tonight I’m ‘bout to prove myself
You won’t ever have to ask no more
I’ma college grad girl I got my degree
I’m ahead of my class girl you met the real thing
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
I’m blessed with the insight to please your body
