My mind is telling me no
But my body, my body's telling me yes
My love is true (with you) with you is where I want to be (girl, see)

[Pre-Hook 1]
You need someone
Someone like me
To satisfy your every need
I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
No need to look no more
Because I've opened up my door
You'll never feel another love you see
You need someone
Someone like me (girl)
To make love to you baby constantly
