Bounce, it's the new 12-play
Bounce, throw the pussy like Elway
Got 'dro with a bottle of bub
Got a bad red coupe matchin' the chrome
I'm still fresh like (Uh), Impala (Uhh)
Dre's young gun still ridin' the bass drum
Four times platinum, Hate It Or Love It, I'm still number one
one hand on my gun
And my trigger finger still make bitches come
Shaking that rump, both hands on the pumps
Send her home with me, I have ya girl yellin' Uh
Kells, my bitch drunk
But her two girlfriends still wanna have fun
Pass the blunt
And we'll give it to ya, just how ya like it, girl
Step into the club, shuttin' down competition
bump and grind
