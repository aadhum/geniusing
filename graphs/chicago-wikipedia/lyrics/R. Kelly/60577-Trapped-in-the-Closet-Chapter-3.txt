Well, here we are. The four of us...
In total shock...
He says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "Yes", I say, "No", he says, "It's the truth!"
Because this is way more than I bargained for
I'm late, plus I ain't gotta damn thing to do with this!
Then I thought to myself, and said, "Quick, you got three minutes"
Somebody start talking
With all your club hoppin', lyin' sayin' you was shoppin'
And now here you are in our home, and you're callin' me wrong.
Okay, you busted me! And that much I agree, you've caught me cheating!
But this is a little extreme!
Then I said, "Stop arguing!
Brother, spare me the details!
I thought you said your name was Mary, that what you said at the party
Man this is gettin' scary I'm gonna shoot somebody"
Cathy, this is all your fault!
Rufus said they're getting married
unheard!
Grabbed my cellular
Said, "This is so wrong,"
Call up my home
And a man picks up the phone phone phone phone.....
