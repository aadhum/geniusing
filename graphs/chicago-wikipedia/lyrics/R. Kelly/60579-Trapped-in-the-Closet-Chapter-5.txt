Well, well, well, what the fuck is this
A condom in my bed
You better start talking bitch
'Fore I take a match and burn this motherfucker down
plus I smell cigarettes
Is he still here?
What the fuck was you thinking?
Thought that I wouldn’t find this out?
Then I said you must be crazy or
On crack to have somebody up in my motherfucking house
You’ve made your point
But now it’s time to even the score
Said, "That’s right nigga I was there
With this guy in the back of the club"
I said, "I thought you was with your girls"
She said, "I thought you was with you guys"
She said, "Shut up
Don’t you say a word
It ain’t nothing you can say
That I ain’t already heard"

You know my girl Roxanne?
Who the hell is Roxanne?
Who knows this guy name Chuck
Chuck’s cool with this guy named Rufus
And I’m sitting there like, "What the fuck?!?!"
Rufus wife Cathy
the policeman that stopped you
