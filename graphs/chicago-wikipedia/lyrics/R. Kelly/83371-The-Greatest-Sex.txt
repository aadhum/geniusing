From beyond this bed of mine I see
Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn
(that will feast your body all night)
If we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest
I know twelve ways to make your love come down
And the secret places on you will be found
There's no telling what this night could have in store
Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a capricorn
And if we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because
Of the greatest
Something heaven has ordained for the sake of our love
