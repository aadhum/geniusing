[Intro]
You remind me of something
I just can't think of what it is
You remind me of my jeep, I wanna ride it
Something like my sound, I wanna pump it
Girl you look just like my cars,
I wanna wax it
And something like my bank account
I wanna spend it, baby
So get a little closer to my ride
I wanna get to know you lady
And hip me up on how to get inside you
Listen, pretty baby
So pull up to my bumper and let the system sound
Girl, I betcha I can drive you crazy
Turn off the lights, turn off the lights, baby
It's something about this moment
