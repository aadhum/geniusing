[Intro: Jay-Z]
After the show it's the after party then
After the party it's the hotel lobby and
And after the original it's probably this (Fiesta)
It's the new 2 Live Crew,
So thugs, pop yo' toasters, but don't approach us or
chase you like Moet mimosas
Whoever come closest - you've been warned
But niggas don't get the picture 'til the weapons is drawn
Make your way backstage, baby girl it's on
And we'll be drinkin 'til six in the mornin
Poppin bottles of Cris with mama
Fiesta - Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
Fiesta, Fiesta
I put the big body up
I'm wit Roc-Land right, so I'm rich for life
In the new six-hundred with the big rims on it
Drinkin Cris like it's H-2-O
All we do is spend cheese cause we love the dough
