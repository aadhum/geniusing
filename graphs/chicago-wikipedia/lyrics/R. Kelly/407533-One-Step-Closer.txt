Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh...
Well, it’s a quarter to that time Baby
So just make sure you’ve got that nothin’ on
And you’re waiting for me Baby (you)
To walk thru the door, and give it to ya’ Baby
Every way possible, just how you like it Babe
And I’m so thankful for my shinin’ star
So glad I don’t have to wonder where your are
Now, I’m about to get on the elevator baby goin’ down
I’m coming home, home, home
One Step Closer... To You
(And it won’t be long, Baby I’m getting)
One Step Closer... To You
(Said I’m On My Way)
(Said I’m On My Way)
I’m, starting the car right now, while
My imagination is going wild right now Babe
When I get to you, Ooh,Ooh-Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I’m turnin’ the corner, ‘bout to pull up in the driveway
Now, I’m hoppin’ up out the car, and I’m walking to the door
Goin’ up the steps, keys in my hand, unlock the door
Turn the knob, baby now I’m in the house
Up the stairs in the room, DAMN!!!
YOU... BABE
Said you look so good to me laying there, with nothing on
And it makes me wanna’!!!
Kiss every inch of your body
So don’t you go nowhere, just stay right there
I’m gonna’ move a little closer...
Step, step, step, step, step
Ooh I’m at your feet baby
Tell me girl, do you like what I’m doin’
Well, can I Move On Up???
Now... I’m at your knees can see you you’re shakin’
See you can’t take it, girl I’m ‘bout to do it Get Ready-Get Ready
