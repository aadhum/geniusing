The policeman gets in his car
And gets right on the phone
Backing up, shaking his head saying
"Let me get my crazy ass home"
"Darlin' where have you been
I've been worried about you"
Police business
"Your favorite: cherry"
Now meanwhile Miss Rosie's back at Gwen's house
Tellin' it all
"I knew there was something about that policeman
I started to cut loose my dog"
"All I wanted to know
Was what was you gonna do with that spatula?"
"She's a G no doubt"
Now let's head right back on over
To the policeman's house
Kiss him on the cheek says, "I was in the restroom"
Then he said "Whatcha say that for?"
And then she says, "I don't know"
"Sweetheart, maybe it's that time of the month"
Then he says, "Maybe? Maybe that time of the month?"
And she tries to lead him upstairs
But he goes straight to the kitchen
"Hun, I bought you some pears"
And then he said, "I'mma heat this chicken"
"What am I to say?"
Because the truth of the matter is
That she just slept with another man today
Because the truth on her face
He will see it
She's scared out of her mind
Stuttering and shaking and
Still talking about some pears
"With all my might
Woman, I swear I'll shoot somebody
If you been doin' wrong"
But little does he know
Somebody is still right there in his home
