It's the world's greatest, y'all
It's the world's greatest
The world's greatest
I am a mountain
I am a tall tree, oh
I am a swift wind
I am a river
Down in the valley, oh
I am a vision
And I can see clearly
If anybody ask you who I am
Just stand up tall
Look 'em in the face and say
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I am a lion
Down in the jungle
I am a marchin' band
I am the people, oh
I am a helpin' hand
I am a hero
In the ring of life, I'll reign love
And the world will notice a king
Wherever there's darkness I'll shine a light
And the mirrors of success reflect in me
Believe in the pot of gold
