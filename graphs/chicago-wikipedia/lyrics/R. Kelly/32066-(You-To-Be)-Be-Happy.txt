Everyday and night I pray
Love will swing you back this way
Life without you here with me
Ain't the same without you G
Baby, hear me, I never meant to hurt you
Baby come and talk to me
Let me know what's on your mind
Everytime I see you
You're running from me all the time
Cause your lovin' is so good
Sitting, reminiscing on when you started dissing
Spitting in faces in public places
Rolex with wood faces had you chipper for months
Made some dough, did some shows, now you're starting to front
Smoking blunts on the veranda with Amanda
She's filling your head with, "he said, she said
Poppa doing this, Poppa doing that
But don't tell him I said it, cause my Jeep might get wetted"
Forget it, go on take her word like the Koran
Ya'll stay friends, I stay in smoke filled Benzes
I regret putting you on to baguettes
Honeysuckle sips, Vickie Secret pajama sets
You was a Reebok vandal, now you wear Chanel sandals
I made you, why would I play you?
Think about it while in the streets you roam
It's Dom P's and Chris'ties in the fridge when you get home
