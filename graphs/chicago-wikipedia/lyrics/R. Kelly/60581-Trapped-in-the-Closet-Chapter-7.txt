There's total silence, blood everywhere
And confusion on their faces as they continue to stare
Then he picks up the gun and says, "I have a wife at home, I can't have no parts of this"
"James, I can't believe you just said what you said
Cause that's not what you said when your ass was in my bed"
"Get married later, but right now we gotta use our heads
First of all, did anybody think to check if the man was alive or dead"
"You bastards! You've killed my brother"
"He just got out of prison. He's been through a lot
He was talking about changin' his life and everything and to come home and get shot"
Then I said "Baby, it wasn't my fault. This man had a gun on me
And besides, how was I to know that you was getting down with this crooked ass police"
"Sylvester, now hold on. Even though he was in our home
Let's not forget the fact that you was out there creepin' in another man's home"
Twan starts coughin'
Sylvester what is this policeman doin' here?"
"No, I'm okay. It's just my shoulder. All I need is a bathroom"
"Fuck man, I would've been better off in prison"
And now somebody's banging at the door and I'm like, "Oh no! Here we go again!"
Thinkin' out loud to myself sayin', "When is this shit gonna end?!"
"Because I'm not openin' up another motherfuckin' door!"
And the cop says, "Gwen, I'll get it." Then looks at me and say, "Man of the house, my ass!"
"I'll get it, but whoever it is, I'm about to put their ass on blast!"
Then Twan says, "Man, that's what I'm talkin' about! Sylvester, point that shit toward the door!"
Then he snatches the policeman's gun and says "Officer, arrest me later."
