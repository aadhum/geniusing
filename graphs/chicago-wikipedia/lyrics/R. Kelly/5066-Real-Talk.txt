I was at the club with who?
Get tha fuck...man, you know what?
Girl Im not about to sit up here and argue with you about who's to blame
Or call no names, real talk
Who's right or who's wrong, but what's right and what's wrong
Did she say there were other guys there?
Did she say there were other guys there?
Were there other guys there?
Well, tell me this
I've been with you five years and
You listening to your motherfucking girlfriends
I don't know why you fuck with them all jealous no-man-having ass hoes anyway
Don't you think I got enough bullshit on my mind
Didn't I just give you money to go get your
Hair, toes and nails done the other day, hmm
Yeah your ass was smiling then
Gave who some damn money?
I ain't gave nobody no damn money girl?
Is you tweakin'?
You're always running off at the mouth
Telling your girls your motherfucking business, when
They don't eat with us, they don't sleep with us, besides
What they eat don't make us shit
You call my momma's house and what?
Girl my momma ain't gotta screen no calls for me
Real talk, and watch your mouth
Fuck me? Girl fuck you!
And gettin tha fuck up out of Dodge
And the next time your ass get horny
Go fuck one of your funky ass friends
Hell yeah, you probably doing that shit anyway
You gon' burn what?
Bitch I wish you would burn my motherfucking clothes
With your triflin ass, milton
you bogus girl
Milton
Start your car up and get ready to take me home
This bitch then lost her motherfucking mind
