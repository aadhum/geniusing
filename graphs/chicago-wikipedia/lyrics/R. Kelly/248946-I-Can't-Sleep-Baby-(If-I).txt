Girl I must have been crazy to say that it was over
I had to be a fool to yell out we were through
It was so, so crazy of me
Sometimes we say things that we really don't mean
Well I'm sorry baby
Bring your loving back to me
I can't sleep babe
I can't think babe
I can't live babe
Without you in my life
I can't go on babe
This is my song baby
Don't wanna do nothing if I, go away baby
And I can't do nothing if you're, not around
Though I must admit that things got out of hand
When you told me that he was just a friend
I should've had my trust in you
From the very start darling
Cause I never meant for this to end
How can we get it back again?
