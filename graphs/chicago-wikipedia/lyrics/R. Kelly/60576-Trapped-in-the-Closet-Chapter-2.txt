Well now he’s staring at me like as if he was staring in the mirror
He says, “You don’t have to go no further”
“I can clearly see what’s going on behind my back, in my bed, in my home”
“Wait a minute now hold on”
“Ho, I should have known
That you would go and do some bogus shit up in my house
And he stepped to me I’m like “whoa
Paje's Club
she told me she didn’t have a man”
Then he said “Man, please, I'd kill you if you didn’t have that gun in your hand”
“But your chick chose me”
His phone goes off and then things get a little more interesting
“Well good that’s better right? Why can't we handle this Christian-like?”
“Baby, not as sorry as you’re gonna be”
“What is going on inside his head?”
“Turn the car around” (what’s going on over there?)
“Well since we’re all coming out the closet
I'm not about to be the only one that’s broken-hearted”
And he’s like “I’ll buzz you up
I'm on the 5th floor hurry take the stairs”
Baby, this is something I’ve been wanting to get off my chest for a long, long time”
“Wait, I hear somebody coming up the stairs”
“I'm gonna count to 4”
I can't believe it’s a man
(man… man… man…)
