I called your boss and he knows you ain't coming in today
Sex in the morning, sex all day
So baby girl pack a bag and head to my place
Sex in the morning, sex all day
I left your next clue by the sink
It should be a box with your name
Open it up see what inside, whatever it is put it on
Like oley oley ooo
Wanna hear you echo, echo oley oley ohhoooo
Wanna hear you echo, echo
The way you riding it I can tell you like my surprise
Sex in the evening, sex all night
And I'll be waiting for you right there baby
I'll be waiting there to fuck like crazy
I hope your ready to go all day long
I hope your ready girl to scream and moan
Like oley oley ooo
Wanna hear you echo, echo oley oley ohhoooo
Wanna hear you echo, echo
And you don't wanna come down and I dont want you to come down
So girl lets keep coming and we gon go to heaven from this room
And the gates will open up when they see it's me and you
Ooh so unlock the door, come back in girl I got my second wind
