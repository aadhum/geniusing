Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
Just soon as she go to the bathroom
Believe me man this is how them playas do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of this story is cuff your bitch
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Pullin' on her hair like we gettin' in a fight
put my plan in reverse
When I, when I, when I
When I pull up to club all the shorties be like, damn
See I done fell in love with a stripper y'all
Teddy Pain was born to flirt
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass Down
