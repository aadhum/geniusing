Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come on
Let's be real now
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on, let's be real
No disrespect to the time that we spent but boy you must be trippin'
You expect me to post up at home for you, but now the tables are flippin'
I bet you feel dumb now, bet you feel so dumb right now
You're just an actor and this love is a scene
Damn I just wish you would say what you mean
Come on
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come on
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
Come on now let's be real
(Let's be real)
There ain't nothin' that I won't do
From jumping off buildings, moving the mountains
Swim the sea for you
Whatever you want babe, I'll do it
You just let me beg, I'll do it
Anything you ask, I'll do it
Let's be real now
(Girl let's be real)
Let's be real now
(Baby come on)
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
(What do I look like, let's be real)
Come on, let's be real
(Now let's just keep it 100 baby)
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Let's be real now
Come on, come on, come one
Let's be real now
(Real now, real now, oh)
What do I look like to you, seriously?
