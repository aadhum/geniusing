Now I'm dashin' home
Doin' 85
With fire in my eyes
I'm thinkin' about what I'mma do and who I'm gonna do it to when I get home
How could I have been so blind
And then I look in my rear view
I cannot believe this
[Whoo whoo whoo]
Damn, here comes a policeman
License and registration please
No excuses
And no exceptions
He flicks his cigarette
And then gives me the ticket
And did 55 all the way home
I pulled up in the driveway
Hopped out and slammed the car door
Then go in through the back
Bust up in the house
Pull back the shower door
my brother 'Twan came home
With a stupid look on my face
Said, "I forgot he came home today"
Then I turned some music on
I said, "I love you"
And she said, "I love you, too"
Then I called her my sunshine
And that's when I start goin' crazy
Like I was tryin' to give her a baby
The way our toes are curlin'
We must slow down
Before I bust a vessel in my brain
Then she said, "Please keep on goin'"
I said, "My leg is about to crack"
Oh my God, a rubber...
