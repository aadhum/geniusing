I'ma strung yo body
your body like a guitar string
Stuntin in Roberto Cavalli mami wit the dime frame
Hotter than tamales
And I'm not from Texas but I hold 'em, rope 'em, and I yoke they neck
And I'll, I'll lick ya, I'll lick ya down, you taste like cinnamon
Girl, yo booty so swoll', how you got them jeans around it?
It's like that ass is crack the way you got me feenin' about it
Then right after the show, backstage, ass hurtin'
Call me Scotty 'cause g-girl I'm bout to beam up
you're screaming, "Hercules! Hercules!"
this is what your shirt should read
