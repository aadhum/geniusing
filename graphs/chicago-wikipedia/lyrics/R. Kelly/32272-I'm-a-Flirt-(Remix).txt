Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low, I'm a flirt
And when she's with her man looking at me damn right, I'm a flirt
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cuz, I'm a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cuz, I'm a flirt
Now swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
Rolling like I supposed to,
I don't understand when a nigga bring his girlfriend to the club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wonder why all these playas trying to holler at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I would probably fuck with all of y'all
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seen cha girl
Better treat girl right cause another man will
Better eat ya girl like another man will
Cause you leave ya wife and I see ya wife now be for real
How long ya think that's fixin' to be ya wife
Well I'm livin' the life, you just gettin' it right
Ya old lady look at me cuz you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you cause you the business type
That's 'til I came along and put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that ass lookin' thick in the light
I noticed she was checkin' me and diggin' the ice
Tryin' to catch a glance up her skirt, the McLaren in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
See I done +Fell in Love with a Stripper+ y'all
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Er-Ass-Down
I be like "Como se llama, lil' mama? Me llamo Pain
What is your name? I'm feeling your vibe and I'm hoping you feel the same"
Manjackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it
I can't help it if she checking for a platinum type of guy
She be calling you Kelly when your name is Tommy
