Now, usually, I don't do this but uh
Go head on and break 'em off wit a lil' preview of the remix
[Verse 1]
Now I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things ya do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in ya grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field
So baby gimme dat "Toot toot"
And lemme give ya that "Beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce
C'mon
Now it's like "Murda She Wrote"
Once I get cha out them clothes
Privacy is on the door
But still they can hear you screaming more
Girl I'm feelin' whatchu feelin'
No more hopin' and wishin'
I'm about to take my key and
Stick it in the ignition
So gimme dat "Toot toot"
And lemme give ya that "Beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
Cristal poppin' in the stretch Navigator
We've got fellas to my left (left)
Honies on my right (right)
We bring 'em both together, we got jukin' all night
Then after the show, it's the after party
And after the party, it's the hotel lobby
Yeah, around about four you gotta clear the lobby
Can i get a "Beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
Girl, we off in this Jeep
Foggin' windows up
In the back of my truck
Bouncin' up and down
Strokin' round and round
To the remix
We just thuggin' it out
