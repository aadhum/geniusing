And you don't know because you got your girl with you
Bring her with you, bring her with you!
Step up out the club wit a dizzy head
I got two chick that got dizzy legs
I'm bout to double up (One on each arm)
You know I'm bout to double up (I got one on each arm)
dough to a side
front and a freak in the back
Fast as I can on them dubs to the crib
puffin dro
Ain't no competition, yall a couple of tens
first cuz
The way they took me down like a forty, forty
mix 'em up like a dealer
Man three is company, bitch call me Jack Tripper
Be
double or nothing
That's forty toes man, add that up, forty toes
(Uncle Junebug, whattup my nigga)
