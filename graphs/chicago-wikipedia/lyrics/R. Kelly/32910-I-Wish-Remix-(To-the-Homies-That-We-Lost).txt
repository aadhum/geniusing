Yo what up, my nigga
You know I was in the hood
I just thought I'd stop by
Holler at you for a minute
Even when you're gone you will always be my nigga
Though you made it home I'm still missing you, my nigga
I'm feeling like the timing was wrong, my nigga
I know you're smiling down saying carry on, my nigga
Sometimes my nights can get long, my nigga
You remember when Vibe world premiered
How we used to share the same old gear
