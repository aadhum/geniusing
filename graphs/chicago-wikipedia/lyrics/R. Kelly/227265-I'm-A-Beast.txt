Some say i came from heaven but i rose up from hell
And ever since i rose up success has been my cell
So call the hits my lawyer cause they got me out on bail
Why I gotta hate on you? Look at me, I'm rich boy
Say youse a go getta, go get your own shit boy
What it's gon' take for you mouthafuckas to understand ima R&B boss
Kells think he a rapper naw bitch im just tryna get my point across
I've been grindin' for 17 years tryna keep the peace
Well now you mouthafuckas done bought out the beast
You need a hit from kells alright my nigga no problem
Im clean but im dirty
I'm blessed and I'm cursed
Hits lots of clubs take lots of shots of patron
Hold my middle finger up tell haters to get the fuck on
Talk about me on your records to make ya sales better
Play it backwards it probably say (Kells is the coldest ever)
