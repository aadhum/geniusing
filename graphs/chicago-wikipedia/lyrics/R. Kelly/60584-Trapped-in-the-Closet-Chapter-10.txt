Now the midget jumps out of the cabinet and stomps the policemen on his toe
Then he continues to rough up the midget as if the midget was under attack
Then Bridget runs up to her room, goes in her purse and pulls a number out
"Man I was paid not to tell you"
"Trespassin' man I've got the right to shoot you"
"Mr., the man that pay me to this would kill me if I tell"
"God I think I just shitted on myself"
'Twan got a patch on his shoulder
Then she walks away from the table picks it up and says, "Hello"
There's a lady on the other line panicking, crying and talking all off the wall
Gwen says, "Wait, slow down, tell me, who am I talkin' to?"
"My name's Bridget and I found your number in my husband's pocket, I had to call you"
Two minutes later Gwendolyn's shakin' her head sayin', "Girl I understand"
Sylvester says, "Who is it baby?" She hangs up and gives him the address
he lyin' through his teeth
double barrel
"No Bridget"
Then the midget takes his inhaler out and says, "This is not good for my heart"
Whoo while 'Twan and Sylvester are sniffin' around...
Tryna figure out what's that smell...
As they turn and look at each other like whaaat the...hell.....?
