[Verse 1]
Girl you're in the kitchen, cooking me a meal
Something makes me wanna come in there and get a feel
Walk around in your t-shirt, with nothing else on
Strutting passed, switching that ass, while I'm on the phone
Cutting up tomatoes
Fruits and vegetables and potatoes
Girl you look so sexy while you're doing the damn thing
I want sex in the kitchen, over by the stove
Put you on the counter, by the buttered rolls
Hands on the table, on your tippy toes
We'll be making love, like the restaurant was closed
How would you like it babe (Would you like that?)
Tell me right now babe (Hey man, I'm going to call you back)
Girl you're in the kitchen, chilling in your robe
I'm saying to myself, she better go put on some clothes
Tickling and teasing, doing that little dance
Girl you gonna make me lay you down and give it to you more again
This is what I'm ready to do
Girl I'm ready to toss your salad
While making love I'll be feasting you
Girl you're in the kitchen, sweating up a storm
The oven's on 500, so you know the kitchen's warm
Cause here we are still in this kitchen doing it for the third time
