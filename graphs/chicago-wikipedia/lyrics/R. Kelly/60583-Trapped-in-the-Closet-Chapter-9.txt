He looks around the kitchen and says, "Something is really weird"
She says, "Why do you say that?" He says "cause you keep tryin' to get me outta here"
He says "Ever since I been in this house your face has went from white to red
And remember when I first walked through the door you acted like you had seen a ghost from the dead"
"Girl if you hidin' something I'm gonna be so mad"
"What the fuck was that?"
Now the sound that I just heard, it came from this kitchen."
Then he notices the pie on the counter: one slice is missing. Now the story's gettin' scary
Cause he comes to realize that Bridget is allergic to cherry
And then, he looks at the cabinet
He walks to the cabinet, get close to the cabinet, now he's opening the cabinet
Now pause the movie 'cause what I'm about to say to y'all is so damn twisted
Not only is there a man in this cabinet
but the man...is a MIDGET!! (midget) (midget) (midget)
