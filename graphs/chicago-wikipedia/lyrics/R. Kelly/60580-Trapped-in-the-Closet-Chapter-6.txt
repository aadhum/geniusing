Believe it or not
I just started laughin'
Shaking my head
And just kept on laughin'
Thinking about all the things I had been through that day
Then next thing you know we both are
Cracking up on the floor
"I can't believe this idiot really answered my phone"
'Twan just got out of prison and he's on his way home
I got a hangover, been trapped in the closet, slept wit who knows, threatened to kill a pastor"
a gay guy
"Plus I got a ticket"
Meanwhile the policeman he turns around
Just out of concern comes back to the house
My car's parked crooked with the lights on
He looks around, pulls his gun out, then proceeds in
"Wait, you're that damn police"
"Baby, I mean James."
"Gwendolyn I got this
I know your sick and tired of this fool"
"Man get out my house"
Beretta
Visions of him making love to her
He winked at me and smiled
And that is when I went nuts
"Settle down!"
