We gonna let it smoke
What’s baby?
I wanna hit that
You wanna hit this?
Let's go
Might as well go all the way
Hey there ain’t no such thing as a half mistake
So baby boy we might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
Might as well go all the way
Do you have a good excuse
To be on the down low with me
I already got the Magnum glove
You already got your ass poked up
I’m right back smokin’ you
You’re right back injectin’ me
Love is in our veins ain’t it
About to hit it out the park again
Going, going, going gone
Going, going, going gone
Going, going, going gone
Close the curtains,
potential remix
