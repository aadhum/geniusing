Then she comes out and kisses me and to my surprise she isn’t you
Now I've got this dumb look on my face like “what have I done”?
Must have lost the track of time, oh what was on my mind?
Just how I'm gonna get my crazy ass up out this house
And he walks in and yells “I’m home”
She says “honey I'm in the room”
She hops all over him and says “I've cooked and ran your bathwater”
this girl is so good she deserves an Oscar
“there’s a mystery going on and I'm going to solve it”
Now he’s opening the closet (closet, closet, closet)
