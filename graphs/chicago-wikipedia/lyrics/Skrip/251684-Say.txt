I don't need wood in front of me to ask a question
Don’t mean nothing if it ain’t coming from the throne
I’m really just a Sicilian dude who like pasta
And gets mistaken for Puerto Rican no habla's
Matter fact I know a few palabra's
But prolly just enough to order Tapas
Yeah I got something to say but it’s not important
I rather give you words from the source man
Heaven and earth will pass away but my words are eternal
Repent and believe that means turn bro
you could get fired Joe Paterno
And faith come through hearing of the word of God,
Always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame
