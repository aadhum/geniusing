[Intro: Leonard Nimoy]
From far beyond the galaxies I have journeyed to this place
To study the behavior of the human race
And I find them highly illogical
This girl looking at me like a lost it
Screaming at me in the phone lately
I told her we should just abort it
I'm too young to have a baby
I'm heartless hypocrite with a couple of faces
I say I love God, I still trample on his graces, Illogical!
[Hook: Leonard Nimoy]
Highly Illogical (x4)
[Leonard Nimoy transition]
Take the case of modern man
He works all his life, gives it all he can
Saves all his money, works overtime
Pinches every penny, banks every dime
All he can think about is money
But you know he can't take it with him where he's going to go
How I find that fascinatingly Illogical
