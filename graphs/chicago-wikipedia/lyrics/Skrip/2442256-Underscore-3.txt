Rap so clean beat so dirty
Rapping since I was 5, beats since I was 12
I’ve always just been myself slept next to my record shelves (You Know Me)
Saved by The Lamb I preach so
Only way you can be saved is by losing your life today
See the reason I’m undefeated has nothing to do with fame
Has everything to do with the power inside the name
Jesus Christ, God and man in the flesh for us was slain
So you can call me what you want but I will not refrain
From representing the glorious truth of The King who reigns
The author and finisher for His church He will come again
And you act like you don’t notice but one day you’ll truly see
That the same King you deny is really living in me
