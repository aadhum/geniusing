I know that you’ll hate me for this
But I know I cannot lie
So bow down to the one who owns the castles in the sky
Oh in the sky
And I’m never forsaken so I’m always up in my zone (I’m up in my zone)
And I’m never gone fall cuz I’m keeping my eyes on the throne
My soul is God’s so it’s never sold
Because of Him I am set free
