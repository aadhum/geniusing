(It is written)
You ain't got a ring
I ain't laying with you
She wanted one night
Girl I ain't a rental
Tu-turn from that bed
Run away like Joseph
She said she'll put me to sleep
But, I ain't takin' that dosage
Tu-turn from that bed
Run away like Joseph
She said she'll put me to sleep
But, I ain't takin' that dosage
