I say a prayer for these playa haytas (Amen)
They all wishing that I never made it
Don’t you see these chains that my God breaking (Hey)
Jesus more than a prophet
This is real life, real life, real life, real life, real life
Let me show you what it feel like
Cuz ain't nothing else gone feel right
There’s nobody better nobody ever you the trendsetter x 4
And all my days my God is near
And He walks with me and won’t disappear
Cuz I roll with the greatest who’s holding the crown
Everything that I got in this life i'mma give God all the glory
And He go before me He writing my story right
We these new disciples
Holy spirit livin Holy Spirit driven
We believe The Bible
I know that Christ was risen, now he throne sitting
They gone think we psycho
But when you know how much that you’ve been given
You realize you living, God gonna start your mission
And make sure you don’t miss it
This is real life, real life, real life, real life, real life
Let me show you what it feel like
Cuz ain't nothing else gone feel right
