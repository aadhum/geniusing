Promise I get so high
Have you ever seen God?
Have you ever seen God?
Wonder when it will stop
The cops, yeah they kill kids
Then act unfamiliar
Then cover up the case like it's makeup concealer
The truth is in your face, no filter
Would we just move them Ziplocs?
Our only get rich plot
I wonder when it will stop
Wonder when it will stop
Wonder if it will stop
I don't think it will stop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
One day I got so high
To the point I seen God
Fill my eyes with tear drops
I'm sitting on a gold mine
I learnt about the re-rock
We boom until it's all gone and then we go and restock
I wonder when it will stop
Wonder when it will stop
Wonder if it will stop
I don't think it will stop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
Let me let these tears dry
Now I'mma make this song cry
Lay it all on the line
Had to watch some friends pass
Man, that shit fuck me up
Turn me into Mad Max
And I got some homies out here tweaking off that Xanax
Amongst other products we import, sweat a jab like a grab bag
Damn, that shit fucking with my conscience
But that's the price you pay when just tryna see that profit
I said wonder when it will stop
I swear that I'm a good guy
So tell me who's the victim
Don't tell me 'bout statistics
They turn us to some numbers, then just add them to the system
And don't tell me that we stuck here
Don't tell me it's just physics
Don't tell me 'bout them problems
Just find a way to fix it
I wonder when it will stop
Wonder when it will stop
Wonder if it will stop
I don't think it will stop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
World gone mad so for that I let a tear drop
