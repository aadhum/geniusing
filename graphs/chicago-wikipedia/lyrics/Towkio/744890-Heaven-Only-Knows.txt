That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
Look, my girl tripping, say I treat her like a groupie
But I never took a groupie out to eat
See I've been balling, I've been popping
I've been bubbling, I've been buzzing
In my city women love me, think I'm pretty
And they confirm it whenever they see me in person
If I said it I meant it, I said it on purpose
Don't sleep on that furnace cause, boy, we hot
And it's my job to make you think, and make music that you feel
And these songs should make you sing
Ohh ohh ohh, I guess we'll never know (heaven only knows)
What we need to know, where we need to go
Mind in the right field like I'm Ichiro
I shed light, they need to grow, fuck 'em all
Fuck they friends, fuck they car, fuck your brand, fuck your blog
It's SAVEMONEY, we an army full of generals
Here to push the envelope
And change what they think
It's my job to make them think, and make music that they feel
So these songs make them sing like:
[Hook: Towkio & Eryn Allen Kane]
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
That's why I love it, I love it, love it, I love it, love it, I love it
If I drop it they gonna cop it
I might start a non-for-profit
My poppa say, "Chancelor, I am so proud of you"
Like my beats? They made all of them
Kick my feet on the ottoman
I just might run for Alderman, you got power too
Sneak that rap, put a message in, it's that sugary medicine
Feel like the intro, but better than it's ever been
Jumping like checkers, clever like chess is
Smoking like purp is, perfect like Surf is, deeper than surface
Anxious and nervous, the world isn't flat, it's sharp as a circus
It's starving like sharks is, that's looking for surfers
I'm not in the industry, not in the service, not into retail
Not into nodding my noggin, neglecting the detail
I'm only beginning, behold magnificence
Brown-skinned black boy
When his dread-head friends tall and omnipotent
You choke like cinnamon,
you broke, I been the man
Triiibe, SM and 197 at your fuckin' neck, boy
IGH!
[Hook: Towkio & Eryn Allen Kane]
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Ay yo, why you about to have the hottest tape of 2015? It's stupid
This song is already so hot, I'm actually just glad you let me rap on that bitch
