I promise he ain't gotta know, baby v√°monos
Tryna act like you ain't gone off the juice but I know you might
I could feed your appetite, do the things that I know you like
Good head, good lips, good wrap, good stroke, good clothes if that's yo type
If so then you struck gold, just slow and play your role
To the rest I'm UFO, here then I'm out of side
Take it as a sign like a dotted line I got it I ain't gotta try
And she rather be with me instead of him, but that's not lady etiquette
