You know all my homies, my hair back, I look like Hiroki
These bitches they send me emojis
They love me, they love me, they love me like mommy love kids
They want me like I'm fugitive
They say that I'm crazy, I know that I am
Bitch, my mind out the box just like I'm movin' in
How you talk numbers? u dont run plays
Got a back sprain, you ain't move no weight
Don't know what to do, think its sweet, we don't fuck with you
Fuck a tooth, we'll make his whole body decay
Watanabe my body
I know the dopeman's dopeman
Keep the cooker in the kitchen, in the kitchen cookin' fork
White got a nigga feelin' like he's black Jesus
I got the molly with the yeezus
Bitch, international features
Ass thick like the accent when she speakin'
Purple
Young Purple, Young Purple
That Rei Kawakubo stay on me
Pray that stray bullets never strike a martyr
Would you rather be the shooter or the mothafuckin' target?
I don't play about my money or my momma or my daughter
Hit the Whitney if it's clean
Dimethyltryptamine make a young nigga dream
Now I'm really off the shit!
