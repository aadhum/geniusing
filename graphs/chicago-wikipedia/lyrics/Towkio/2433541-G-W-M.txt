I been outta body
Tripping off some molly
Or some DMT
Seeing things different to the point
Ooo I got Vic with me
That mean Ye with me
Mean Jay with me
Kim K with me
Beyonc√© with me
I pull up at the party
Never say sorry
Y'all know me, MVP
I got gang with me
That mean Jay with me
'Yonce with me
Just Blaze with me
Save Money
Kene
Nigga fuck Spike Lee
City notorious for niggas getting shot
It's not a movie scene
Do it big I got Faith with me, oh
That mean Puff with me
Like Sam Cassell
It get ugly with me
MDMA
moon rock Yeezys
Cost you a stack but these 950
Save Money
She gonna do it for the freebie
This not Fiji
And I'm with gang
So please be easy
Sitting here I'm like
"Feed me, feed me"
I gotta make sure that everybody eating
At the plate, it's squad on deck
It get out of hand
You get stole off, Ron Artest
I'm trying to fuck all hoes
I need real sisters
Got that lean on me
Crack a seal with you
I don't want to chill with you though
In the same denim
Ain't shit changed
But the change in 'em
