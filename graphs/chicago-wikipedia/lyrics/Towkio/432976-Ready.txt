If you ready, then why you waitin'?
Servin' tables ain't turnin' tables, don't get complacent
Or start complainin' or start confessin' I'm not Usher Raymond
Born Sinner in this Cole world, don't test me
That glacier'll sink your boat but the same thing will bring you hope
I said I've been ready
I'm tired of waitin', I'm tired of playin', this shit stress me
Like when I'm gon' make it and how they gon' take it
I told 'em dig, dig, dig
Pass the surface, see what you get
Boy I give 'em gifs
That's a moving pic,
I hope you ready, there's so much more in store
get your mind out the box
Quit aimin' for the backboard
