I don't play that much I'm coachin' now, come and join the team
I'm in this bitch I swear to God just check the ultrasound
Man I swear I'm dreamin' lucid in this bitch, controllin' everything
That's we be ballin', we be ballin' in the major leagues
You minor, you in Triple A
I leave you broke down, need you Triple A
I'm chargin' like I'm Triple A
That ain't USPA, they imitatin' (But it ain't no Ralph tho)
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
It's my birthday
