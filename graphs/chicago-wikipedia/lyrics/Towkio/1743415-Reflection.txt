You take yo' time, that bathroom line can wait
You know yo' worth, like to keep options in play
I see yo' cup empty, yo' face all blue, yo' phone on 2%
I see those guys who shot at you
You shoot them down, then it's back to the bathroom
[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, look at you
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, I'm right here
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, I'm right here, I'm right here
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, look at you

[Bassline/Collision]
Look at you, look at you
Look at you
Look at you, look at you
Look at you
Look at you, look at you, look at you
You take yo' time
That's right, the world moves at yo' pace
Alright, don't change, control minds, get yo' way
I see yo' cup filled up, yo' heart empty, everything not enough
I see those lines, you see them too
You shoot them down, then it's back to the bathroom
[Pre-Hook]
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, look at you
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, I'm right here
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, I'm right here, I'm right here
Cocaine, on the mirror, see yourself
Look at you, look at you

[Bassline/Collision]
Look at you, look at you
Look at you
Look at you, look at you
Look at you
Look at you, look at you, look at you
