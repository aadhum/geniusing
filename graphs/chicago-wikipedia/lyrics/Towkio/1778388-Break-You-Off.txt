Be cautious what you speak, those thoughts become tangible
A great mind be caged, it still turn you to an animal
What we have in common is the conscious
So I speak on the subjective, cause the rest is nonsense
Some answers might surface, wave theory
Brain waves change currents
Cause a shift when you shape your thoughts
In control of the outer space, mind is God
Just the taste will make them salivate
Peek will make 'em drop a tear
Scent will make 'em fall in love
Sound will make 'em close their ears
This feeling give they body chills
Don't get involved
I give them art, that's on my soul
So why the fuck you think I even made this song
I had no choice, I'm screaming till I lose my voice
It's why I'm in too deep
I give 'em water, make 'em think
Oh, but I can't make 'em drink
