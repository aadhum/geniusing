Os-cill-ate
Imagine my vision
But you can't cause your mind's in the prison
The shine from the prism can blind in an instant
This the new standard of living
Combined it with wisdom, apply it to physics
This shit get acidic
If I said it, I meant it
I live it, you mimic
I'm living no limits
SAVEMONEY the modern No Limit
If you feel it, then question it
Only speak for your benefit and meditate on the writing tip
Ossssssss!!! (x4)
