It’s young Towk
I give ‘em water in a drought and watch the flowers grow
Do it for my city where it’s windy so I’m bound to blow
And they dominoes, they playing both sides, so never get too comfortable
I charge that to the game, that’s nonrefundable
We the ones they hating to make it to the top with them convertibles
No this shit is Geico, I got you covered
Yeah it started, me and my posse, me and my colleagues
We some riders, we drivin’ past them, we Ricky Bobby
Just know that World Wide Wave coming soon (3W!)
