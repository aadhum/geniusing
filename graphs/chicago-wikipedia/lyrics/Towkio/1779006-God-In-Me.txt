Chiraq, nigga west side, call that shit my homeland
I done smoked too much dope, I'm gonna need my own strain
poured up too many 4's, need a kick stand if I'm gonna stand
Know some real niggas that'll ride niggas and chill niggas that don't
and
Bad bitch with some face tats, she FaceTime my phone man
heater leave his ass cold, ham
Chopper get him with the program, we don't shoot, we throw hands
I'm a grown man
With a game plan
But I don't play
I stand where the coach stand
I make art, make sense
Matter of fact it's more than that
I make a difference
Change your mind, save a life, pray for lord
Thank god or thank me if you're not religious
Save Money in this bitch
Yeah they love me, yeah they love me, that's the God that's in me
That's just the God swaggin' super hard, swagger superstar
Pull up in that black Uber car with the door ajar
It's young Towki, yeah they know me, when they see me they approach me
Like an infant or a puppy, swear they love me
Really I be going cray all the time, every day, think that I control the waves
.Wav Theory, move the moon, move the earth, sure enough they all gravitate
Swear opposition need the good book
I know hot boys that say Holly Grove
And where I'm from we can never fold
There's creases all up in our clothes
I ain't never know no pump fake
free Three
Then it's game time like E3
Nigga Leather Cords season hot for no reason
