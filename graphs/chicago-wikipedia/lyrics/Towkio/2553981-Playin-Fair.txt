I swear we taking it over
And I stepped in this bitch and
They feel I'm fresh out a coma
I mean this flow is so static
Get shocked you get any closer
I drop the lean in mimosas
And my body got marks - I'm art
I swear this the MOMA
No Smith, I need me a Jada
I might just kick it with Jaden
I see the future like That's So Raven
I know what I know
But I know 'bout them O's
And I know 'bout folks in the most and
Dressed up with hoodies and straps and
They come and kick down your door and
Won't need no warrant for that
And I'm a brother of father
And my nephew we growing
My mama, she always working
Finally got a promotion
And every day yeah she text me
She call me, tell me she love me
I told her "Mama don't worry
I'm try'na get to this money"
And I ain't got no homies
Man I only got family
Talking Victor and Chano
Joey, and Chukwu, and Dally
We used to whip in the Caddy
Until that bitch got impounded
From the city of Gotham
Who knew this garden would blossom
I got a cup with a cup in it
And a sprite with some stuff in it
And a pocket with pills in it
And the world at my finger tips
Now we came a long way
From that cup with some lean in it
Rick Rubin
Uber black cars pick up my black friends
With black cards, they rap stars
I'm talking Victor and Chano
blind
Ray Charles, Ray Liotta
your fist fight
With a dirty .380
