[Intro]
Zan with that lean
Nuthin but Irene
Hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
SAVE MULA!
Up out that jam I am
You see my jab goddamn
Got hella this; got that
Man I lied said I should be hero
So I die young live fast
Saving all of my cash
Ridin' round in my city got my city on my back
[Hook]
This that Zan with that swag
Molly n that tab
Hoes going crazy when I got my jab
All this work on me
That's why I be lowkey
Savemoney army so i do it for my team
Yeah I Do it for my team
Do it for my team
Bitch I'm 32 degrees get froze
I'm so smoked out in my whip I can't see where I'm going
