I say these women bat they eyes every time I ride by
Keep a bad bitch on my passenger side
She rollin' we stay high,
Chi-Town where I reside
Sippin' pink
and smoking purple boy these colors keep me high
I keep that rubber burning
kush burn it grind it keep
Rubber burning kush burn it grind it keep the world turning
With the world turning never forget
Live life with a purpose to be perfectly perfect
Until they closing the curtain
Because my visions is wild as my imagination may permit
It's not easily worded I'm curving it for your service
I see you stuck on the surface It's ok if you nervous
I tell em that they should keep up
So Chi make them cheeks blush
SaveMoney you see us I make your girl a believer
If you know me then you know that I stay fly
My denim from Japan,
and my weed from the Bay Side
Say they better than they lie, get better it takes time
See I run it like Payton, but back in like 8-5
P.I.M.P.ology but logically be learning these hoes biology
I'm smoked out don't bother me my wallabies
My policies
That twitter handle, bitch follow me
Rollin' with purp you IDA B (oughta be), but obviously well
I'm on my westside westside shit
pay me for my penmanship
Bet yo bitch remember this 2 gold rings no championship
My whip game,
my wrist game,
my bitch game, so vicious
My hair tied, my shirt wide, I think I'm Jimi Hendrix (Bang)
Rolling up that flocka flame
SaveMoney we got it mayne
Chi-raq where them choppers clap and them bodies snatchers stay wildin' mayne
My whip game, my wrist game, my bitch game, so vicious
My hair tied, my shirt wide, I think I'm Jimi Hendrix
