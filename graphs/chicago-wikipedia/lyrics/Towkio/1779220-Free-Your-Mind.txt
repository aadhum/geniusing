Baby I can heal you if you hurting it's alright
Cause I know something's missing
In your life and you're not satisfied
So trust me, reassure that
When we're together you'll have a good time
So right now close your eyes babe
Take a deep breath and free your mind
I can free your mind (x4)
Said don't you worry
All those that give input don't worry at all
They minuscule in the big picture
In this position of which we're involved
So kick them out your circle and stay universal
You'll be close to the stars
Feel the vibration and go on
I'll sing if I want to
Do my thing when I want to
Do anything that I want to
Do it if I want to
I'll sing if I want to
Do my thing when I want to
Do it if I want to
