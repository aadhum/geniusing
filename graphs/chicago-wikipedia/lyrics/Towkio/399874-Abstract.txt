Okay, I make art, make sense
Matter fact, maybe my
Work is, too abstract
And it go, over heads, carry on
I was born alone, I'mma die alone
Like okay, I make art, make sense, that's that
Matter fact, maybe my, work is, too abstract
And it go, over heads, carry on
I was born alone, I'mma die alone
That's a different song, my pen out, my pistol drawn
And I'm sitting on the world like I'm sitting on your couch with my shoes on
Give a fuck about what you want, I could care less
Need a headrest because they bore me because my cup filled with morphine
Tell Nike endorse me
Tell Kim and tell Kourtney
Tell Kylie and Khole
Tell Kendall I love her
are born into
So I proceed with caution
God damn I'm important
Got a mind worth exploring
That's a mind full of gold get your portion
[Bridge: Kanye West and Sway Interview]
That's the saddest song but on a different note
I be at the crib all alone
Painting pictures, making movies, writing songs
Writing hooks, and fuck around writing a book
About the mind and how it works and no degree
They could lie but that's just me
And leave behind a piece of mind, a piece of me
It has to be a piece of me, a masterpiece
[Outro]
And it ain't no Ralph though
It ain't Ralph level
(Okay, well let me ask you this)
(I'm asking you)
What's the name of your clothing line?
We don't know
