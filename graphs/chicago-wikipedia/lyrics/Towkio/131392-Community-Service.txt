The way I kick it
I kick as if my name was liu kang
Im hotter than blue flAme
Spitting that jon wayne, kill em leave em wit no name
As sane as kurt cobain in my lo mien
As smooth as Coltrane when I hit a stain
Tell em I ain't playin, I already won, this the post game
Run it like emit in the old days
you run it for no gain
Wit no propane needed
I get heated immediately
An get to kicking like a developing fetus
My mind scenic, im genius
If u scene it u would probably be tweaking
Everything thats real is the opposite
If your not convinced, then tell me how ur body gets
A feeling an senses when someones watching it
For get it, its probably to hard to comprehend
Ill probably get shot for this, fuck it im already probably dead
Living in a box so they limited
Cold blood got yo body shivering
m a pimp, life a bitch
So we getting intimate
Hit once, hit again then I pass her to a friend
And im getting dividends when I go an middle men middle
Cuz im more plug then a television is
Im scotty pippin wit the assist
Naw fuck that im ray lewis at the line of scrimmage
Flyer then dasher, vixen, dancer, pancer, comet, cupid, donner, and blitzen
St. nicholas give em gifts when I spit this
but im not r. kelly so don't step to this
