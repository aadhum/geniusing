I said it’s on, but really that’s an insult
But it’s ok, they wanna get involved
But we in here like in ingrowns
See ya look around and look like your friends gone
So I’mma walk up, don’t ya dare put me in the friend-zone
If you got a man or your friend don't, it's on
In this bitch, get it jumpin’ like a pinball
It's save money, but that dirty money get rinsed off
And somehow we feel like a wishbone
I post like a big man, ball like I’m the sixth man
I’m mighty clean, I just said that, I’m a muthafucka
flow wet, need an umbrella
Ok, I see you go ahead, go and make your stand
I ain’t got no protest
You trying to reach your goals and they tryin’ to goal tend
That’s the son of a gun,
Goten, they a son of my son
Like oh God, I’mma break it down to the neutron electron
Proton
the city of the Go-On
So why you trippin’ like two left feet?
I just wanna make you sing, my dear
Hey, like do-re-mi, uh
my position here
On top of you fucks like missionary
I ask her if she been with her friend said no
Maybe so, Perry's at Lolla, I kissed a girl like Katy
No bands, but she says she heard me on the radio
80 on GCI [?]
heard of BBC
In my ice-cream shit like P but a lil more newer
I don’t need a Lois Lane
I guarantee these hoes follow suit
But I do SAVEMONEY that's crew, what it do
Couple of girls wanna run that three
In the club finna close at two
We’re takin’ chances
Look how she dances, oh, like she wanna be involved
Oh, now they all wanna get involved
