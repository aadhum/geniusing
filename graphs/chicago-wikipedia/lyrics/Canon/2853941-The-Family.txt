Typically, they contemplate about haters
But know that Canon ain't comin' to waste time, don't waste mine
When they talkin' 'bout the squares I can't find em, no
Not up in my circle and we stay grindin'
808
This is for all of my day ones who been before there was Canon yeah
Back then, where Chi town, Greater Way and Lawndale was there from beginning, yeah, (Give it to 'em)
Back when Phil Jackson the House in Chicago showed me how to live this
Yeah, back when they called me spook before I had to consider my image yeah
From mix tapes after mixtape, the great investment was a new beginning
Writing "Popping Off" and ripping "Good To Go", "Man In the Mirror" to "Bring Me Low"
From killing Canon down to writing "Ten Toes"
Gave em "Runaway" to writing "Loose Canon"
Writing "Yeen Bout that Life" on "Loose Canon"
"Let 'Em Have It," "Motivation," "Loose Canon"
"Loud Music," "Trippen," "Dreams," "Loose Canon," "Put Me On" to "Point of View" and still standin'
So many more and they still embracin' it from "Take It All Away" I'm "Grateful" they been waiting I just want to take a moment just to thank em
You can call them your fans but I call them my family, and cause all of your prayers I'm still right here standing
But I wouldn't be here without all my friends yeah
Cause I could've been dead so when I do this know I do for my family
