I go and act a donkey on 'em
I said I act a donkey on 'em
King Kong ain't got nothin' on my hittas my gorillas go bananas like a monkey on em
I'm cuttin' all the conversation
I got joy but the devil tryin' to confiscate it
Go and act a donkey on 'em
Go and act a donkey on 'em
Go and act a donkey on 'em
Go and act a donkey on 'em
(2x)
I'm a tell 'em I'm trippen
Trippen trippen trippen
Tell 'em I'm trippen
Trippen trippen trippe
I'm comin' to your house yeah
