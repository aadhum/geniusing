I'm drifting y'all, I'm losing my patience
I wish He could take it all away
I feel I can't take it, cause I've been up in it so long, my heart is racing, I wish you could take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
Take it all away, Take it all away
I'm tired of eating lemons
Come and catch me at tha Crossroads like Bone Thugs
picked up the floor mat and now I'm walking out
I've Been Sitting up in that bed, and I got this metal off in my leg
Jaw is broken, coming down off a ledge
I've been contemplating that I should of been dead
I ain't never been scared to look at my grave, God has already numbered my days
And still try to wonder why was I saved
Could of died below but instead I got raised
Aye look at my face and look what I've faced
Me close to dying was nothing, thats grace
Knowing I believe, that I struggle to have faith
