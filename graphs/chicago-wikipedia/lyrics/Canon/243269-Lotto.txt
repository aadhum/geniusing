And we ain’t did nothing, nothing at all
Ohh but we winning
So till the day that we go
You know we gon put on
We ain't losin' no more
My team winning
Me and my dawgs
Cause some one took the heat and that should hit us all
Because of Him im set for life just like I hit the lotto
My track record was
So ruthless,
CuZ I done hit it big like I hit the lotto
but i feel like I ain't got new friends
And My old partners, they don't like change
But I ain't got no  time  for no life games
It was really the blind leading the blind
And I ain't losing
And we ain’t did nothing, nothing at all
Ohh but we winning
So till the day that we go
You know we gon put on
