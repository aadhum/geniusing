I'm in the passenger seat while God is controllin' my
Life and career, my life's in His hands while upholdin' us
I'm so gone with the challenge, which one of these rappers as cold as us?
Wax on wax off with caution
Give 'em bars, handle,
Loose Canon got three V's on the station, who's down for the patience?
I'm after the Lord's heart, speedin' tryin' to go faster
So whether I eat on this beat or another, why should it matter?
All things are permissible but not all beneficial
Dyin' daily is costly, sin and death for their wages
They say that only God can judge 'em but they don't fear that
All you been dishin' out, you gone take for
He got guns bigger than ones that you got a case for
The media gotcha while you been Harlem Shakin' for dollars
Twenty seconds for the fame on the Gram will take all your honor
Prostitutin' for likes while they Twitter spammin' for followers
