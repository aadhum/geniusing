I'm feeling hot, cool and vicious like I'm salt and pepa
Could it be very necessary
Going insane, cause a good thing, will I ever find
[Verse 3: Canon]
[Outro: Canon]
Aye man I hear what you saying and it's all good but in reality...

Bro... it's cool
If you gone listen then listen. I'd rather you tell you me you wouldn't than act like you would
But it's on you
You're a grown man
