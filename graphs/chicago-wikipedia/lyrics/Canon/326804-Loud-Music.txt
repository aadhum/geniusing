Ay this that wild music
That loud music
Start a riot in the crowd music
That jump around and get sweaty
Throw them elbows in they eye music
I'm sweaty, get a towel music
That 808 shake that ground music
That walk around in that Kroger
Then go act a fool in that aisle music
Then go act a fool in that aisle music
Go ride around with no top boy
Ain't lookin' round for no cop boy
Beat the beat down the block boy
Bump and no tryin' to turn down boy
If your shirt's still dry you ain't geeked up
All my partners round ya are inked up
Follow me as I follow Christ
And I saw the King and got jacked up
And I'm RMG and y'all knew that
Bodysurfing the crowd music
Big boned my body type
But I'm that dude that might do it
Mutumbo
Now King Kong my bass
1 1 to that 6
I done hopped out my grave but I ain't a zombie
Bass beating, bells ringing
You can call it Rocky
