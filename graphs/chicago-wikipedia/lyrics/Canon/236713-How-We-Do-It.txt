Yep, That boy young Canon
Lecrae
Thi'sl
1 to the 1-6
I been all up through your city
And all they really wanna know is "Where's Crae' tho?"
But that's coolio-cool
I'mma lay low
That background, that's my j-o
Homie that work that I work isRomans 1:16
Dig it deep like Drano
I've been in it from beginning
Been following nothing but the model given in the scriptures
It ain't nothin' that I'll rather do but then keep the 116 in the mission
If you heard it all before then get ready get another from a brother tr-trippin
Tryin' act like we for the glitz and glam
Got em' lookin like,"Hey, I can't believe they Christians."
You see that 116 tat, that STL snapback
Them concord 11's on
Fatigues, they gray and black
They say we lookin' like a gang
Like we came to shoot it up
This Full Ride
we turnt up
No purple kush, no lean
And we headed to yo' city
There's soldiers ridin' wit' me from NY to Mississippi
You already know my crew and what we on
The logo ain't no joke tho
Boy, it's tatted on my soul
Screamin' 116, you see these folks out of control
My faith all in yo' face, ain't no fakin in these songs
Tryin' to blow me off while they blowin' marijuana
Pop-pop, now he's a goner
You ain't gotta know me
But you got to know about The Rock tho
This ain't bout no music bruh'
This real rap
Cuz' real recognize faith
And you can get a tat of 116 on the back
And yeah that's cool
But we don't do this for no show kinfolk we live that
