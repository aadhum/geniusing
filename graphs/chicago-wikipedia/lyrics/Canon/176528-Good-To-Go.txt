Chorus:
You good to go I'm good to go, tell e'rbody I'm good to
You good to go I'm good to go, tell e'rbody I'm good to
You good to go I'm good to go, tell e'rbody I'm good to
You good to go I'm good to go, tell e'rbody I'm good to
We gotta be coming hotter than chili
then colder and bigger than Free Willie
Then harder then harder then harder then jacking up everything
[ Busta Rhymes interruption ]
We gotta be coming hotter than chili then colder and bigger than
Free Willie then harder then harder then harder then jacking up everything
Then burn 'em then turn 'em over giving rappers the third degree
To show the secular industry they don't see the enemy
