I've dipped my brush in the bucket of Gods Glory
Hoping to paint the world a new picture, a new story
One they've never seen with a clear mind
Exercising and putting into practice the Talent in I that heâ€™s designed
Trying to put me in your box won't do
I got too much in my system so what you gone do
It ain't only me who different I done brought the whole crew
From a planet where the same old tradition won't do
