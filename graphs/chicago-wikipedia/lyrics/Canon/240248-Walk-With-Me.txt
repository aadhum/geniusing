I'm starving, I got an appetite for better places
This current residence is done, disintegrating
Following hope is what We bank on start chasing
The glory of God was spotted like it was Dalmatian
Discovered when looking for answers in many places
Realize we don't
Trust God, in our nation
A penalty paid when unbelieving its damnation, You better follow Or find out your Final destination
Death!
I'm sick and tired of my inner nature
Been waiting to travel the road of redemption and restoration
This current earth of oppression is only D pressing
In deed pressing I am, to find the land sacred
If You need the escape then walk with me
I'm the feet and hands of Eli with God in me
That book it dwells in the heart it's to keep my arms empty
I'm armed been ready to travel knowing that God sent me
Look around me all i saw was  total destruction
Depraved hearted debased minds that can't function
I was the same
The blaze of a woman's seduction
I gained a little but died tryna be satisfied
Was chained down to my pride And handed lust to the eye
Became blind to that real beauty
You better come around follow follow
There's peace in the land where the fathers name is hallowed hallowed
Knowing that where you been living is vanity is hard to swallow come to salvation
Grace through faith the motto y'all know!
