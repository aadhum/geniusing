Whatchu know about your life passin' by?
Right before your eyes, right before your eyes
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
Okay, twisting choppin' I was fighting dark
Got a wife at home
So I'm one to talk about blessings
From way up like Tetris
Broke down to pieces
Get on my JR shooting until I hit the bucket
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
Aaron
I couldn't talk at all, had to write with Post-Its
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
See I gotta be grateful
