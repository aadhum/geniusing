(I wanna run away)
(I wanna run away)
(Anywhere I can stay)
(I wanna run away)
[Verse 1: Canon]
I'm 24, Been that young boy
To learn the game I had no choice
I Put in work and I ain't learn to navigate life without my folk get'n annoyed
Like 'Crae and Nate with them hard talks
RMG and my learned faults
'Cuz Discipleship was that life on life, and they been here for them long Walks
Found BJ with ground work, taught the youngin' that love life
How to Network with them boulevards, tryna bring the peace to they thug life
My Hard head made my life harder
So stubborn full of that pride
Me tryna prove what I ain't have to prove was just affirmation I ain't find
'Crae got me, Derek got me, doc and AT, Nate got me, BJ and I never forget just how Terrence G and Phil Jackson got me they dug deep in my trenches
Put scripture down in my senses
I done felt the heat from my brothers swear I be sweatin' sittin' in they kitchen cause I be trippen'

[Chorus: Tragic Hero]
Oh yeah
We put in light
Night and day
They won't love us
'Til we runaway

(We can go anywhere you wanna go) (x2)
Does it ever get better
(I wanna run away)
Lord only knows
I'm packing my bags
(I wanna run away)
And I Land on the road
And I'm being told
(Anywhere I can stay up)
We can go anywhere you wanna go (x2)
(I wanna run away)
[Verse 2: Canon]
So hard headed but I wised up
Taught to shut up and just listen
Nate taught me to just act dumb, watch they gone give you that wisdom
Who gone try to teach know-it-all's
Talking bout how you get it
Shut up, How to heck you gone tell a man who done seen it all and been in it
So they Grab my collar
Rip the shirt
Aye tell that boy you gone get this work
Wisdom come it ain't everyday a young man a get what they learned first
And they Fought to Make a man from a boy
I was married to that adolescence then filed out for divorce
Of course
With my heart that a love these people (these people)
Sincerely I love these people (these people)
But I can get a lil' sick and tired of tryna be they perfect model knowing me and God ain't equals
I done lost my life to this yea
I gave up my right for this, yea
And That life on life done gave me that real deal to live right for him yeah
So don't be thinking I made it now (made it now)
Like I'm living all gravy, naw (gravy naw)
Bro I can't stress how much this life don drove me crazy now (crazy now)
I done put my faith up on display so some gone hate my message (message), me tryna shepherd and lead these people got me over stressing

[Chorus: Tragic Hero]
Oh yeah
We put in light
Night and day
They won't love us
Til we runaway

We can go anywhere you wanna go (x2)

Does it ever get better?
Lord only knows
I'm packing my bags
And I land on the road
And I'm being told

We can go anywhere you wanna go (x2)
