This current earth is full of hurt and worries
Saturated, losing hope of liberation
The music played on every station, is only played to play yo mind, it's just a play station
A Slave, never will I be
But no one is asking, how do I get that same joy some believers bask in
An entire world perfect, how shall I grasp it, When all I see is imperfection in the heart of masses
I'm not speaking too fast, you listen like molasses
Cause when it all falls down
That’s when I find my life in you
No John Dillinger with itchy fingers holding Triggers naw
A kid can go to school and not worry bout a bomb
Not a need to bear arms, no automatic to palm, no 30 caliber waiting to waste em you can disarm
You ain't Martian I ain't never seen you phone to home
Im running out of time
Running, running circles and I’m lost
So now I need to break away break
