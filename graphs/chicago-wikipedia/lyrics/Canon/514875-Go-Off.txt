But we know their hearts are broke
So use me now
In their pain of consuming
Cause Iâ€™m made for these moments
1989 man I popped out with a microphone
Man I Starting writing lyrics at 11
with a dream I'm a find my purpose, huh?
Tryna Come up with a feeling and lyrical rhythm like, "they ain't never heard of 'em"
Christ popped out I got Introduced for the first time it got personal
Brotha, Canon had a mind like 9 millimeter going off given truth to the masses
But he burned off relationships having no grace or no love he was passionate
But I changed up, same brother that got trained up
Loose Canon's got more rounds than AK coming
Straight out of Compton waiting to come with that hit, I'm Doc Dre
I'm warning em, follow the
Lucifer dawn of the morning or following the King and the Shepherd
like the number 11 He's crossing
Over
with my Bible, with this weapon
