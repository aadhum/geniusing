The track is titanium and I'm making it bend like aluminum foil
Been feeling like Jordan when going
I'm thinking that no one can stop me
Tell the engineer they're gonna turn up the drums
What you know about the 808 under the 809
Makin' everybody jump?
under
I tell 'bout God and gather the misfits the feelings amazing
Till kids beat themselves never mind their priors
Listen to God only, never mind them liars
