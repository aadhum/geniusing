Givin' you somethin' to twist up
Lift up and breath in,
Elevate you like smoke that broke through heaven's gate
This ain't easy but I'm steady gettin' my elbows greasy
Puttin' my back in it
Your armor no match for me. Understandably so
My enterprise identifies the city skies and urban manifestos
Rose up through the chaos to shake plots and pose
Visions enclosed in a globe spinnin', I'm seein'
Be out in my satellite capturin' sight that your eyes couldn't fathom
You know your armor no match for me. Understandably so
