Kids and drugs, a bad combo
Kids and drugs, overdose
Kids and drugs, say it louder
Kids and drugs, I know
Kids and drugs, a bad combo
Kids and drugs, overdose
Kids and drugs, say it louder
Kids and drugs, they know
Ay, Molly, liquor, weed, I want all of that
Drown in Hennessy
I need
Kids and drugs, a bad combo
Kids and drugs, overdose
Kids and drugs, say it louder
Kids and drugs, I know
Ay, Molly, liquor, weed, I want all of that
Drown in Hennessy
Money and drugs
Drowning in liquor
I'm sipping it all just because
Give me a buzz
Give me a rush, man
Pour me another
Roll me another
Give me another
Kids and drugs, a bad combo
Kids and drugs, overdose
Kids and drugs, say it louder
Kids and drugs, I know
Ay, Molly, liquor, weed, I want all of that
Drown in Hennessy
