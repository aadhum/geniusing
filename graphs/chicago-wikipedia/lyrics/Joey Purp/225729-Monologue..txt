Purple
Chance pass me the ball
Vic with the assist
Your bitch fixed me a dish
I told her I drive a Caddy
She said, "that bitch dented"
Your ex-man drive an Audi, ma
That bitch rented
Hands on the head let the wind make the whip swerve
I just want to get to see your O faces
But really she deserves a standing O
Hit it in the shower
In other words a standing O
Now SaveMoney like a new religion
Now SaveMoney like a new religion
And she say "Now SaveMoney like a new religion"
Now Baby let me give your place a face lift
If you don't have taste I'm not trying to taste it
And I know that joke was tasteless
But I'm just tired of dealing with these hoes thats basic
Young nigga shopping out the catalogue
My life like a movie but turn the cameras off
Soon as we hit the bedroom, she turned the camera on
Junya Watanabe, Nakamura, my designer on
Sushi roll with brown rice flow
This shit kinda raw (Let that run)
Save Money in the house
Save Money in the house, uh
Save Money in the house
