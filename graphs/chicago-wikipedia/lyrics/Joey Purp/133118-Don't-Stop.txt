Some of that real shit, nigga
Some of that trill shit, nigga
Young purple, Savemoney y'all
Chitown: where the conflict get crucial, that's where we are
Where the GDs and the BDs and the PRs and the DRs
Send yo ass to the DR
Need an MD,
Play basketball with y'all peons
It's only me that I lean on so
When blocka blocka's leave blocks vacant won't probably notice
For that proper profit your parish's pastor be probably bogus
You'll perish faster than parrots talking on top of shoulders
Cuz you're private property once that pirate ship hits the surface
And cannons loose around us
And lives lose around us
Mothers they never knew us
Gutters is where they found us
But hereby notice that sovereign soldiers may hit the streets patrolling
And they never pay us attention, no wonder why we're tolling
I'm Ayatollah
rolling up a half a zip
Rolling off a half a flat,
and Daniels Jackson, half a fifth
Half a step will leave you weak when shoes are made from problems passed
Past problems rumble, what's the jungle but a lions grass?
Probably tryna holler at a dollar off that Sassafras
Turtle time, have a glass
All these niggas beefing sounding corny with they cabbage ass
Dinosaurs to modern man
Cock it back and blocka blocka leave you lifeless where you stand
But that's the, start of all that real shit. nigga
Young Purple
Savemoney
And despite the fact cats calling us all the New Tang
I guess that's just what happens when you're on top of the food chain
do the dishes
My interventions are intermissions to intuition
This little mission gon' be complete in a little minute
Until then just listen
And me and Chance the hottest niggas out without a deal
Niggas handing tapes out, swearing they shit be hot for real
Went from zero to sixty and I ain't even got the wheel
Feeling like an early drizzy
This whole game concept ended soon as I showed up
But even if it is shots that you wanna throw up you better be sipping more than gatorade when
Sipping water, I'm off the cola
Sipping water, I'm off the cola
Youngest in the game, I must be sounding like Yoda
And It's been a while since I rolled up
So watch how you're twisting your fingers and what you throw up
Everybody spit sick, your mouths smelling like throw up
No deal, niggas can't deal with me
No ice, niggas can't chill with me
And on the realest of reals it can get real iffy cuz the same wild niggas I grew up with are still with me
Savemoney y'all
