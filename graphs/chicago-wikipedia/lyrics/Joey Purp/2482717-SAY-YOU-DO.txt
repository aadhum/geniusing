You with yours, I'm with mine
What's your name and your sign?
And we know we both creeping
Ayy, but we know we don't mind
Tryna say something, get you in the mood
Fat ass, tryna see what that do
Out of town but you full of that juice
And everybody know who you are
Been asking but don't nobody know who you are
Say, Sunday morning, you a good girl
Saturday night superstar
And you've got church in the morn
I hope you don't look worse in the morn
I ain't take you for a Christian
'Less we talking 'bout Louboutins
Fucking with your shoes still on
Seven days later and it's onto the next dude
And you thought that she was someone so special
Fall in love with who you fall asleep next to
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
And you're still in the mood
A few drinks in you now and you're feeling the mood
Tryna keep an A-list nigga by your side
But them B-cup titties, that just wo
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't love me like you say you do
