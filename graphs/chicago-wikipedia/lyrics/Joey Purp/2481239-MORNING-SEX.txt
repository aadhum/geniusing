Purple!
Uh, yeah
Uh, I done been on both sides of the burner
I done witness both sides of the murder
I done seen a nigga killed, and seen a nigga kill a nigga
Look in the mirror all I see is the money
I close my eyes all I see is the money
I done witness both sides of the murder
I done seen a nigga killed, and seen a nigga killing a nigga
Tell me how you feel, I'll show how it feel to see a homicide
Look in the mirror see myself in my mama's eyes
Drive-by the drive-through
Where the con in probation
I pop a toe tag and buy the bag for you
Hope when your friends they don't money Mitch you
You getting money, then they quick to Ace you
And pray for severance and the judge's graces
I'm playing spades with all aces
Look at my hands and see all faces
I'm trying to die alive
And if he says his heart kind, know that man a lie
Still feel all his ill feelings in his diatribes
Counting bucks still slave to the money
Folks told me it ain't nothing for a flock to land
Hold the steering wheel the wood grain
Penicillin in the wounds of a villain
