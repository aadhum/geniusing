Uh, I'm sick of waiting, I'm sick and tired, I'm sick, I hate it
I'm sick of outside opinions, I just ran out of patience
I'm sick of writing these raps, stuck in this fucking basement
Knowing you the best and they telling you just to be complacent
I'm tired of fickle fans, don't understand my new direction
I'm sick of people too closed-minded to view progressions
My nigga just had a baby, his baby mama crazy
He bought her houses, new clothes and even a new Mercedes
All they ever do now is argue about who fucking lazy
Who he creeping with, where he going and who he texting lately
My nigga got two jobs, and still he gotta hustle
(I'm right back)
I remember slaving away with a 9 to 5
Bad enough, I've been stuck in a fucking dead-end job
My boss is telling me I decide to show up late one more time
I'mma be filling out applications, nigga, you must be high
When you was hiding in the back when this bitch ass got robbed
You fired me over nothing but five minutes of time
(Let me keep going)
They wanna fire the teachers, policemen and the preacher
I guess religion is useless and education evil
The system just made a victim out of innocent people
Set us up for failure and teaching us that we not are equal
What if they close the police stations and the fire stations
And the school is shut down and politicians' buildings vacant?
(I got this)
If I see the day when they bury me or my casket closed
And could look down at my funeral while my spirit rose
I wonder if I would be remembered as a sinner or saint
Or just another dead young nigga, victim to bullet holes
If I don't make it, or if they take me before my time
I rest assured that through these lines, I'll be still alive
