Where all the girls at?
With the credit cards and the high heels
The Mercedes Benz with the big wheels
When they hear this jam, they can't sit still
With the Birkin bags and the big house
The Mercedes Benz with the tits out
Polo socks, Polo tee
Polo bed, Polo sheets
Photo booth, hoes with me
She takin' photos of me
That she carry all around like rosaries
She say she never did it with the lights on
Baby we gon' see
She SoCal, she NoHo
She know Smoke, she know Towk
She know Chance, she know Vic
Where your heels? Where your clothes?
Wear your hair in a bun when you head back home
Where your purse? Where your phone?
Where all the girls at?
With the credit cards and the high heels
The Mercedes Benz with the big wheels
When they hear this jam, they can't sit still
With the Birkin bags and the big house
The Mercedes Benz with the tits out
When they hear this jam, they turn the lights out
Yeah they know what's up
Where all the girls with the book in the club?
With the readin' glasses on, gettin' shook in the club
Readin' Ta-Nehisi Coates,
hummin' SpottieOttieDope
With the "why I let 'em drag me here?" look in the club
I need a ride home and I need an iPhone
Charger and your number, can you put your shit in my phone?
Damn my phone died, can you put it in my man's phone?
Damn his car died too, can you drive my mans home?
Where the girls in the club with the black dress?
With the big fat booty and the flat chest
Who tryna wear the black dress to my address
Where the tall girls at? You bad!
Where the small girls at? You bad!
Where the mid-sized girls? Where the mid-sized girls?
Where the mid-sized girls? You bad!
Where all the girls at?
With the credit cards and the high heels
The Mercedes Benz with the big wheels
When they hear this jam, they can't sit still
With the Birkin bags and the big house
The Mercedes Benz with the tits out
Codename Cold James
And she's Destiny's Child when she say my name
Lightskinned girl sippin' dark liquor
Got a darkskinned friend, only fuck white niggas
Black girls say they like girls, say they dyke girls
Type girls lose their boyfriends to them white girls
And this their favorite song
Turn this up when they turn this on
One more question, what y'all on?
Where all the girls at?
With the credit cards and the high heels
The Mercedes Benz with the big wheels
When they hear this jam, they can't sit still
With the Birkin bags and the big house
The Mercedes Benz with the tits out
Where all the girls at?
With the credit cards and the high heels
The Mercedes Benz with the big wheels
When they hear this jam, they can't sit still
With the Birkin bags and the big house
The Mercedes Benz with the tits out
