All I hear is money and bitches and 20-inch spinners
I ain't been to church in a minute, my Jesus piece flicking
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
Riding in the whip and it's stolen and plus my licence suspended
If they catch me, seven or ten is my minimal sentence
They taught us to value possesions, obsess with expenses
They taught us accept your position, the bottom'll fit you
It don't cost a dollar to listen, I hope you pay me attention
Man, this the point that we making, it's easy to miss it
They taught us that hooping and rapping is all we invented
They taught us to speak your opinion and get you arrested
And we grew up being neglected by our elected officials
They say life's a bitch
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
Started talking all this water, it penetrated the culture
Most so dislocated, you don't even need a CAT scan
To see it these days
ain't no games to be played
Hit your girl with a parabola like, "Will you behave?"
It's only linear equations, we straight, ain't tryna kick it
Ain't really tryna get between your legs, bitch, this ain't no East Bay
Less promethazine and a little more Morgan Freeman how they lean on me
the essence of ebony
It ain't no magazine on me
Keep it thorough, give a fuck how it must come off
That's on my soul, fam, it don't rub off
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
It don't cost a dollar to listen, pay me attention
