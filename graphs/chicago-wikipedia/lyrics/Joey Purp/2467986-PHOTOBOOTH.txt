They call me young purple, young Jimmy, young Rasta
Big Willy, bitch call me
big papa
I'm just a product of integration
Call immigration all my relations is interracial
These niggas old, they carbon dated, these niggas fossils
These niggas fake and these niggas actors, they need an Oscar
these bitches leeches
these niggas sponsors
He pay the car note, I finger fucked her all in the Mazda
The pimp died and the nigga still sipping
Fall asleep and woke up leaning and the nigga still tipping
And the only thing I never really need is your opinion
If the devil wears Prada than my bitch been sinning
They say we different, they say we different, they say we changed
They say a lot when they see us, they never say a thing
They say we changed, they say we changed, they say we different
I'm up in Barneys
I'm going Scottie
I took a Xan it got me woozy on the plane man
I'm trying to fuck the stewardess before the plane land
She got my number and my Instagram name cause
She ain't really bad, she a photo thot
She'll fuck a nigga off the gram for a photo op
She ain't really bad that's the photo shoots
Had her on the camera going down in the photobooth
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I seen it always
The cameras flashing, they caught us fucking up in the hallway
We holding pistols, we taking pictures fuck what the law say
It's still west, west, west, west side
All day
They say a lot, but I noticed they never say a name
I'm going Scottie, I need a moment
I took a molly, got me geeking on the plane man
I'm trying to fuck the stewardess before the plane land
Her ass stupid, dumb, retarded on rain man
She ain't really bad she a photo thot
She'll fuck a nigga off the gram for a photo op
She ain't really bad that's the photo shoots
Had her on the camera going down in the photobooth
