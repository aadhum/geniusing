Purp's back, have a heart attack
Money in the stroller where my daughter at
Burners in the pillowcase in case a nigga ever call for that
And I get it jumping like they kicked it off a corner, I'm a forward this a soccer match
SaveMoney money gang, fuck er I'm a part of that
I ain't never stop for no police me and my niggas dippin'
Bitch I think I'm Tim Leary
Bitch I think I'm balling I go Scottie Pippen
Hotter than the heater in the summertime
I could make the summer blind
I could give the Sun a tan
Least the one you couldn't be
I got a thought for every cell on your brain
Know that wave coming, Wave Theory coming soon
Heads hollow, pumpkin, they lack substance
After the band, before the bands I never really went solo
I always kept a cup of niggas with me
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Knew I was the future before the present
Questioning if I should move out of the city
Ain't really much left to do here, but I'm still here
You all look like dotted lines from the plane window
I shattered my silence in 2013
Now it's 2014, I was 2015 when I was 15
You probably just behind me you're sloppy seconds
This is a walk in the park for me
Head on crash turned my mom's whip to a pretzel
Thirty thousand went through my elbow, that's electric
Did the INNANET,
I'm the running back
SaveMoney back
Standing with my fucking shirt off, I got that still alive on my chest
