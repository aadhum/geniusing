That's uncool like your mother's brother
Might buy a chain that look like it was made for Master P
Been a problem now I'm more focused
I get up out my Yeezy boosts
The Godbody only speak the truth
Double cut sippin' paint drippin' off the Caddy frame
Two tone whip change colors, I call it Charlemagne
Cherry Rover
Seats the color baking soda
next
Ray Liotta
I'm good with that yay like Mike Dean
Killers turn police for that break like Ice T
Desperate niggas turn on they own people like Spike Lee
