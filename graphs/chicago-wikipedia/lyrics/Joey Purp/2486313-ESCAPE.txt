This shit sound like the summer's gone
And all the bitches and parties left at the summer homes
And all the niggas with burners that left the safety off
And kids turned statistics that's left here when the summer's gone
This shit feel right, ooh, this shit feel like
Jordan for 40 at 40 to let you know he's still Mike
All the thots that turned into good girls with a mad type
Who let me fuck before their relationships and they still might
This feels crazy, yeah, this feels different
This year's crazy, yeah, this year's different
This here, baby, yeah, this here's different
I had to wake them niggas' sleep up, had to clean the streets up
So please make sure you use my name if you addressing me now
[Chorus: Choir & Knox Fortune]
I put my heart and my soul in this shit,
They tried to wish me gone, I'm back on my Derrick Rose
This shit feel like a first communion, SAVEMONEY union
Uh, my niggas looking for different bitches
I'm in the bigger business, focused on the bigger picture
I've sold crack, I'll be damned if I can't sell a rap
