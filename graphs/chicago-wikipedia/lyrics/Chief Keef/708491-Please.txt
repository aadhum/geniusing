Double cup me please
I just rolled a blunt, give me a fire please
I got 50 in the thing, won't hesitate to let it speak
Choppa presidential, come through, give a speech
Where the restroom, cause my chain gotta pee
Call my Sosa Wonder I'm gettin' money and I ain't gotta see
Bitch came gave me top now she gotta leave
Gettin' money, yeah thats rad for your health
I come through super ridin' cool with the whip
And I ain't bool wit y'all, I'm bool wit myself
