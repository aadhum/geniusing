You drunk bitch, why this bitch don't want me
Glo boy, I been with it since jump street
Right when we was selling D, right there on Front Street
You drunk bitch, what bitch don't want me?
I just had a six some, them hoes was acting country
Thots ugly
Told all her friends now them hoes wanna fuck me
I'm can't go shawty
A nigga try and rob me he'll be brains blown shawty, oh
.40's
And all I ride is 'Raris
I'm sittin' on some Forgis
Cause I'm a cash cow
Bitch I be high off the earth, she hit my weed, she passed out
