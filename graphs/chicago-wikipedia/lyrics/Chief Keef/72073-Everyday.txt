She say you be stunting bitch that's every day
She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day
Every day, every day, every day
She wanna chill with Sosa but not every day
I be smoking dope shit, that's everyday
3hunna swole, bitch we be up in the place
Don't care what you say, shit that's everyday
Sosa always with this nigga shit, that's everyday
Can't compare to I, cause I'm hot as fuck
I'm buying foreign cars and some tonka trucks
No snitching boy we light you up
Shoot them bullets, ain't nobody hot as us
I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday every day
I'm a Leo but my fucking birthday everyday
She say you be stunting, bitch that's everyday
All my money go on dope, shit that's everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
Fuck on any nigga bitch, shit that's everyday
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
She wanna chill with Sosa, but not every day
OTF, bitch I rep that shit like everyday
GBE, bitch I rep that shit like everyday
If you think it's chicken then its bombs away
Ringing down your block, make you run away
Man I get so high I can't pronounciate
Run up in your house where your money safe
We be making moves, shit that's everyday
I don't stack money, I spend it in every way
Up all day,
40 on my hip, click clack then fire
We don't do this everyday, you's a damn liar
