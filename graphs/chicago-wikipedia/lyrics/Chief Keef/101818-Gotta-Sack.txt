You can’t turn me down
‘Cause this is that loud
Just for a fact, now
I got a sack now
I love to stunt, bitch
I act a ass, now (x2)
Since I got a name, you can check my background
Can’t put that mack down
‘Cause I’m stacked up, try to rob me and get clapped down
Got 300 guns, blow at your block
I’m a young nigga
We ‘bout that bullshit
Like D. Rose
Call numbanine,
free D-Rose
