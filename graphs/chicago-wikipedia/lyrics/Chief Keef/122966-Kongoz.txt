Kongoz, them guns sound like kongoz
My jits do this for fun, hoe
And they love letting guns blow
Kongoz, she twerk it to the kongoz
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
Kongoz, them guns sound like kongoz
My jits do this for fun, hoe
And they love letting guns blow
Kongoz, she twerk it to the kongoz
God, y'all some broke boys
Should've worked at the carnival
You ain't getting buzz, boy
Should've worked at the carnival
