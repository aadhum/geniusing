Like fuck the Feds
They mad cause a young nigga made it and got ahead
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
That's not fair, I made it up outta there
I put her in the whip, she like "oh lawd"
She hit my dope, it knock her out like Floyd, oh lawd
Pockets fat like ass on contour
My pockets fat like the ass of Kim K, oh lawd
Car I'ma drive today, oh lawd
Remember when I ain't have nothin' before
Now I can have it all
Problem is that I won't stop 'til I fall
Don't care bout none of y'all
