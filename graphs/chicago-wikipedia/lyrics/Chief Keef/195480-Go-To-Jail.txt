All these niggas talk like they trap gods
Talkin like they so hard they ain't never sold hard
And I know that I'm a rapper, I can have thirty niggas up in your yard
And I sip too much damn lean and you would think I always had a cold
And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it
I'm like what you touch that for
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol
Cause I don't wanna have to blow, yeah
Cause I don't wanna have to go to jail
I'm high as fuck like oh well
Shootin' shit like ho them
Said he know me I don't know him
I'm flexin' on these niggas no gym
Got indicted sellin' coke and sellin' dope
I don't want to do that shit no more
But you can come sell it for me though
Don't tell nobody on me though
I don't wanna have to move to Puerto Rico
And change everything on my ID though
Cause I'll never snitch on my 'migos
Cause when I bought 6 from him he gave me 4 more
Don't stalk me now, got a Glock on me now
Wish a nigga would try to follow me, BOW!
The block hot the cops hot
Finna go to New Orleans to the Mardi Gras
She a hot thot she was already dropped
I'm tryna see if money love me or not
But I think money love me alot
Try to take my shit, let the chopper flop like gra gra gra gra
Chopper going for em like raaaa raaa
Like ahhh ahhhh ahhhhhh
All these niggas talkin' like they trap god
Until they ass get robbed
