[Intro]
Ridin' wit my chopper
I'ma beat him like his father
Now there's blood on my Giuseppe's
Fuck he say, the fuck he say?
Fuck that nigga say?
Ridin' with my chopper
I'mma beat him like his father
Now there's blood on my Giuseppe's
Put a knife up on my tec
Little FaceTime little Skype up for my tech
blast his ass then forget
I'm not saying what I did
Look at my watch Johnny God damn
We are smokin' out
Catch him in an open field that's an open fall
Flexing like Dave the barbarian
Smoking swishers
Counting money getting blisters
All red right now I'm no Clifford
Cause I'm a dog, when it comes to fucking bitches
Cooling with my fans and taking pictures
I'ma a pistol fuck them niggas
Your squad on D get em up little nigga
