Higher than Jack and the Bean
Bitch, now I'm back poppin' beans
And I ain't mixin' that with the Lean
Shit ain't sweet like now and later
(Now and later)
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker, thot breaker
Heart breaker, thot breaker
Bitch I'm a heart breaker
Now and later, your bitch on the table
Goin' up like elevators, running up escalators
Clubbin' on big ass trees
Higher than Jack and the Bean
But all these bitches love Sosa
I'm about 30 thousand dollar loafers
I fuck that bitch like she was Pinky
Then I'm gettin' brain on the plane
I'm 24 should be in college, man
