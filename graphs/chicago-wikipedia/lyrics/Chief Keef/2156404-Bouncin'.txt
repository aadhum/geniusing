I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it
I talk all this shit cause I'm bout it
You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin'
Call me baghead Milonakis
All I get is bags, all I get is money
I up this 40 Mayweather, it's a damn knock out
*Mumbles*
I ain't make it in school, Chief So was a drop out
Something something something, I forgot now
I'm Sosa Ray Charles, you can still get knocked down
I think my chopper gay, I pulled him out the closet
I call my chopper Ye' cause' he half went to college
I think my Mac wanna be a rapper, we be touring
Like Kobe, Shaq, D.Rose and Butler, we be ballin'
I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it
You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin'
Call me baghead Milonakis
All I get is bags, all I get is money
pull up, get that check then I'm in to win
Bitch came to my crib, you know she eatin' this
She can't have her phone, hoes be leaking shit
I wasn't good in science but I knew my numbers
I up this fucking pistol then I cock it, I pop it
You want beef? I got Criscos, we can get it poppin'
Call me baghead Milonakis
All I get is bags, all I get is money
