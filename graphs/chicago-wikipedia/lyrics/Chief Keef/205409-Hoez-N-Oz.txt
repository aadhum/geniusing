Hoes and Oz
Bitch how don't you know
It's in the air this L-O-U-D
I don't like sober
I'm off the lean I'm falling over
I fucked his bitch, she like to smoke
You dumb bitch, you gotta go
He spilled his act 'pon my shoes
These ain't no jordans, bitch these balenciaga
Smoking out this pound nigga I don't smoke skinnies
Ride pass me, niggas mad cause my truck cost a Lamboghini
Getting top by a wanna be Lady Gaga but she got an ass like Nicki
I'm in a party, won't you come see me
She like do I gotta bring my weed with me
I'm like hell nah bitch you know I be chiefing keef
She like haha you mean to me
Bitch I'm Chief Sosa Houdini
