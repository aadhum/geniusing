Live life like it's no tomorrow
This cash ill throw it all, I said shawty make it clap
But you got to make it jiggle
got to make it clap
Girl I'm Ballout I got racks on top of racks
Everybody knows Ballout got a bag. (Got a bag)
I used to be on the corner, pushing packs (YEA)
Now every time you see me I'm throwing stacks. (Racks)
In the strip clubs, poppin' bottles, throwing sacks. (Racks)
Broke ass niggas can you boys handle that? (Naw)
