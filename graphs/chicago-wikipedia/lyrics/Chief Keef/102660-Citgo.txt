GBE the squad, it's just us, we don't need nobody
Yea.. yea... yea.. Sosa baby
Said Tadoe off the molly he spazzing out in the party man
All these bitches, know I get dough
Pop a nigga soul like crisco
I’m smokin on the gas like Citgo
Fat ass on my bitch though
Big rims, on my whips though
30 clips, all my clips go
You talk a lot but you ain’t on shit though
We let off shots, you ‘bout to get hit though
I’m Southside, I’ll pop out
OBlock bring them Glocks out
300 bring them chops out
We shoot up your block now
Fredo bring them Glocks out
Reese bring them crates out
I'mma bring them racks out
Make your bitch wanna stay out
But don't think she gone get paid now
I just like to play round
With niggas I don't play round
My boys shoot up the playground
So please don't get sprayed now
Sirens on the way now
Shoot you what you say now
Cause I got lots of commas
Louie and Ferragamo
This why I'm so stuck up
High off earth I'm fucked up
Bankroll got me puffed up
She got a fat ass then you know that I'mma fuck her
Tadoe off the molly
He spazzing out in the party
GBE the squad
Its just us we don't need nobody
And these bitches call me papi
Cause I got lots of money
It's a OBlock parade
We love drummin and bitch we coming
You better love your woman
Cause Sosa fuck any woman
These commas steady coming
I turned nothing into something
I be tired as hell
But my dick won't sleep for nothing
And we love getting money
I swear we won't sleep for nothing
See opps we pull our Glocks out
Hollow tips pop out
30 clips stick out
But please dont get shot down
On the plug i'll flood your block out
Disrespect my block now
Guarantee you get shot down
Choppas chop your block down
