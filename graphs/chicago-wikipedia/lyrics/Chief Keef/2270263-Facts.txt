You can be Debo, who's gonna get the hit
You can keep the roses bitch it's guns & dreads
Aye lil nigga where's the money
You thought I was a lil dummy?
I got association with money
I was riding down vine, going fast and sipping muddy
Sipping all this damn drank
I don't gotta piss or nothing
If you cannot fix your mouth my boys come through fix yo tummy
You like Pac up in Juice
Nas be in
Got 15 for a show hell nah that's too petty
It's getting hot in here but I do not be with Nelly
I know I don't speak English bitch, all I speak is Fetty
I ain't never lackin' bitch all I be is ready
Yo bitch ain't tryna go she get that boot, call her Betty
I ain't finna call that bitch no Uber, call a Taxi
