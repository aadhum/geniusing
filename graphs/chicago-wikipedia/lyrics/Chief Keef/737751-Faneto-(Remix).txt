[Intro: King Louie & Chief Keef]
Gang in this bitch

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm a gorilla in a fuckin' coupe, finna pull up to the zoo, nigga
Told you, nigga, who the fuck is you? I don't know, nigga
No, nigga, pull up on your block, we gon' blow, nigga
Go, nigga, run, nigga, run from the po', nigga (police nigga)
Gas what I smoke, nigga
Feds at my door, jump out the window, nigga
Know you can't get no money silly ho
I just hit a stain, faneto, faneto
Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Young Bibby, I be thumbin' through that check, bitch
Thumbin' through that check
Thumbin'-thumbin' through that check, bitch

Aye, sell some weed, sell some coke

Aye, you better run, Forest go
[Hook]
I bet I look like a stain, faneto
Bitch, I got 30 in my thang, plus 3 more
Walk up on me strange, watch me blow
Iâ€™m still lil heroin, fuck the lake and fuck the fo'
90's baby but I got crack like the 80's
So watch just watch how I do them this summer
Pull up on them corners like, bang, bang, bang
[Hook]
Bitch you know who King OVO
My name is Louie, but they call me Tony
Back-to-back hits on the foreign
Extended mag, might not have to reload
Take a nigga chain then wear it
Pass it to the gang now we sharing
