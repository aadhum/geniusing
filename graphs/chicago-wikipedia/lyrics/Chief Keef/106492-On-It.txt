Tryin’ to be Sosa, this ain’t no race, though
I got guap, tell your bitch to get on it
All this dough, rockin’ to the top, yeah bitch, get on it
She on it, she see me, she on it
We the Get Money team, you can’t get on that
BMG, I put the whole world on it

I got guap, tell your bitch to get on it
All this dough, rockin’ to the top, yeah bitch, get on it
She on it, she see me, she on it
We the Get Money team, you can’t get on that
