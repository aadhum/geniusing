Kush to face, that's the antidote
Cops pull us over, don't panic ho
Hey, hittin' home runs just like Sammy Sosa
I'm smokin' dope, you smokin cantaloupe
You smokin' watermelon, you smoke fruit pack
My breitling better than your Rollie
Who you? I don't know you!
Glock on me, turn your ass to tofu
Turn your ass to Thai food
Do a drive-by by you
Hit you aye, guarantee won't miss you
Boy I know your momma's gonna miss you
And kiss you, give her a tissue
Time to pull up on the opps get our pistols
Niggas too old, I swear these niggas too grown
I'm too young, with all this money
Ain't no talkin'
You knew that the coppers lurkin'
They lookin' for Almighty
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's almighty
Money in my right and left and back pocket
Hey all these bitches polly pocket
All they want is all me pockets
I just told them thottie stop it
I just told them thottie pop it
You got some lips, what can you do with them?
Can you handle this pipe?
I'm rollin' off a flat too
Bitch you know what a flat do
