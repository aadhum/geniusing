I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my Rari, kicking shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
I come through in my Audi, chopping shit like Jet Li
She see my neck piece, now she wanna molest me
And I'mma let her do it
break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me I kick that bitch like Jet Li
[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
My life a movie, Kung Fu movie
Bitch don't wanna do me
I kick that bitch like Bruce Lee
I'm with Chelsey, smoking on this QP
And If she don't do me I kick that bitch like Bruce Lee
She gon' regret me, regret that she ain't let me
Kick that bitch to the curb, to the curb Jet Li
She see my ear piece, my wrist piece, my neck piece
Johnny Dang ice on, he chopping shit like Jet Li
I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my Rari, kicking shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
I come through in my Audi, chopping shit like Jet Li
She see my neck piece, now she wanna molest me
And I'mma let her do it
break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me I kick that bitch like Jet Li
Bitches stand and applaud, how I talk nigga
I be off the shits, can't shit upset me
I come through in my Rari, kicking shit like Jet Li
Hop in my Bentley, please do not tempt me
I come through in my Audi, chopping shit like Jet Li
She see my neck piece, now she wanna molest me
And I'mma let her do it
break a bitch like Jet Li
Jet Li, yeah bitch Jet Li
If that bitch don't respect me I kick that bitch like Jet Li
