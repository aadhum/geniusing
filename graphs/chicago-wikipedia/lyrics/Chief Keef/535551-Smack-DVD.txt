Sosa on the beat
Sosa on the beat
Chief Sosa back, I hate to even say that I'm gone
I'm overflowing, bitch you just a weak leak
I'm an overgrown lion, you a weak peach
the beef shop
I hang with a lot of fucking killers (gang, gang)
And if you disrespect my niggas
Respect with the TEC my nigga
Young snake cross the line you a tweak T (you a snake)
You MC? What it be B?
Pistols come through wet your surface, street leak
The fire hydrant? No nigga big beef
Sosa on the beat
