They like "Damn Sosa, where you fit that cash at?"
Throwin' all this cash up, bitch, you can have that
Don't try and grab that, this pistol I'mma blast that
I heard you got a hard head, shootin' where your ass at
I get that cash back, it's just like it's elastic
I'm a rich nigga, no pops, you a broke bastard
On Instagram, I make niggas imagine
How they be like Chief Sosa, "Where he get that cash at?"

You's a bitch nigga an boy you ain't no Soulja
I took a hundred thousand dollars and I dragged it
