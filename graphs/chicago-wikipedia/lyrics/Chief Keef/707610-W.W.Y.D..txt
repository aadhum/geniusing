It's an honor to be able to say that I'm from Chicago
What would you do, I came through with two tools
poled up
No Slow bucks, Glo bucks, O bucks
Green bucks, blue bucks
Come through,Ku Klux
What would you do
If I came through with rugers
If ya grandma house was a two bedroom
What would you do
If you left yo toolie knowing you snooze
I'm walking with my tool in a bad mood, what would you do
Pull up on an opp and let that bitch rip like duru-duh-duh
Scooterska-scooterska-scooterska duh-duh-duh-duh
Scooterska-duh-duh, scooterska-duh-duh, scooterska-scooterska
Pull up on an opp and that bitch rip like
Duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh
hood

Go where ya sky's at
