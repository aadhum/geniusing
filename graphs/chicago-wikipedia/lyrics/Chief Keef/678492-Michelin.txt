Know how we rockin' like cut off stockings
I just put a silencer on my gun
I'm just like a scavenger on a hunt
I'm rollin', I'm Almighty Sosa Michelin
God came and got me out and let a nigga in
I remember robbing white folks for they shit lil' man
They say 'How I get that?'
I told on my grandma, I get a damn check
And put it in that fast and then I sell it to those
green face my president
Hundred Franklins
'Member when I wore the same clothes for a minute man
Now a youngin' counting bank rolls, making millions
So much designer I might change clothes, True Religion
I do not like no Prada, wear Giuseppe with that
