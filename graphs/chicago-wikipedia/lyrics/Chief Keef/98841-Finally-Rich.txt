Intro
I know I'm finally rich
But ain't a damn thang gonna change
Me and my boys still bang (Bang Bang)
I could ride foreign cars (Skirrt)
I could smoke all the dope
Real nigga from the O (I’m finally rich!)
Me and you ain’t the same
All these niggas follow my campaign
And all these bitches knowing my name (bitch I’m finally rich)
I’m a O-Block nigga, can't change
64th street my domian, Savages
Take care of my daughter
And take care of my brothers
So just watch Sosa stack this cheddar (Sosa Baby)
Flexing and these niggas know better
Hate on me, it don’t matter (I’m finally rich)
I be flexing with my big bros Reese Money & Fredo
Every bitch know Chief Keef, every bitch want Chief keef
I got diamonds all in my watch,
horses all in my cars
I get 10 bands for a bar -- I know I'm finally rich
