I just pulled up in that old color of glue
They like Chief Sosa, "When we gone hit the stu?"
I'm like when you put the O on side the two
I know I feel like John Cena
Ain't no nigga seeing me
Tryna rob me they meet my damn Nina
Ain't a nigga getting a thing from me
Tryna blow nigga oh no
Cause I brought my thing with me
I feel like G.I Joe tho
I come from the meanest streets
Almighty Sosa from the O
Cause I got all this Johnny Dang on
Chief Sosa shiting on you lames man
And if you want a verse send my check in the mail
You niggas ain't gone shoot man you niggas gone tell
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the L
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the L
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the L
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the L
