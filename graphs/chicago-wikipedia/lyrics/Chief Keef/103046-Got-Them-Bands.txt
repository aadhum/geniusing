She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands (x2)
She know I got them bands (x2)
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance
Them bitches act like fans
Gettin' payed ever since
My daughter's heaven sent
She rock Gucci Louie shit (kay kay)
She be flexin' like a bitch
She know papa got that cash
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Your baby's mom let me hit
I just tell her blow all that
Couple stacks don't give me lip
Any bitch gone let me hit
My baby's mom let me hit
I just tell her blow all that
Couple stacks don't give me lip
I'm finessin' countin' bands
Got louie on my pants
I got gucci on my stomach
I got bands don't give a damn
I just splash (x2)
She know that I just splash
And you know I'm full of bands
Show that cash in my stash
Bitch I got plenty cash
And he think about robbing me
I'm gone let that semi spazz
You can't stand you won't last
You ain't ballin' like I am
And I stay countin' stacks
I'm ballin' like a gym
Finally rich ain't that a bitch
They gone let a nigga in
Gbe is the mans
And we be setting trends
Finally rich ain't that a bitch
They gone let a nigga in
Gbe is the mans
And we be setting trends
