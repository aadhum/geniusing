Remember posted the block stealing Hondas
Now I ride foreigns and Tonkas, stuntin'
Remember when I ain't have no money
Now I get money, get money
Get money, get money, get money, get money [x4]
I wear Moncler, Louie, Gucci I'm stuntin'
And my pants, they filled with money
I like blue cheese, blue cheese with my chicken and onions
I pull 'em out my pocket and I'm stuntin'
I'm talking bout them hundreds, them hundreds, them hundreds
I'm stuntin', I'm stuntin', It's nothin'
You got your Louie, where your cake?
Got your Gucci, where your cake?
You ain't got no cake, it's ok, it's ok
All I gotta say, go out and get the cake
Cuz If I can make it, you can make it any day
I wear Nike, Truey, when I ain't on nothing
I pull up fresh like I'm going to luncheon
That money need more I'm gon' find it
