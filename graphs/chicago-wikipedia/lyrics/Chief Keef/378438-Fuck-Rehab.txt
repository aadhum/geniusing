[Intro: Chief Keef]
Fuck rehab (x4)
Fuck rehab, just see shells
Fuck rehab (x3)
[Hook: Chief Keef]
(Oh, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah) Fuck rehab (x4)
[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bitch, I be smoking dope, what you mean?
Them bitches go "ping-ping!"
30 in this ning ding!
Fuck rehab,
rehab make me laugh
Bitch, I'd rather be up in jail,
getting a lot of mail!
Like "Almighty Sosa, that's you? Smoking on dope with your crew?"
You don't know me? What the fuck you talking bout?
Nigga, all I remember is selling dope out grandma house
Let me get them hitters, I'm coming out the cut, getting loud now
I could be on the block running 'round shooting shit up like Rambo
But the judge gonna lock me up for smoking a little dope (fuck rehab)
[Verse 2: Blood Money]
Who are you? Where are you from? Bitch, I'm a Glo, is you dumb?
Somebody cut out his tongue,
blow that four nickel with him
You might not have no more arms,
22k for my charm
Fuck is you doing? I'm money pursuing,
I'm probably some kin to Saddam
Too many uppers, I'm numb, too many uppers, I'm numb
See the Glo Gang and they run, see the Glo Gang and they run
Run up on every M.O.B. that I see, leave them with half of a lung
My migo just sent me a ton,
you owe me, I come for your son
Sosa'll buck, we might just go shoot up a club
That shit ain't gon' cost but a dub
