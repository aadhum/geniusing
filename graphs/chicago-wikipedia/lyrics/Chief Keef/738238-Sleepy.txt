I am sleepy, I am sleepy
I am sleepy, drank is sleep
But, I ain't gon' go to sleep, cuz I am greedy
Where that money, gotta get them ffff beep-beep's
Don't watch me, nigga watch T.V
Are you sleepy?, I am sleepy
I be up day and night, cuz I am greedy
Dope got me tweekin', xans got you sleepin'
Nigga, no sleepin', dope got me reekin'
Me, I talk money, that's what I be speakin'
Niggas diss sneakin
I don't like speaking, I don't want a feature
Bye, bye, Felicia
You's a fuckin' tweeter, me llamo Pistol Keeper
I'm ridin' with my heather, I'm a glo gang frontstreeter
I am sleepy, I am sleepy
I am sleepy, drank is sleep
But, I ain't gon' go to sleep, cuz I am greedy
Where that money, gotta get them ffff beep-beep's
Don't watch me, nigga watch T.V
Are you sleepy?, I am sleepy
I be up day and night, cuz I am greedy
