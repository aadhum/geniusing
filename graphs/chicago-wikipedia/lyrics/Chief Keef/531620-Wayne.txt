In that big body, riding two lanes
And I'm grindin hard like I'm fucking Wayne nigga
We pullin up in trilogies we poppin 3
I'm never studying a nigga no astrology
I can't be controlled this ain't no colosseum
I only speak money, dialectology
I'm examining money, you broke-a-ology
Pull up in a clean car, do em dirty
Yeah, Sosa Wayne, I got Young Money and Mack Maine
Pull up in that Cash Money thang
Nigga you be balding like you Stunna, bald head nigga
