I be riding foreign cars
Riding like it no tomorrow
I be spending hella bands
I be high above the stars
I be chilling with my dogs
Lotta pound lotta O's
Lotta of bankrolls and clothes
Lotta ice white and gold
Tats on my arms
Lotta Hoes on my line
I be touring fuckin hoes
Ben franklin bank rolls
LV's on my clothes
Jump man on my kicks
Don't like them gucci shits
And a lot of Fendi shit
Got ferragamo shit
Bitch I got plenty shit
I ball like it's no tomorrow
Bitch I'mma glory boy
All I know is go hard
Because I got a daughter
I think she got it from Ballout
You know we them bang brothers
Tadoe off the molly water
So you know it's no discussion
Bustin' like I'm Dillenger
Bitch I got Burberry on
I ain't with the drama I could fuck your mama
