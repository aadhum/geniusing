I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
Ay, I'm so damn ignorant I pulled out my ding-a-ling and start pee peeing
My wrist look like pee
My name is Keef
Roll it up and chief the weed
I'm so high I don't know my damn A-B-C's
Count it out like one two three
Four five six no these not G's
These hundred thousands bitch it's legal
Now my doors go up I remember stealing regals
I'm counting cash no I'm not sleeping
I ain't sleeping till two weeks from next week
This hoe gone fuck me cause my tweet
And I only tweeted if she wife she get a treat
I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
I  pulled out my dick and I pee'd
In public, I don't care no fuck who sees
My watch blinging it is freezing
Its the reason why I ain't hiding this heater
Sosa T-Pain let me buy you a drink
I ain't got to talk I hit her with that wink
Then she start telling me her favorite color's pink
When I was young my mom told me to go hard
Diamonds in my Glo man no Jesus piece
I put ice all on my body, I put money all in my pocket
I put square feet all in my house, got no reason to be rowdy
