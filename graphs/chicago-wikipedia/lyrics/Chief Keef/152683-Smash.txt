Know that I'm that nigga, follow me on Twitter
Two 50 shot macs, 100 shots for that nigga
Got a crazy loud affect, all you smell on me is kush
Bitch I'm rolling off a pill
Catch 8, like a hook
Man, my niggas we be swole
Ready to blow them poles
We on ready, set, go, we charge his ass like rhinos
Want beef? We turn up
And I'm screaming A.O.N
And blowing loud with DJ Kenn
And this purple smell like grass
And that green like some cash
We smash on niggas, blow kush on niggas
In a party off a pill, then we push on niggas
Bitch I'm out here with my hammer up
When cops come, my hammer tucked
And I'm all about my money stacks
So I gotta get my sandwich up
