I got choppers, I got gwala
I got partners, send you to the doctor
I got guns, singing like opera
And my partners, they got money
Bitch I'm 3hunna, my niggas riding
And now you're done, you couldn't wrestle
Bitches calling me, they want my time
But I'm chasing all this money runnin'
I got choppers, I got gwala
I got partners, send you to the doctor
I got guns, singing like opera
And my partners, they got money
Bitch I'm 3hunna, my niggas riding
I'm smoking ganja, I'm counting commas
I got my llama, so nigga don't try us
I'm blasting at you, I'm laughing at you
Cause you need to catch up
You full of mayonnaise, I'll let Nina red ya
You in the red line, that's the dead line
You ain't got my money on time
Then that's your head
mon
Bumbaclottin', Rasta-rockin'
Rastafari mothafucka, damn near lion
I got choppers, I got gwala
I got partners, send you to the doctor
I got guns, singing like opera
And my partners, they got money
Bitch I'm 3hunna, my niggas riding
