All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
All of my bling on
My watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on
All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
And my chain on
And my gwap on
Bitches all up in my phone
Im big from my chain to my arm
Pulled up flexin' on the low
snow
loan
I think that I'm Wayne,
big timers blang blang
Remember having rocks in my socks
Pull up smoking skunk to the skunk
Ayyy 110 in a 55 now running from the cops
