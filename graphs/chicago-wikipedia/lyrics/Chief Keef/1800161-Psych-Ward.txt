Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
40s with the 30s
You gon' need insurance, Geico, aye
In a Psych Ward you see
A bunch of anti-380 muthafuckas
And they gon' blast
Bitch, I'm Almighty Sosa
Bitch, you can call me Almighty Sosa
The only grand that I like is Ben Franklin, broccoli and cheese
Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
40s with the 30s
You gon' need insurance, Geico, aye
Don't make this pistol go insane
Don't ever tell Almighty what Almighty can't
I'm always glo'in
I blocked the ring
And Cinderella is my choppa name
She be cleanin' shit up like my maid
And tell me, what you bring a knife for?
Psych Ward
In'm with the Psych Ward
