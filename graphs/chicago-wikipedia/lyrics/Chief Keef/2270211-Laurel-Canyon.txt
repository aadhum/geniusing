Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang Bang (Sosa baby)
Gang gang
Bang bang (GBE baby)
I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
Paul Bunyan
when it's riot
Chain Gang, Ear Gang, Wrist Gang
You lookin' girl I know you see the wrist game
I ain't gotta talk, ain't gotta spit game
I let my chain hang, try to take it bang bang
Grind like I was Wayne
Gotta get that cash, bitch I'm getting game
Aye, pull up get that dub then I get back
In my car a nigga try to block me, he get shit bagged
I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
You talkin' shit but yo ass is funny
You taking shots Steph Curry, Paul Bunyan
But them skills ain't gon' help you when it's riot
I'm smoking weed, rollin' weed I'm blunted (Dope)
I'm in Cali ridin' through Laurel Canyan
I pull up reek of dope, ounces on me you ain't know
Sosa Marvin Gaye, hop out like let's get it on
Sosa Modern Day, Bonnie & Clyde down the road
Pull up Dominoes, get my pizza vamonos
Sosa Luciano,
Pull a $50 out my pocket and I blow my nose
I'ma sit gang crazy motherfucka
I come through reeking like some onions
Put a hole in ya, now yo ass a Funyun
You talkin' shit but yo ass is funny
You taking shots Steph Curry, Paul Bunyan
But them skills ain't gon' help you when it's riot
I'm smoking weed, rollin' weed I'm blunted (Dope)
I'm in Cali ridin' through Laurel Canyan
