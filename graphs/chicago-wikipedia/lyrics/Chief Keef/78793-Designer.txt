I got love for some designer x4
Parallel shit bitch don't get lined up
Bitch I'm tatted, I'm designer
Pop the kush, swisher blunts, rolling nothing but designer
Drinking fiji water, I call that designer
Parallel shit bitch don't get lined up
Ugh, ugh
Sosa in his prime huh
Yeah, I buy nothing but designer
Lotta kush, lotta blunts
[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
I-I-I'm true to my religion bitch so start praying
A hundred shots coming out that black van (blah!)
Van, bullets gon design ya (Murder)
I rock Gucci, Louie, Prada like the song say
My money don't fold up, I keep it long ways (ways)
