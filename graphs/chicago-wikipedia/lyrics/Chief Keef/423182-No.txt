I be smoking on jet lag
Don't think my jet landed yet
Steady texting my phone
Would you love me if my hair was gone?
If my hair was short or if my hair was long?
Would you love me if I didn't have the throne?
Would you love me if I didn't have a song?
If I didn't have mills would you still chill?
Would you still be cool as fuck like a windmill
