I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired
'member when i use to fantasize
You scared to go to church bitch, Kumbaya
Them pistols get to bussing, Boo-ya-ya
You ain't with the Glo Gang nigga, who are ya?
Steady texting my phone, this just bitch just blew my high
I walk in the mall and buy out all of these stores
Nigga came out with two bags he thought he was
Let a nigga try me, I got my Glock forty
It got thirty shots in it, it gon' make em scream
(SCREAM!)
Hey Sosa, why you so high?
I gotta get high, to balance my low
I'm moving too fast, I gotta pour a four
Spend lots of cash, 'member used to be broke
Sosa, what you got a gun for?
Cause I'ma shoot when I see my opponent
But hold up I gotta roll me a Dutch
