We just do our thing and the feds watchin'
Can't trust every face shit I gotta watch em
Chief Keef sosa I'm a known topic
We be in the club bitches so excited
Because we don't trust her with her mouth
de other night
We don't trust niggas, get out my sight
Folk ‘nem poppin’ pills and they startin' fights
Folk ‘nem poppin’ pills and they startin' fights
Because I'mma do me and take all light
Put your glasses on I'm comin' strong ight
Gotta get this bread for my newborn (KayKay)
In this shit, I done waited too long
Two face niggas, call em two tones
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic
Snitch niggas makin us the feds topic
