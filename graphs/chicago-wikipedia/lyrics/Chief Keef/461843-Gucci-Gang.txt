Free Wop,
aye Justo
Free my nigga Slick
Free, free my nigga you know
I need that
I pop X man
Dead mans in my pockets, and I spend all 'em
On 4,000 Gucci jackets
Fo a Gucci sweater 3,000... 3,000 Burberry
Riding fast the cops is chasing me
Cause I'm tired of getting locked up
That's the reason that officer got shot up
Bitch I go by Justglo
Niggas know I'm Glo
It's all about the Glo, Free D-rose
Who is you? I don't know
Move around, cock it back, I'ma blow, GRATATA!
My life Gucci and it's a movie
I got clips just like a fuckin' movie
Quentin Tarantino, with
these pistols I think I'm Terintino
Bitch I think I'm Godfather, off this dope Tony Montana
Now I'm finna hop up in my Rover
