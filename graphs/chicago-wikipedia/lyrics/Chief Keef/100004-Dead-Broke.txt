Some of my niggas dead broke (x3)
That leave your ass dead broke
Some of my niggas dead broke (x3)
That leave your ass dead broke
No flexing dog
It ain't no flexing dog
Some of my niggas dead broke (x3)
That leave your ass dead broke
See I be high as I wanna be, don't smoke that bubbly
I smoke that kush dog, and I smoke so lovely
See I'm in my Burberry, in my pockets a couple g's
Allergic to fake shit, get that shit the fuck from me
I'm allergic to fake niggas, get them boys away from me
D. Rose will flip something
Some of my niggas dead broke, that ain't no damn joke
They might kick a damn door
you run and you get smoked
Just like a damn Newport,
shots travel like passports
She only on me cause commas come
be good homie when drama come
I'm fly as a magazine
Bitch I'm no athlete but I score like I'm Dominique
Pockets is fat as Gleesh,
