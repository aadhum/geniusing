G-L-O-G-A-N-G
Money, we get plenty
Thots, we get plenty
Niggas can't come near we
I'm bout my money, all of that
Comin' through, Andy hit me like, ring ring, we got some racks
That's a lot of money on the table, you know we gotta get that
Lean back with the tool Fat Joe
Diamonds on me, they elegant man
Finna smoke some loud, I swear I can't hear you man
I be ballin' out, I think I'm Kobe Durant
Got more pints than a blood drive
Pouring fourths, this is mud life
Cut the tennis ball, hide the crack in it
People thought I'm actin'
