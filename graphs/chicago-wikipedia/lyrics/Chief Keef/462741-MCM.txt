But I dont wear no MCM (no I don't)
All I wear is Hermes when I do (I spend 15 bands)
But I don't wear no MCM (i don't wear no fuckin' MCM)
Bitch I'm cold bitch I'm sick got the flu (bitch I'm sick got the flu)
Hop up in my car and then I drive it
I mean I don't drive it I ride it fast
Put my feet to the gas
Smokin' on this gas
Put your shit in the trash
Shawty know that I'm the man
Seen my ice she like damn
Baby I dont need no fan
She seen my car she like damn
I don't fuck, bitch, don't let me down
