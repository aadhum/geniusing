Either way bitch I'm that nigga (I'm that nigga)
Either way I'm countin' figures (I'm countin' figures)
Either way I'm with my fuckin' niggas (I'm with my fuckin' niggas)
And either way we'll fuckin' get ya (either way we'll fuckin' get ya)
Either way I'm gon' get cake (the way I love you Kay Kay)
Either way I'm gon' get laid (either way I'm gon' get laid aye)
Either way I'm a fuck yo' bae (either way I'm a fuck yo' bae aye)
Either way she'll know my face (either way she'll know my face name)
Get this money either way
Gotta get this money either way
Got them bitches comin' either way
And this money comin' either way
And I'm money hungry either way
Dreads low, you can't see my face
Eyes low, I can't see the place
I'm smokin' dope, I can't feel my face
That was gone happen either way
My chopper Kimmy K, I nicknamed her Kimmy Karday
I remember sellin' coke girl I get booked for shows
â€˜Member some lil thots but my phone full of those
And a lot of guns bitch my home full of those
Either way, you get 8 shots out this Ruger nose
She wanna come to my house, I'm like girl no clothes
She wanna smell my gwoyop,
Smokin' on this loud, you smell me
You ain't smokin' loud, that's filthy
I take clean money and filthy
