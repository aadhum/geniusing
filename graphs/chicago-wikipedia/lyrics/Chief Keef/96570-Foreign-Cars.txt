I be kush smokin' car ride
She said she like how my car ride
I'm in foregin cars now
300 we some stars now
Buying out the bar now
Bitch I'm living large now
Got so high I see stars now
Bitch I'm in foreign cars now
A lot of tattoos on my arms now
Bitches wanna fuck my arms now
All I rock is Louie now
Truies and some Gucci now
Say Sosa life a movie now
When I come around it's a concert
The words go for 50 now
The verse go for 60 now
I gotta sleep next to a choppa now
Watch got the big face
I'm doin' shows for 250 now
