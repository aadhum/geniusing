Let me tell you something man
When you see a nigga like me
Look me straight in the eyes
Talk to me man, not at me
Just bought a brand new car, backed it straight in
Fuckin' up the club
Fuck with GBE, fuckin' with them gangsters
I ain't sweat her, she was comin' at my crew neck
pistol toter
Bands all in my pocket
My youngins get it poppin'
Now you on the news, they watchin'
Fuckin' with my gang, you goin' end up in violence
Fuckin' with Taylor Gang, you fuckin' with the pilots
Smokin' on this dope, thumbin' through the checks
Thots on my dick like who gonna do me next
I spent so many checks, I coulda bought a jet
GBE 'till I die, I do it for my set
Go Go
