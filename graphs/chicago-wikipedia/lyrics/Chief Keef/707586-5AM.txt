Used to be from O'Block, now I'm from that Glo Block
I still a let the tool pop , I shoot it at 4 opps
I don't go to sleep ain't gotta wake up in the morning
I be up trap trap trappin' while these niggas snorin'
I pull up blingin, chain from Johnny, watch from Johnny, ring from Johnny
Everything from Johnny, I pull up bling is stuntin'
On tracks I be flooring, weed I be blowing
My nina be so horny, she is full of porn
Got cake all on the floor, I ate some more
Cause I can't tell the time in my fucking Breitling
I'm from the block, I still wear white 1s
Let a freak me look like
Got a watch out for the iguana
