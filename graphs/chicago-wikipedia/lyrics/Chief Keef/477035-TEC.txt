Boy hold my jewelry it's a pound
Brick on my wrist right now
And I'm finna go and scoop ya bitch
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks
Finna pull up on my ex
Pull up on my ex make that bitch mad
"I ain't got no fucking type of respect
But I heard you get respect with TEC"
Roll up let's get high
Let 'em come up in this fucking house
Pistol to his motherfucking mouth
I told him "watch this motherfucking mouth"
My truck got a muscle
It ain't American, it's foreign
Didn't stop for nobody
Who told you to party? Not GloGang
Fuck boy you is a no name
I just bought a chopper let's do a hit
I got a .30 with a stick
These niggas hate but niggas bitches
These niggas tellin, niggas snitches
Talking numbers, hunnid rounds
When I kill you, Ima frown
Ain't no fucking laughing or playing around
