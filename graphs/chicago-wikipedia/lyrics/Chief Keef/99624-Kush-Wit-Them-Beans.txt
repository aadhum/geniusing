We got 40s on our waist, 30s and them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all this money on me, bitch I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me,
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding homie
I’ma go to the mall, I’ma buy that bitch
I’ma hop in my 'Rari and I’ma ride that bitch
I put Fendi on my belt, Robin all in my jeans
I don't wanna go to sleep, so I don't do that lean
Big knots in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet
I love bankrolls, I don't love these hoes
Fredo always ballin' then shoot up the party
And I be doing them mollys, I be high as a kite
