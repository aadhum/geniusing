I'm with my killers, smoke with killer
I made it rain on 'em on her cause I'm that nigga
O'Block afila, ain't it nigga
300 nigga, don't make them kill ya
Put your hands up if you hang with killers
You got that scrilla, you sold vanilla
Catch me on the block with them Normal killers
Cause we on top and we won't stop
Used to have rocks, in my socks
Ménage à trois, bitch and it's nothing
See she go suck me then here come the other one
And toast his little ass like he was Aiki
