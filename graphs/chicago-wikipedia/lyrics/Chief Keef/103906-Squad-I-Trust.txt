I swear I'ma keep it real, tell you how I feel
Only squad I trust, for the squad I bust
You be honest, be foreal, that's how you feel
I'm touring on my tour bus smoking la la la
I used to be broke, well not anymore
650 on my kicks
Because we the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
Because we the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
