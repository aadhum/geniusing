All in, All in
tossing
Heard you wasn't in line nigga fall in
I just left yo bitch and I got all in
All in, All in
paint
It's something that I know man
Hoes think I am Jamaican
Rastafari dreads, they be shaking
But I don't fuck with big, see them then I shake it
They gon' try to strip me naked
Take me to the cell, I can take it
