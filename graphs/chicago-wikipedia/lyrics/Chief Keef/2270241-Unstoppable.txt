My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Go in my closet pick some straps out the arsenal
I'm a blade call me Sosa Snipes Unstoppable
I'm smokin on this Tooka I'm on Pluto
I be doing me I ain't worried bout where you go
I ran through 2 milli but it's cool
I be stirring up that money making music
Off that Don't like and Love Sosa too
Play Faneto in the club they go coo-coo
I'm like Bang, smokin cali but with Snoop
I'm from Chiraq but Cali what it do?
My leather so soft, shells so hard
You wanna be a boss nigga go hard
Sosa Wesly Snipes got the blade
You know I'm from Chiraq got the K
I got Kool-aid, Lemonade
Only green I eat is Brocoli
With some Cheese get it out the way
All these fuck niggas mocking me
I'm like please move up out the way
Police walking up on me I be blowing smoke
In they face
Wanna lock me up cause I got dope, shit is gay
I be with that disrespectful shit any day
Try me Imma let the Tec blow anyway
