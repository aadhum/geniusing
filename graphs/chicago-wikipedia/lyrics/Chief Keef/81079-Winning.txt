I can't lose bitch , im so used to winnin'
Sosa bout that gun smoke
Smoke kush smoke you don't know
Ridin' round wit my young niggas
Young niggas that's gone blow
Smoke grade A honor roll
Playing Louie Im gang banging
Party rockin'
Ass shakin'
Ain't throwin' money
I'm showin' money
Bitches dont deserve that
They be already goin' for me
Young money ,
Gbe
2012 That's my year
Kush to strong with a thick bitch
She Like Chief Keef and play his shit
My young g's stay iron holdin'
Pink champagne and some golden
New Ray Bans let me unfold em
Bitches pop pills like ibuprofen
Niggas say they ballin' but I be coachin'
I love pussy but I prefer dome
Pack louder than a ambulance
