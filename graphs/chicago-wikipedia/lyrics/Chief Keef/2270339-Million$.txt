G-L-O G-A-N-G you know how we be
We be going wee
G-G-L-O you know we
Smokin' weed, I count cheese
Came through with that cash and that swag
Fuck a bag, put the racks in my pants
Catch you with the hammer, I don't dance
Big bank take lil' bank, stand down
I pulled up, million dollar cash down
'Cuz I got that sack now
All I talk is racks, all I talk is cash now
You not flexin', sit your ass down
What is you, a class clown?
Only language that I speak is million dollars cash down
Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars
Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars
You want me in your club, you gon' have to let the gang in
I pulled up, million dollar cash down
'Cuz I got that sack now
All I talk is racks, all I talk is cash now
You not flexin', sit your ass down
What is you, a class clown?
Only language that I speak is million dollars cash down
Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars
Million dollars, million dollars, million dollars
