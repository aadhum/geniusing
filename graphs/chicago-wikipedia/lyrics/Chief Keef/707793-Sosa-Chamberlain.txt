What is GLO GANG? Well it's GLO GANG is G-L-O-G-A-N-G
It is Glory Boyz, we are Glory Boyz Entertainment. It is GBE
But it's shortened, it's shortened, you know what I'm sayin'
So it's G-L-O Gang, and so the GLOry Boyz
You guys can say either one though, it don't matter
You know what I'm sayin'
I won't get offended, gang won't get offended
We are Glory Boyz, you know what I'm sayin'
But GLO GANG is just a, just a short abbreviation for Glory Boyz
You know what I'm sayin', just G-L-O-G-A-N-G, you know
She let me fuck up in the car, now my seats is wet wet
She said she wanna smoke with we, bitch you should've said that
She said that she gotta pee, I'm like bitch you should've said that
She said she been said that, I said I ain't hear that
I was smoking the loudest loud but I'm always ready
Who come here, you come here
Johnny call me up, he said he  pee'd on my wrist
she said she bleached all my gear
My daughter call me mad, she said she gon' eat all my chips
These niggas always mad they wanna eat all my dip
Until I come through blastin' like the Heat I ain't doin' shit
I'm Sosa Wilt Chamberlain, blunts just flamin'
Rocks just blingin', phone just rangin'
I'ma no belt rockin', no sock rockin'
Pull up show stopper, you know how I'm rockin'
I came in the game man, and you know I changed it
My favorite player Butler, and I gotta butler
Gotta number 40, my 40 a fuck ya
My favorite player Rose, aye, money on him let's go
We be on that bullshit, we from Chicago
My favorite player Kobe, you be holy moly
When it's cold outside I got on no tee
I remember buying quarters, now I'm at a P
Come out the cut like Snell, I gotta add a three
