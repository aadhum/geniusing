She top me off it feel like o-o-okay, it's okay
Show no love, love'll get you killed, yeah I said that
Up this choppa like aloha, hit your skin Olay, compre-ende?
I was taught to shoot you, can't be avoiding it
She top me off it feel like o-o-okay, it's okay
Aye Big Glo, it's gon' be okay
Shoot a nigga ten times in his face
My choppa look like Big Glo face
His times up, God is it okay
And is it okay if I blow these lil trees anyways
And is it okay if I tell the public anything
She top me off it feel like o-o-okay, it's okay
