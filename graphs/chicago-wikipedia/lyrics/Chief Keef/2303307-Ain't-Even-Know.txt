Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know
Pull them blue hundreds out my pocket
I pulled them up out the blue
bills
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know
Pull up skrt-skrt-skrt, hop out duh-duh-duh
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know
