Ballin' like I'm Michael,
Sosa from Chiraq
I got plenty Louis and Fendi, yo bitch she love it
Indicted for sellin' out my house and doin' drop-offs
you a real nigga, knock-off
I make it rain 100's and 50's, on all these stripper hoes
No feelings but I'm addicted, to all these stripper hoes
This 40 I keep it on me, like it's hoey
I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin' but I ain't hoopin'
Strip club I threw 'bout ten up
I had it pourin'
