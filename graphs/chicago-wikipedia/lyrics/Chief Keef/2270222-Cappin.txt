But these motherfuckin Margiela shoes I bought Is for me cappin you know what I'm saying?
Bitches say they bad bitches, weak bitches average
This for Blood and Cap, Blood and Cap, this for Blood and Cap
This for Cap this for Blood, ridin round with my thud
G-L-O G-A-N-G we not with that giving up
Bullets coming fill you up
Oreo Double Stuffed, Nigga get yo feelings hurt
Aye Tadoe grab my K doe
Aye Justo make sure Benji straight, folks think he in Barbados
