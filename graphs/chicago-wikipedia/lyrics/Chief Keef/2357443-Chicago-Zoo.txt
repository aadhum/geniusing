Say hello to my little friend
I got lions, tigers, bears, jaguars, panthers, sheeps, and goose
Hyenas and monkeys, monkey nuts up on my tool
I got giraffes and elephants, you know what's in my room
Got my chopper in the jungle, they be rumblin' a lot
Spendin' money like a Saudi
Call me Weezy baby, car ain't got no ceilings
Police can't come through the door, cause I'm lockin' it
Unless they got a warrant, they just talkin' shit
Fed house still doors why ya'll talk this shit?
You'se a Ratatouille, you'se a rat nigga
When I say okay Kool-Aid it really mean okay cool
