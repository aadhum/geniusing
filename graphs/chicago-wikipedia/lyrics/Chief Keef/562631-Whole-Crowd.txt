Remember letting tools pop in O-block
Smoking on this green dope is so loud
I got enough Tooka for the whole crowd
Referee whistle I am so foul
If you ain't know nigga now you know now
I'm in my BD stance, ten toes down
Life a roller coaster bitch it Glo round
You smoke dirty weed that ain't no loud
I push it to the limit I'm Rick Ross now
I got a lotta pack, lotta thrax
Lotta X, lotta flats bitch, lotta narcotics bitch
Get up off the porch no lacking
