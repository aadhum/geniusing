My gun is so dirty, yours Hi-Point, I bet he jam
Take a whiff of this here, my gun fun and shit, pardon it
Jumped out the porch when I was 9 and shit
On the block totin' a 9 and shit
Runnin' up, committin' crimes and shit
Them bein' on that grimy shit
You got a Hi-Point, aye, nigga what?
You think with that Hi-Point, aye, you finna bust?
your cars
