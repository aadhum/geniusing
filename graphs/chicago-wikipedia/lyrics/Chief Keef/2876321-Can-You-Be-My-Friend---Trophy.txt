wine
Baby will you take me for who I am
I know you don't want no scrub
Baby Ima boss you should love that in me
She's like "But my bestfriend was like 'Baby he's a dog he was trynna holla at me'"
Get so much of you I OD
Squeeze on you like my toolie
Clean you up like my jewelry
She take it slow then she wine it up
I'm showing love but it's not enough
Girl you look fine like wine
Baby I'm a young Randy Moss
I can catch it long as you throw it
Just picked up a new scent from Barney's, baby
You that I smell like I'm ballin' (Bang, bang)
You know that I ain't used to one night
I can have you here in one flight, baby
It's just me and you in one boat
They see us on this yacht, they gon' go crazy
