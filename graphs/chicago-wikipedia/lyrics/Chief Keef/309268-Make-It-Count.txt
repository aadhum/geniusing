I just bought a 40 cause there ain't no kick
Got a 30 in it I'ma make it spit
I'm gon' make it count, bitch I'm spraying shit
I'ma count this money while I take a shit
I'ma spray that dummy if he try to take my shit
I got old guns on that cranky shit
I got new guns can't wait to spray that shit
I swear my Mac be on some player shit
Smoking Tooka like a hookah
No Versace Medusa
1400 for this belt like booyah
Hurting my damn neck like ooh ah
Ben Franklin in my pocket
Try to take it put your ass on the front of New York Times
Can't see me boy cause you are, blind
You say you getting money
You are, lying
Got a car 'round my neck now who wanna, drive
