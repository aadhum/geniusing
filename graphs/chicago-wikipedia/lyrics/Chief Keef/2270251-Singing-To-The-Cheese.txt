Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese
My palm itching plenty guap get plenty o's
You think it's sweet them weapons I get plenty those
I want some head this nigga bitch she 1-10
I want some grands, want some millions
Want some billions, don't want no friends
Want some weed, want some killers
I want some streets, want some houses, want some buildings
Bitch I'm rich but I still got that savage in me
I'm high as fuck bitch I got two 7s in me
Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese
Like Sosa Wonder I be with the keys
Me Sosa Ray Charles or Sosa r&B
Call me Sosa Liu Kang I'm the man with the kicks on
Call me Sosa Yu Gi Oh I'm the nigga with the dragon card
Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smoking on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how you allergic to money?
You can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reeking of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reeking them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singing them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singing to the cheese
