[Intro: Chief Keef]
Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang
Gang gang
Bang bang
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I was like, "He couldn't have had his head on"
I be suited, I be booted, ready for anything
I done partied, I done sipped Bacardi
Rollin' with Blood, we done crashed all the parties
We done rode Ferraris, rode Lamborghinis
Now only thing that I care about is breathing
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I bet you remember posted on the block
All we knew was shots
We ain't really know about the guap
All we knew was Glocks
I remember when you called my phone tweakin'
You got your first deal, you was geekin'
Like for now I am Chief Sosa Yeezus
You was like, "Nah you're Almighty"
Almighty don't like nobody
Shootin' .40 cals, now we gettin' 40
Bands for a show and we stay 'til the morning
I'ma pass the pall to you and you can hang it up
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
No matter what I might say
No matter what you might say
No matter what I say
No matter what your friends say
No matter what our friends say
No matter what, what I say
No matter what, what I say
Just know this, I miss you Big Glo
