Aye, Chief Sosa man, Almighty Sosa nigga, Big Gucci Sosa man
Aye, rest in peace Big Glo
Rest in peace real Lil Steve nigga
Free Rose nigga
Grip up on my hip, Imma let it rip
Blood gang, I fuck with crips
If you gon bring a knife nigga don't bring not a weapon
Chief Sosa Buddha cuz I got a big old belly
Swear these niggas always jokin'
Fuckin Mike Eppin'
Hot as ice, swear that I'm so cicle
