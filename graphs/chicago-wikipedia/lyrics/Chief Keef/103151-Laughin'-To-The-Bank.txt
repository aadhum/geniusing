Haw haw haw x4
I'm laughin' to the bank like 'Haw haw haw'
I'm laughin' at these lames like 'Haw haw haw'
HAW HAW HAW x4
I'm flexin' on these lames like 'HAW HAW HAW'
I'm walkin' in the bank like 'HAW HAW HAW'
Ha, ha, ha
I'm from O'Block, bitch, that's my block
I be wack? Haw haw haw
I smoke loud
loud, loud love gettin' high high high
She gone suck my cock like a ba-ba-ba
Cause I got lots of guap
Rap album like "haw, haw, haw",
they smoking mild, mild, mild
I walked through the bank, to get some guap, guap, guap
Back to bag rocks
Speed with a hundred miles, laugh at cops like "haw, haw, haw"
Ya'll can't catch me now, watch me get by, by, by
My bitches bi, bi, bi, I hit then "Bye, bye, bye."
I'm laughin' to the bank like "haw, haw, haw"
