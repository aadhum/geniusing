Bitch my name is Sosa
You can call me Sammy
Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash
Spend them stacks, spend them stacks and get it back
OTF my niggas they invented that (OTF)
Smoking on this loud, call it the stinky pack (dope)
Count so much money that my fingers cramp ('sgetit)
All my niggas Wildin’ we don’t give a damn
(Looney)
Ask your main bitch she know who I am
(Sosa Baby)
Rob him for his taxes if he’s a son of Sam
Who gives a fuck, we don’t care bout nothin’ Fam!
Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom
And if his mouth moving, my gun dance some
All these bitches on me, I won’t wife none
I have them bitches runnin’, when the pipe come
Fake ass niggas that’s a shit I don’t like
Kilogram flow, that’s the shit I dont write
All these fucking games, that’s the shit I don’t play
2 door Murcielago and its smoke grey
Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy
It will open up a nigga like some candy (BOOM)
In the barrel, look like a Cambell’s soup can
Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand
(HAHA)
Talkin 36 O’s and im the OG
One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key
Muzzle on the rock, while it flash it go bang
Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain
Got em pitchin wild 100‘s
keep it 300
Man that head so good bought her a 300
Understand me
Nigga
Understand me
Understand me
If thuggin was a catgory
I'd win a Grammy
