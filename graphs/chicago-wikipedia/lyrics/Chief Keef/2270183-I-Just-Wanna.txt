These bitches want my money, I won't give it
These bitches fronting, they just want your money
Yeah, I see you bitches on the come up (I see ya)
I see these bitches on the come up (I see ya)
See these bitches on the come up
Always into something crazy
Uh uh, don't care who you fucking lately
Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it
Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it
Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana
All I wanna, smoke some weed and get some commas
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna
Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys
I'm on a green diet, I don't want no french fries
I just wanna get by, I just wanna get high
I just wanna get a cake, I just wanna get pie
I just wanna live my life, I just wanna rock my ice
I just wanna fucking shine, I be glowing all the time
Smoking ganja, counting commas
Fucking thotties, I probably fucked yo momma
Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya
If your dumbass try running, then them bullets run for ya
Cause I be minding my business, I love money and THC
Who the fuck just hopped out with that rock on, that's Keef Jay-Z
All I know is top baby, all I know is freak baby
Now what you wanna? What you tryna do baby?
Say you coming through, who with you?
Okay cool baby, it's cool baby
It's me and my jewels and the crew baby, and the goo baby
You was talking nonsense I was through baby
I hop in, in my car, vroom, vroom baby
You crazy
Damn baby, when I walked in the room I know you noticed it
Damn baby, I know you smell this loud when I start rolling it
Blowing it, all I wanna get money and smoke marijuana
All I want to, smoke some weed and get some commas
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna
I just wanna
Baby, I just wanna get cheese and smoke green with my guys
I'm on a green diet, I don't want no french fries
It's just me, myself and money (all this money)
Don't need nothing else
Don't even trust myself
Swear I need some fucking help
I'm nodding off, unconscious
Wake up nauseous, god damn alcoholic
Pulling ten grand out my wallet
Know they 'bout to judge me
I been sitting at the crib, I'm sick of counting money
Bored of being rich as fuck, tried every single drug
It's not exciting anymore once that first million come
I got my business up, now I just don't give a fuck
(I just wanna get faded, with some of the greatest
Every single motherfucking homie I been down with
They keep me grounded
Fucking thotties, I probably fucked your momma
Rolling with my gunners, my gunners, they'll gun ya
If your dumbass try running, then them bullets run for ya
