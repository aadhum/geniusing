I was ridin' with my beam
Going fast, I done spilled the lean
Knock you out, sting like a bumble bee
Mike Tyson (Bang! Bang!)
Countin' on this white man
His bitch gave me head and I liked it, Katy Perry
You be telling tales, you's a fairy
All I talk is money, ughhhh I'm Master P
Dope got me coughin', ughhhh it's nasty
Yeah you damn right, I don't care if they pull me over
I hit the club fuck the line, bitch I'm Chief Diddy
Blackhawks pride, got the Chiefs with me
Boy you you know these hoes ain't loyal, think I got CB with me
