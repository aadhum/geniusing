Bitch I'm cooler than a cooler
Big shouts out to my jeweler
Hit a lick been rich ever since
These broke ass niggas need tune ups
I say if you need a feature, homeboy hit﻿ up my line
Tadoe off the molly he retarded and shit
And MJ bring the same shoes out, I'm still copping them shits
Bentley coupes and Hummer trucks and 'Raris and shit
I do this so Lolo won't have to worry again
And KayKay can be like pops and ride raris and shit
There go Chief Sosa, girl he ducking paparazzi again
You looking for me I’m in the woods with Holly in shit
