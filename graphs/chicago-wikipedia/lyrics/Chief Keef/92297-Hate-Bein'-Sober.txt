Ballout roll up, when we roll up bitches be on us
Cause we can’t spell sober
Cause I can’t spell sober
Fredo got a hangover he toting a Cobra
Last night he was shooting shit up like O-Dog
Let my alcoholic bitch hit the dutch, she start choking
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
We got 100 pounds of this shit, my stash house with them bricks
My pockets filled with them stacks, my bitch be gone off a flat
She a hot tamale when she pop a molly,
Drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, we high for sure
I came in back of that Rolls, nigga I ain’t stuntin' them hoes
Trick, what you spend on her, we spend on clothes
Too young for me she want Sosa,
shooters in the Range Rover
That's GBE, when them two-two-threes get to flyin' bitch its over
Bitch I got to get mine, nigga get outta line, I check 'em
Talking pounds cause I smoke it
Talking game cause I played it
I’m wasted, Rose thats my favorite
OG kush, you can taste it
Dont smell no one smoking
Me and my niggas gon' roll up
Believe they gon' fire on you
You think you could roll up
You smoke by the ounce
Well bitch, I smoke by the pound ‘cause
