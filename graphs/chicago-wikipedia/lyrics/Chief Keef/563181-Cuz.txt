Car color soo woo
Seats same color crip
Baby I'm a fuckin' loose screw
Cuz I used to hang on the deck
All these fuckin' niggas fufu
I'm smokin' on that fuckin' TuTu
With a fuckin' bang on my hip
Walk up on me, I do you
All the rims on the truck or my coupe
Hop up in that fuckin' Blue's Clues
All I do is blang, look at my wrist Big Tymer's bling bling
I done named my son your highness, bitch that's a young king name
Chopper bullets make 'em rain, rain
