Your Bentley ain't shit and your 'Rari ain't sick
I'm above money cause money don't exist
Now you see my dark side, I am Lord Sith
I got cake in my pocket, cake up on my shoe
I come through chopper G-Un
Cause we heard you got that yayo, the bank, and you got 50 piece
You better hire fucking Young Buck
