Aye, aye, aye, aye
(DP on the beat)
Hundred for the one's and two hundred for my...
I paid hundred for the ones
And two hundred for my gun
Paid a hundred for the drum
Paid fifty for some bullets
That's a box of bullets
And shoot at your medulla
With my ruger
Smoking Tooka
Pull up on ya
Pull up to ya
Pull up in that 'Rari, hallelujah
Then I hop up in my Beemer just to fool ya
Fool your bitch, I pull up in that fucking Hummer
Hummer H2 bitch
It go faster than a Harley
Someone please pass me the damn Marley
Even though I don't smoke with nobody
Got my Tommy
Shoot this shit right up at your tummy
Now you're looking like a zombie
Trying to get help but you couldn't find it
My Beemer colored soo woo ravioli
'Member when I used to eat ravioli?
I paid hundred for the ones
And two hundred for my gun
Paid a hundred for the drum
Paid fifty for some bullets
That's a box of bullets
And shoot at your medulla
With my ruger
Smoking Tooka
Pull up on ya
Pull up to ya
So we're coolin' in my mansion
How much you got to get her back fam
Boy I heard your belt Versace
I got 50 times Versace in my pocket
