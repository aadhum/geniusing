I'm a warrior with a thirty, nigga I ain't Curry
Wokcano's
But wanting to hit thirty-four bitch that's Eddy Curry
I'm still smoking loud even though you hear me
Bitch I'm in the field White Sox Paul Konerko
Ronald Belasario
And I swear my watch a thot, it is a lil flirty ho
Bitch I'm trapping in my trap dancing like Lil TerRio
White 'vette, pull up red interior
All this jewelry on got me blinging up
Nigga want war, tell him
