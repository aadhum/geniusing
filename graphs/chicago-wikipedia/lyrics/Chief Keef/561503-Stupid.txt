Since I've been eating now I like a bunch of food
Who the fuck is you I don't run with you
I run with the Glo, I run with the crew
I run with the gang, I run with some shooters
don't believe in cupid that shit stupid
Racks up in my ugly trus I've been doing this shit since
Buddha
I don't even know the name of them but I just do it Nike
Merge the other way to the left like Beyonce
Doing one eighty up on the fucking freeway
