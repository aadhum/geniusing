When it's ugly, I bring that gat wit'
I up this motherfucker ain't with that shit
You be smokin' dirty,
I smoke that cat piss
I walk up in the mall straight cashin'
She said she love me, whatever that is
I walk up in the bank straight laughin'
Life's a box of chocolate, not Nesquik
I don't need no security, I got it
