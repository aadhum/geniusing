Bang, Bang, Bang, Bang Bang
That smoke got me gone you can hear in the air
We on top like some stairs
I don't give no fuck, I be going to hell
But I'm a let this hammer blow like...
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Bang Bang
But I'm a let this hammer blow like...
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang
Bang Bang
But I'm a let this hammer blow like...
Choppers get let off (let off)
Now they don't want no war (they don't)
30 clips and them .45s gotta go back to that store
And that kush getting smoked gotta go back to the store
Cock back cause there's trouble a man's gone blow
So they ass better get low
Or get hit
Oh shit
That bulldog made his ass split
Only thing she for is to get head
I'm talking this dick
If she snitch, she can get the 30 clip
All we know is bang and then dip
And those bangers hollow tips
We got big hawks and eagles
That's gone knock you off your shoes
Tech9,
30 clip,
.45
Smoking loud this buddy loud, so I ain't coming back
Off of pill I feel like E.T bitch
Can't get caught by CPD bitch
My nigga Dooski he got my back
You better listen we got the mack
And on ya back we make nolia clap
We gone make some bullets rain on your block
O'Block we the choppa shop
Big propane like novocaine
Chief Keef bitch I'm so insane
And there's dope boys, Lamron
Young money and 4'6
Flip a nigga like Patti cake
