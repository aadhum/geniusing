Moment of silence for Griselda Blanco
Now let's bring the drugs in for Griselda Blanco
And I got my dogs with me like Griselda Blanco
And we got some drugs with we like Griselda Blanco
Griselda Blanco, brick up on my wrist, nigga
Bling, bling go boil the pot, tick tick nigga
Moment of silence for Griselda Blanco
Now let's bring the drugs in for Griselda Blanco
And I got my dogs with me like Griselda Blanco
And we got some drugs with we like Grisgelda Blanco
Griselda Blanco no one doubt, drugs and car, I'm rollin' round
Moment of silence for Griselda Blanco
Now let's bring the drugs in for Griselda Blanco
And I got my dogs with me like Griselda Blanco
And we got some drugs with we like Grisgelda Blanco
