Uh. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need y'all to bounce for me. Uh. I need y'all to bounce for me. What? I need y'all, I need y'all
[Hook: Usher]
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part 2 of my confessions
If I'm gonna tell it then I gotta tell it all
Damn near cried when I got that phone call
I'm so throwed and I don't know what to do
But to give you part 2 of my confessions
I got a mess that can't be mopped up
Chilling with my girl and guess who popped up
A chick from the road that says she's knocked up
Roc
You don't realize, you just made a ghetto girl's dreams
She don't need a ring cause she got you till he 18
But these girls is genius's, we thinking with our penis's
In my opinion, that's when they take us to the cleaners
[Verse Three: Usher]
Sittin here stuck on stupid, tryna figure out
When, what, and how I'mma let this come out of my mouth
Said it ain't gon' be easy
But I need to stop thinkin', contemplatin'
Be a man and get it over with (over with)
I'm ridin' in my whip
Racin' to her place
Talkin' to myself
Preparin' to tell her to her face
She open up the door and didn't want to come near me
I said "one second baby please hear me"
