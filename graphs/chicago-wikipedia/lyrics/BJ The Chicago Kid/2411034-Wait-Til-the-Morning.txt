Sitting on the front porch thinking about what happened
And how it all went down that shit was crazy
But you know I can’t afford to lose my lady
But you know lately we been going crazy
But you know we’re bigger than any of this
And you know that we ain’t ready to split
Am I wrong for thinking it’ll all go away or you could just carry on like you didn’t see my face
I’m tryna fix it all
You tryna tell it all
Could we just hold this off and wait till the morning
I know I did her wrong
But you tryna cut us off
Can we just hold this off
And wait till the morning
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
(I know you gone tell her)
Wait till the morning
I just need another night to make love to her like my wife
I know you loyal
To your girl though
But I love her
No more undercover
She my baby
And you her best friend
I know my name ain’t worth more than dirt right now but please listen
