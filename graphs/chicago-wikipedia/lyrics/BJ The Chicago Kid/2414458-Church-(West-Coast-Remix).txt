She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
Flippin' through the pages of the Old Testament
Like baby, don't test me
I grew up in the pulpits
But I was on the drum stool, riffin' and groovin
And every Sunday you the best dressin'
But I don't know who you foolin
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
win like the boys in '97
Do it again, Lord forgive us for our sins
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
Hopefully we can go to heaven
(I pray) Hopefully we go to heaven
(We can go to hell) Hopefully we can go to heaven
(I Pray) Hopefully we can go to heaven
Hopefully we can go to heaven
