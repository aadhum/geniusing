Girl let me lay you down baby and give you what you need (in my bedroom)
I'm rough when necessary but I'm guaranteed to please
You took your panties off in the car
So baby girl scratch that we ain't gotta do that
And when we start to kissing we'll both be listening to the sounds of our hearts
Girl we can do it all night
And when we start to touching we'll both be loving every moment of tonight
All this can happen babe if you just say aiight
Baby just say aiight
Girl now that I'm inside baby I just can't keep my cool, no (in my bedroom)
Now tell me ain't that some shit now
I'm loving what I'm feeling but it's so much we can do, baby
You took your panties off in the car (Baby-ay-ay-ay-ay)
And when we start to kissing we'll both be listening to the sounds of our hearts
Cause we can do it all night
All this is happening babe cause you said aiight
Lil mama you said aiight
