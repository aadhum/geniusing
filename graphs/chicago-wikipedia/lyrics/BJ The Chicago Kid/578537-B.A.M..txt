You fine as hell, you know you are
You shine just like a shining star
On a nighttime, on a daytime
In the city you go to, they say you fine
I only fuck with centerfolds nigga
When you see me pull up in a rover
Then you know it's time for you to bend over
got you on
Girl I ain't tripping if you give it on the first night
Cause really I was down to fucking you at first sight
I was leaving other bitches like a throw-away
My homie told me that I shouldn't let it go too far
The last nigga that you was with, you probably broke his heart, cause you
