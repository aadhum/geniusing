I know it's been a while since we've been together
I heard that you got a new friend
But I never seen y'all together
Till I seen it for my self this weekend
I ain't hating but homie cool
But we both know homeboy ain't me
And seeing that smile on your face
Made me sick that a sucker replaced me
And what's so bad I know you felt
That same shit that made my heart melt
That night that we fell in love so fast
I want you back, I want you back, I want you back
