You can talk all your shit while you’re with him
But girl I know that you ain’t happy with him
Cause baby, real love never dies
You can act all you want, you deserve an award
But soon you gon’ learn now that love ain’t no toy
Cause baby that real love never dies
Girl I remember the day that I saw you I knew I
(I knew I wanted to have you)
And I had this feeling that this thing was gonna be
More than just one night (more like forever)
give me rehab
still…
