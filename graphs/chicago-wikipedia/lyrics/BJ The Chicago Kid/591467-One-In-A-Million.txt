[Intro]
Love it babe. Love it babe. Love it babe
I know you love it babe. Love it babe. Love it babe (x3)

[Verse 1]
Baby you don't know, what you do to me
Between me and you, I feel a chemistry
Won't let no one come and take your place
Cause the love you give can't be replaced
Cause no one else love me like you do
That's why I don't mind to spend my life with you
Wanna please you in anyway I can
Wanna share my world, don't you understand

[Hook]
Your love is a one in a million it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long
Your love is a one in a million it goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin' all day long

[Verse 2]
Turn me inside out, make my heart speak
Don't want no one else, you're all I need
Personality(ty) in everything you do (do)
Makes me love, everything about you
Cause your smile, your style is so fly I can't deny
I got a crush on you, and that's true indeed
I'm digging you, you make me believe

[Hook]

[Bridge: Aaliyah]
I'll give you anything you want from me anything you want anything you need
Anything your soul desires
I'll give you anything you want from me anything you want anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything cause

[Hook]
[Verse 3]
In the players club checking out your body babe
Steadily tossing that cash flow babe
Betcha I can make your body talk to me
And when you leave up out my room, you'll be walking bow-legged
Come and get some of this R&B thug babe
[Bridge 2]
[Verse 4]
Take my money, my house and my car
For one hit of you baby, you can have it all
Cause makin' love every time you do
Girl it's worse than drugs
Cause I'm an addict of you
And you know that I

[Bridge 3]
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
I can't leave you alone
You got me feenin'
Girl I'm feenin' for you

[Verse 5]
Lady I'm hooked on you
There's nothin' else I'd rather do
Spend my last dime, for a drop of your time
Cause you're the girl without a doubt, you know you got me strung down
I need you more than more
Cause you are my joy
You got my feenin'
Girl I'm feenin' for you
Now she was raised in Illinois
Right outside of Chicago
Some of the best cooking you've ever had
And I miss her
Hey woman if you're listening
Said I miss you baby
