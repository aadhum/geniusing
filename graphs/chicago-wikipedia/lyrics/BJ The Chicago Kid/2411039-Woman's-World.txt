This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world
Money just don’t compare
Far more valuable than a house made of gold
This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world
Let’s talk about the power
The power of a woman
Tell me who can give life to a baby boy and turn him in to a man
This is a woman’s world
This is a woman’s world
I know you heard that this is a man’s world
But this is a woman’s world
Show me a man
A powerful man
I will show you a strong woman behind him
