but I don't got a strap
So I hope nobody try to run up on me with the mac
Like "blat!"
Lay a nigga flat
But let me fall back cause I ain't into all that
Tryin' not to get caught up where I'm at
In the 'jects where the mice gettin' cheese with the rats
we all know who's Geppetto
Angel on your shoulder, in your ear you got the devil
Cause these streets still cold like metal
When it's heat, it ain't sweet
And them shots ain't Jell-O
So, props to them niggas takin' shots like Melo
From the block, just tryna meet the top like "hello!"
