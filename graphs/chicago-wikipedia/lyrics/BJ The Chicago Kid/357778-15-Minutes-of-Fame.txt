[Verse 1: BJ The Chicago Kid]
[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Heard the guy you left me for wasn’t even faithful
But you went to him anyway
Heard every time you left from seeing him yea
But he had another one on the way
Girl just to think I still love you
Yea, a nigga have to be crazy
And girl I never thought you’d be the one
To leave me
I fell for someone who couldn’t stop trippin'
You never gon' get it like En Vogue in the friend zone
Seen it comin' quicker like a psychic who a nympho
But I’m cool on my bullshit
Like a matador with new shoes avoid the bullshit
Said I was the one like Neo and I’m guessin' you was right
When you left felt I dodged a bullet
15 minutes, 15 minutes
15 minutes, baby girl you’re gone
Know I used to love 'er, word to Common, I ain't never hatin'
