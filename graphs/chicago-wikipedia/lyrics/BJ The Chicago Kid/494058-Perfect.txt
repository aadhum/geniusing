That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known
She say her ass ain't big enough
She feel her breasts ain't big enough
She think her abs ain't flat enough
Now when you add it all up
I love it
That body perfect in my eyes
No matter what they say, everything looking just right
You get that blessing in disguise
Wouldn't known it, girl you got me
(Thim slick girls get me every time
Thim slick girls could get every dime)
''Dida dida, dida dida dida, damn''
