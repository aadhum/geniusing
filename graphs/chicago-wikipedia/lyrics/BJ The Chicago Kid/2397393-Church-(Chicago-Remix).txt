She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
She say she wanna drink, do drugs and have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
Hopefully we can go to heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to heaven, cause I'm staying
Hopefully we can go to heaven, I pray
Hopefully we can go to heaven, cause I'm staying, I'm staying

Say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the morning, service in the morning
She say she wanna drink, do drugs, have sex tonight
But I got church in the mornin', church in the mornin'
