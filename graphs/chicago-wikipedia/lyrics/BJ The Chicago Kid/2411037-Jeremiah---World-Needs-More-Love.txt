And it burns real deep (eeh)
Said it burns real deep
Jeremiah said it’s just like fire, yea
Said it burns real deep
The stars still shine at night
Reminds of the look in your beautiful eyes
Sometimes I stare up to the sky yea (yes I do)
Knowing somewhere you seeing the same sky
But you ain’t with me
Since God is love
The whole world needs more love
