Hey Girl
Just the smallest thought of you
Makes me wanna go all night long
When you need my lovin' girl
You know imma' give it to you
Just the way you like it girl
Cause I can do your body so right
And I'm never too far away
Never far away from you
Cause girl ill even take a flight
But now that your here no more hoping and wishin' (wishin)
I got what I've been missin'
I can tell your body's been yearning
But my body's been calling for you baby, baby
I want you to spend the night with me
I wanna lick my lips and still taste you babe (taste you babe)
