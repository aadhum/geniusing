So sick of trying
So tired of lying
Past the point of dying
No compromising
And that fire we had girl just couldn’t survive the rain
Every time I hear a love song on the radio
I think of what we used to have but ain’t got no more
I swear it feel like pain got a thing for me
It’s like love want me to be in pain and want me to leave
