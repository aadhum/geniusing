It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true
When I know when the death of a mother matured him very quickly
So we go fast forward school graduated

He died from a seizure at her daughter's birthday party

Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true
[Verse 3: ScHoolboy Q]
Blue chucks, swing Glocks, they're both in my pants

Pistol grip up on my lap all times
I used to drive a Honda with the dimes inside

Yeah nigga, It's true, cool niggas die too
It could happen to me, it could happen to you
But yeah It's true

And you feel like you really got a guardian angel right now
