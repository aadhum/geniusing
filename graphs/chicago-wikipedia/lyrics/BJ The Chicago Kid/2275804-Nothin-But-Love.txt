I got, the perfect kinda love, brother and sisterly bond
Let you rock your mic if ya' know what you're telling me
I'm even thinkin' wedding rings, movin' onto better things
It's crazy, cos I ain't never feel this way before
And if I did, baby I can't recall
And that just how I feel right now
Let a nigga disrespect, I swear I kill right now
My ride or die forever, she down to roll whenever
Rain, sleet, snow, whatever
It don't matter the weather
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
Because of where we were as friends, I was tryna' say "oh no"
But ever since that day, you're my homie lover baby and I got
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
Because of where we were as friends, I was tryna' say "oh no"
But ever since that day, you're my homie lover baby and I got
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
You know I love you
Because you were there whenever I needed you
Whenever I was down and out, you were there
No matter what time I would call
It would be five in the morning, and you'd show up
I could be drunk, high, my place would be messy as fuck
I be all fucked up at my worst
And you would come around
You would show me love
And that's why I love you
That's why I got nothin' but love for you
Ayo H, what's her name man?
I'm talking bout' the 24 hour delivery spot by my place
Man I'm out, I ain't fuckin' with you
Wait
Ay BJ what's this song about again?
I think I messed up, alright
