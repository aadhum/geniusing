[Chorus:]
When I shine you shine with me baby
Our love, it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Shine bright for the whole world to see
When I shine you shine with me baby
My love, it burns that deep
When I shine, you shine
Baby we shine
When I think about the two of us
It’s not perfect but it’s just for me
I see you smiling now
It’s like a dream but far from make believe
We argue and fight, but girl you stay by my side
For me you put up a fight
And baby I don’t know how we do it but we always stand the rain
When I shine you shine with me baby
Our love, it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Shine bright for the whole world to see
When I shine you shine with me baby
My love, it burns that deep
When I shine, you shine
Baby we shine
Baby they don’t nothing about our love, no
No they don’t know nothing about us
They don’t know nothing about love, no
And girl I know that you go through so much hell for me when you ain’t around me
They call you crazy say you less than a lady but you still my baby
They don’t know the feeling we feel when we’re alone and the world stands still
Cuz when I look in your eyes girl I see the truth and the truth is I’m nothing without you
When I shine you shine with me baby
My love it burns that deep
When I shine you shine with me baby
Baby we shine
