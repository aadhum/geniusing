[Intro: Big K.R.I.T.]
I get up early just to go to work
To stay focused, yeah, I even go to church
Put in overtime, even when it hurts
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
Can you hire me?
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
I need a job, baby can you hire me?
Can you hire me?
[Vamp: B.J. The Chicago Kid]
Here's my resume, wanna work for you so bad
And you hiring me will make all them others mad
One touch, and it's going down
So hire me, for a little while
Here's my resume, wanna work for you so bad
And you hiring me will make all them others mad
One touch, it's going down
So hire me, for a little while

Here's my resume, wanna work for you so bad
I wanna work that body like it's a 9 to 5
One touch, and it's going down
I wanna work that body like it's a 9 to 5
"Turn down for what"
