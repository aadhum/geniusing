Ever been coming home after a long day at work and you see that gas station or that corner store
And you stop there and get your last few things before you go in for the night
And you feel safe before you actually reach your home
So now imagine coming home and that store is burned down
And that gas station is boarded up
It removes that feeling of safe, that feeling of comfort
That feeling of home before you actually reach your home
Jungle taught me how to rumble round the world
That’s why I’ll always love Chicago
It made me humble taught me how to pick myself up when I stumble
Back here in LA, so many days the same, so many things to take you away from what you came here for
You gotta know just who you are and what you came to do
Jungle taught me how to rumble
