Does it feel like an eternity since Acid Rap?
Every day is a workday.
When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later
There's no reason to.
I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands.
But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice.
If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape?
What's an album these days, anyways?
Cause I didn't sell it,
does that mean it's not an official release?
So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring.
