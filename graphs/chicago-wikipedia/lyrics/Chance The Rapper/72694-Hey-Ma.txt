Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma
Hey Ma, hey Ma, hey Ma
I said 'Hey Ma', don't go stretching your wallet
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on get ya nails polished, stylist for your eyelids
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island
Ms. Brown and Ms. Pollock
little boy done grown up
Little voice done blown up
middle-class that bonus
Hey Ma, Hey Mama Jan; God just gave me another chance
Rod just gave me another line, probably gave me another fan
7-7-3, Oh, since Kanye was a three-old
Down the street from D. Rose, was practicing his free-throws
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp, shout out to King Gyro
Shout out that Ms. Moody
auntie Toni them my heroes
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
Got my money saved up

You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
Got my money saved up
(Put that on my mama)
And turned your hairs to grays a lot
And go in stores and take a lot
And never shopped but saved a lot
So you ain't gotta shop at Save A Lot
And you ain't gotta worry about Chase a lot
They playing with your checks, your shit
Cause they gonna take your pay or not
Que Sera

Save Money, my patna dem
I'm part of them, It's part of me
Hot boxing no cops around
I had the tux I had the gown
Just had a show, just had to bounce
#10Day
Muy caliente
And haters gonna throw that epsom
Cause family be that blood though
But twin bro be that Victor
And Big Cuz be that Chef Sean
You gon' see us laid up (Put that on my mama)
Monica and Ava, thanks for all the favors
