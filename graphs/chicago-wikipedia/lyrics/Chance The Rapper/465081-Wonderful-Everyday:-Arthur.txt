It could be (It could be, it could be everyday)
Everyday (It could be wonderful)
Everyday, it could be (It could be)
It could be wonderful (It could be wonderful)
Wonderful (It could be)
Hey
Everyday (Everyday)
It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful everyday (Everyday)
Everyday, it could be, everyday (It could be wonderful, wonderful)
Hey, it could be everyday (It could be everyday)
It could be (Everyday it could be wonderful)
(It could be wonderful everyday)
(Everyday could be so wonderful, it could be)
Everyday when you're walking down the street (Wonderful)
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
(Everyday, everyday it could be wonderful)
And I say hey! (Everyday)
It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other
Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together
[Bridge: Chance The Rapper]
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'mma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
