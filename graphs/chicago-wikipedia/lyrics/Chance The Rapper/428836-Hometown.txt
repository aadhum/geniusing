Hook
Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world (x2)
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
She say she want to stay with the Bloods and Crips
Feel the front strips of inner-city cliques
And kids fall through the holes of hollow gun tips
re-l-a-x
'bout as fly as LAX
And I don't want to have to call you my ex
Well babe, I don't want to have to call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How I'ma ever be her man, nigga, she wants to be a model
My sunshine in life got stole away
Once the Golden State took my gold away, Cali
Now you can catch me giving hickeys to beer bottles
Get it, cause I'm kissing the neck
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don't make the cut but that's how your wrist feel
Cause scripts rip slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world, you'll find allies on the axis
trees, please don't leave
But trees will be changed when it rains, will they shout to you
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I'd never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can't de-weed ya
And as bad as I want to see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack, Cali
