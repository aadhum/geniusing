Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Dang, dang, dang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
Young Rascal Flatts
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
He rep the home of Sosas, you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit
you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'mma be that - CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Two-step
white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing?
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too
It go like: count that stack, pop that cap then down that Jack
All my niggas hit that zan, and all my ladies bob that back
