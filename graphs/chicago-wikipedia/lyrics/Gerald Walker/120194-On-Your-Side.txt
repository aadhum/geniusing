They be like wherever you ride you know that I'll go
I'll be right by your side always letting you know
If I ever decide you should get up and go
Look it don't matter I'mma keep flying high I'll be right there by your side
So wherever I ride I know that they'll go
They'll be right by my side always letting me know
If I ever should rise and just get up and go
It still won't matter they'll keep riding high and be right there by my side
Through whatever is going on whether you right or wrong
I aspire to be your home everything in which we have Gerald
Just call it your own because we down
And I swear my love for you is set in stone alright
Yeah they said it I can see it in their eyes
I was quick to trust their ass too and they took me by surprise
The ones who said they love me they were plotting my demise
Couldn't see through their disguises something about me they despise
So they attacked me spreading rumors through the texts on their phone
Saying I won't get on then they disrespect my songs
They try to bring up old shit act like I ain't know shit
Best friends going back and fucking with my old chicks
Its time to get it in its time for my revenge
Been nice for way too long and yeah its time for it to end
And suddenly I feel like I was talking to my brain
It was clear but it was strange he said
Wherever I ride I know that he goes
He'll be right by my side always letting me know
If I ever decide I should get up and go
It don't matter he'll keep sitting high and be right there by your side
So wherever I ride I know that he'll go
He'll be right by my side always letting me know
If a part of me dies he'll be right where I go
Look it don't matter he'll keep sitting high and be right there by your side
God told me man just finish what you've begun
Got a long way to go but I love the man that you've become
But revenge is not the way to go its just my rule of thumb
Plus some people lacking faith in me for the stupid things you've done
Remember Pam that girl you said you wanna take by the hand
In marriage but when you hit you left her high and dry and ran
Or that job that you prayed to me about to which you were kneeling
Then I gave it to you and in return they caught your ass stealing
Be honest man you made your mother cry told your family lies
Told me you'd stop smoking but you still be getting high
But each every single day I never cease to fail or try
To help you when you need it in the blinking of an eye
I always aid you yeah people played you
But let me handle that shit look im the one who made you
On top of that I called you by my name and I saved you
And now forgive the ones who did you wrong the way I forgave you
Wherever you ride I'll know where you go
I'll be right by your side always letting you know
That if you ever decide you don't want me no more
It don't matter I'mma keep sitting high and be right there by your side
So wherever you ride you know that I'll go
I'll be right by your side always letting you know
If a part of you dies I have it under control
I'mma keep sitting high and be right there by your side
