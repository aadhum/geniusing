Ayy dog I got an idea
I got this money that was meant for paying bills
But fuck AT&T, I don't even get reception
I ain't 'bout to pay 'em shit, just call my niggas up to chill
I don't smoke, but please grab a couple bottles
Let's call my girl Nina, she an up-and-coming model
Tell her bring all of her friends, where she go I know to follow
Tell Muhammad come and DJ, he a fool on Serato
Live my life to the fullest man, it's always been a motto
Fuck em' man I'm starching up my polo
I be racing on these tracks, nigga RIP to FloJo
Its just me and all my dogs, but you little niggas Totos
With some girls that want that bad boy, man shout out to Total,
And I don't wanna hear 'bout you niggas in the struggle
Or you fake gang banging niggas caught up in the hustle
Man tonight we trying to live it up
Look you could be a lame or even in the in crowd
Just don't be a bitch nigga cause that fuck shit ain't allowed
Cause tonight we trying to live it up
Yo I got an idea
I got this bed that I got from Ikea
Excuse this onomatopoeia
But I just wanna zoom zoom in your boom boom
Just make a little room in your womb boo
It's kind of Oddish how I want your Vileplume
Contact high got a nigga talking Pokemon
And it's never a good look
So then I turn around cause I know a nigga blew it
And then she said, Ayo, I like the way that shit was put
Now you say you got this bed, can a girl come can and see it?
Is it contour or is the shit posturepedic boy I'm kidding
I don't care about that shit please believe it
I just want you to Michael Jackson it, Gerald come and beat it
