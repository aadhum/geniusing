Don't tell me who the hardest, who pockets the largest, who your fucking favorite artist
Who ain't grow up with his father fuck the feelings that you harbor, nigga please don't get me started, cause right about now I'm just doing me
Only get so many seconds in this life, and that's a guessta-ment so I estimate its only right
That I address em with large excessive shit, or I might just simply bless em with this new testament cause when I write
Shit is never random for everything that's on this planet, man plan God laughs few people understand it
Shit'll have you feeling stranded like riders in the wake of the Titanic
watch out for them fake Sychophantics
That's people tryna reach your good side with flattery, I'm dropping jewels I know the devil probably mad at me
And making me a target like fuck Gerald Walker, at a meeting with his demons saying we gotta make him falter
Get his girl to cheat distract him with his father, kill his niece fuck with him attack the health of his mother
If he drop a song recruit every hater around the globe, and I'll appeal to God himself if I can fucking take his soul

I'm saying like a gangster to a cop,
a rebel to the CIA
the biggies and the Pacs
A woman with her shit together simply tryna shop, but got these niggas tryna holler cause they see her body knocks
he know they spitting game and it is what it is, cause whats understood don't really need explaining
From black men in a nice whip riding the burbs
to white chic's like Lena Dunham on Girls
Man we all tryna get it, but get profiled like Pakistan-American's post 9/11
I swear we all connected nigga 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon
no faking no breakin' till we make it

You can be hood or a graduate from Harvard, swear now and days everybody is a
