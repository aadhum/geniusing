My momma told me boy a winner always listen
But lovers never do, they sit and wait 'til it's they time to talk
Love is always given (given), hatred is acquired (acquired)
Hate last for a second (second), but loving never tires
I've learned love will carry on (on), year after year
But are you worth it
You gotta sign my mix because without it my shit is worthless
Everybody claim they real, but only project it on the surface
Keep my niggas tight and close, but always focused on the Judas
