[Hook x8]
Got her toes done up
With her finger nails matchin'
Shake
[?] all in my face
Gotta put these chicken heads in they place
I ain't rockin' no stupid bapes
Ain't trippin', I'll juke all day
Who is that in the Phantom,
They gone have me on Concrete Loop in my pajamas
I would need pants big as Hammers
they be sayin' I'm handsome
I was pretty before the dough
Girls be so thirsty, thirsty
Naw, let the pioneer blast my shit
