What? Somebody told me Whitney Houston died
Can't believe to tell you how quickly tears went through my eyes
She was gettin' better, now it's really just blew aside
I still ain't got over Don Cornelius' suicide
One of Heaven's angels for sure, who was really an artist
Could ever come near it, not here in the flesh but you with us in spirit
So sad to hear it, I'm choking up while I come up with these lyrics
Kevin Costner
Clive Davis,
Bobby Brown
Her mama and her daughter, Whitney is where God be now
Such a short time, don't want it to be this way
"If I should stay, I would only be in your way"
If you wanna say rest in peace to Whitney Houston
I had Traxter leave 16 bars open on this song..
So that you could do so with me
So get your verses ready, hop on this track with me
Pay a tribute to the late Whitney Houston
