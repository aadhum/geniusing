A tornado flew around my room before you came
Sadder than purple rain memory's got me cryin' like a dove
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Got a fighter jet, I don’t get to fly it, though
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won’t ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We’ll go down this road
‘Til it turns from color to black and white
