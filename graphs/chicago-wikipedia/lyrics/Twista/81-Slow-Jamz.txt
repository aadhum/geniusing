[Produced by Kanye West]
Are you going to be, say that you're gonna be
[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
She say she want some Marvin Gaye,
some Luther Vandross
A little Anita, will definitely set this party off right
She say she want some Ready For The World,
some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton, will definitely set this party off right
I told her to "Drive over in your new whip
Bring some friends you cool with
so we get our grind on
She be grabbing, calling me Biggie, like Shyne home
why she always lying though?
Telling me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready for the World,
she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't a freak, so you gotta prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take your pants off
I'mma play this Gladys Knight,
me and you gon' get right
Verse 2: Twista
Got you looking at the gliss' on my hands and wrists
While I'm laying back, smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rocking the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan-man and Twist
From the Chi
and I be sipping Hennessy
Play some R&B
while I smoke a B
Well well well well
sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista can work it like The Whispers
Hit the stop light, get into some Isley's
The rims still moving so I'm bumping a little Spinners
smoking on a B
on them 23's
And I do it (Well well well well)
Put my Earth in the Wind smokin' Fire
get your sheets wet
listening to Keith Sweat
Maze
Fulfilling our every temptation, slow-jamming, having deep sex
Ready for the World
baby don't say no to me
And every moment you controlling me
Jodeci
And when I come over and bend your ass
You be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
I done hit it from the back
the melody of "Roll It Slow"
Now I gotta go up in it fast, but I'mma finish last
No matter how much of a thug, you see
I still spit it like its R&B
And with some Luther come on
I hope you feelin' me
Verse 3: Twista
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man
take it to the dome
Then I got to bone
And if you ain't got no man, hop up in my Brougham
I keep it pimping like an old man
Cause after that then I, take you to my home
We can get it on, disconnect the phone
Trying to get you gone, I'mma make you moan
