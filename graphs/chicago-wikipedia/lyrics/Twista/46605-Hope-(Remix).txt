So that all the soldiers that were sent overseas come home
And then we gotta move straight forward cause we bite so strong
So when right go wrong
Just say a lil' prayer, get your money man, life goes on... (Let's go)
Take this music and use it, let it take you away
And be hopeful, hopeful, and He'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but - that's okay
I wish that you would show some love
Instead of hatin' so much when you see some other people comin' up (I wish)
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Write some music and have them trippin' off the joy I bring
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder (I wish)
You feel me
And I - wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse and Pac and Biggie breathe again
Wish that I could bring back the people that died at E2
Wish the earth wasn't so apocaliptic
And in the famous words of Mister King, 'why can't we all just get along?'
With the faith of a mustard seed, you can move mountains
