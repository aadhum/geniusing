One morning I woke up next to a thick bitch
Took a shower dried off brushed the gold teeth like Slick Rick
Tapped on Obsession colonge like Doug E. Fresh in the flesh
The high discover me,
Two women butterly lovely in front of me got my head gone
I sent the bitch in the bed home
cause one of them
Got chocolate big thighs and the other one was a redbone
Where y'all goin y'all thick as hell
What's your name I wanna get up with y'all tonight shit
I got some homies that lonely never phony we on some hype shit
Call up the buddies you be tight with
We ain't really gon be doin too much though
We just ridin around bumpin sounds trippin out while we flame janes
Tappin the horn at the homies that gangbang
And slang 'caine to maintain
Grab the buckle and unfasten it
And we can get into some ol' nasty shit
But hit the weed tip first cause my clique got to be riding high
Cause it feels so good
Phillies
Me and my homies hooked up some cowards took up
When niggas we lust smokin some but the flame tight
Trippin off how we survivin this rugged terrain
strap
Hustlin and chillin's what I'm focusin on
Fiendin through bitch's cribs hopin it's on
If ain't no strokin we strollin along
Glisten from all the sunlight
every night we see at least one fight
Hookin up with my fellow Westside cliques
We gon' to blaze on till my brain's blown
Not matter what block you stay on kick it
Round the world it's the same song
For scratch we was willin' to squirt some blood
Mo'
Bumpin a system costin 4 G's
Split the Phillie with my door keys
Tekken 2
Turn out the lights like the World Class Wreckin' Crew
"O"
Get a "B" and split it
