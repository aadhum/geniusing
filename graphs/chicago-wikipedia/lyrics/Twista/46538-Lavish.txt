Flipping work is just like flipping real estate
Uh, one time for my niggas on the corner
With the burners on and with the fresh yams in they tube socks
The bang is the same even if it's muffled
He's cold in your arms, but you ain't gon' be foldin your arms
You gon' be lowered in your arms
Chains full of ice with S after the V's
My nigga open yo' mind, mind
Aren't you ready to go?
All of my fears inside, side
Let 'em blow like 'dro
Reminiscin as I take a listen to my nigga 'Pac
While I envision my ambitions as a rider
