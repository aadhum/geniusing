Badunkadunk
it's so much fun
Look at the motherfucking fatty
Even though you only walking
It be still looking like you shouldn't do that shit in public
Booty so fat
Gap so nice you can see the ass from the front
I need a hundred ones
Burberry
And when you shake it for the dollar
clap that ass
Now shorty think she fine
Only if she really knew the truth
I ain't gon' lie girl, twerk them thighs
I'm in love with your big badunkadunk
Can you make it go wobbly wobbly?
