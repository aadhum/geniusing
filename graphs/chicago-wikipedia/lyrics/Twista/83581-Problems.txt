When I'm on the track you will see accuracy
Actually I know that you will see I come like I got the fully
Automatic for disintegration of the problematic and negativity of whoever caused the static
Get out the matrix and let's get back to the basics
Instead of being individual let's practice a ritual of bein' indivisible when it's critical
So every time that some drama hit yo doorstep
Gotta try to keep your composure and don't let
I'm a problem because I'm different and people don't get it
When I be the clown, knockin' suckas down when I be kickin' my music
If you accustomed to lovey dovey movies
Then you unlucky because they call me Tecca Nina the snuff film
[Verse 3: Twista]
My alien complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
But when it come to dealin with pain and problems and relationships I ain't gonna lie I ain't the bomb yet
Do I need to pay attention to conspiracy theories
Smile, even if the landlord callin
