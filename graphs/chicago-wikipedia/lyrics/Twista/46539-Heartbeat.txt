Oh, Twista told you don't make him mad
You won't like me when I'm mad, I'm a motherfucking beast
Now if you don't wanna die, then I suggest you better try
Breathe hard, hold on to your life, fight nigga
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Don't die nigga, breathe nigga breathe
metamorph into
But if a nigga talk shit, I'll go right for the chrome
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Be strong nigga, breathe nigga breathe
Can you feel your, heartbeat?
You still got a, heartbeat
They can take away your, heartbeat
Don't die nigga, breathe nigga breathe
