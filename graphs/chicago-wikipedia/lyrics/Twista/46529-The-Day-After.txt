The day after... the day after...
"Are we on the air? Yes, we are live at the scene
Of this tragic accident, where a car has ran into a building
The person in the car was positively identified as rap star Twista
Apparently, he went _Kamikaze_. The big question is
Will the rapper survive?"
[Syleena Johnson]
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You got a right to survive, ohhh, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it - you've gotta fiiiight

Vietnam
Got a strap to my back and I ran in if I was a terrorist
Got 'em all scanned at this President's head everybody be calm
Die for my belief, but got out the rubbish because of
This cup of Death that was not yet meant for me to drink from it
Thinkin how could I ever survive, I knew I was ready to ride

(You got a right to survive)
But you gotta have will and always be ready to come off the wall
They gon' be willin to test you and catch you if you talk the talk
But I'mma keep on with the struggle fuck leavin my body in chalk
Look at me now cause I'm standin on top of the globe (say what)
Makin big money for spittin my popular flow (say what)
Now look at the swagger of a platinum veteran servin 'em medicine
Instead of givin en work cause I'm choppin them O's
Can't fuck with the swagger the haters just look at me nigh
I'm stickin them daggers in haters just look at them cry
The shit on the flag is effect us they wanna imagine
I'm makin 'em look at the sky
