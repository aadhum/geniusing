I mean come on homie
You know the rules to the game
Yo bitch chose me
You know it gets suddenless why we got some class
We can get to do some gangsta shit
I got 26s on my new truck, range rover
With this ice, fish gonna bite
So the bitch got in my car
She won't do the smacking, she like giving dough
She the type you don't own
Ass fat, waist slim, Kim Kardashian fashion
I told her to dance, she twerk it to Juicy
