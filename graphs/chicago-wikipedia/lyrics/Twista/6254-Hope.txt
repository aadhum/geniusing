Man, I know we had a lot of tragedies lately
I just wanna say rest in peace to Aaliyah
Rest in peace to Left Eye
Rest in peace to Jam Master Jay
And everybody lost in the Twin Towers
And everybody lost period
All we got is hope
I wish the way I was living could stop, serving rocks
Knowing the cops is hot when I'm on the block
Or that we would just come up on some stacks and hit a lick
[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful
I wish that you could show some love
Instead of hatin so much when you see some other people comin up
I wish I could teach the world to sing
Watch the music and have 'em trippin of the joy I bring
Listen instead of dissin lessons from a grown man
lack that's on dubs
See the vision of the world through the eyes of Stevie Wonder, (you feel me)
And don't nobody in my family see six feet, (ya dig)
Wish I could give every celly some commissary
And the po po bring the heat on them priests like they did R. Kelly
And I wish that D.O.C. could scream again
And bullets could reverse so Pac and Biggie breath again, (shit) (I wish)
Then one day they could speak again
I wish that we only saw good news every time we look at CNN
I wish that enemies could talk
And that super homie Christopher Reeve could still walk
[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful
Wish the earth wasn't so apocalyptic
Wish it was all good so the country wouldn't have to go to war
And in the famous words of Mr. King "Why can't we all just get along"
With the faith of a mustard seed you can move mountains
[Hook: Cee-Lo Green]
Cause I'm hopeful, yes I am, hopeful for today
Take this music and use it
Let it take you away
And be hopeful (hopeful) and he'll make a way
I know it ain't easy but that's okay
Cause we hopeful
