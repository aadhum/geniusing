My mental complex can get as lethal as bomb threats
When I put together patterns and concepts
MC's evacuate when I activate raps of fate
I'm strapped with hate when I'm at the plate
To fly motherfuckers' heads over the gate
Beat MC's at ease in a breeze, freeze 'em at 3 degrees
And verbal dusting, I'm crushing guts and nuts
And leavin niggas disgusting
When I'm thrusting like rockets I pull eyes out sockets
Put a clip to my lip and cock it, for punks without a pocket
Top it, I'm to hyped to stop it, you're too microscopic
I dwell in the chamber like toxic
On point as if a sniper pops it, rhythms get optic
Are you ready for emergency surgery, verbally
For accusing me of flow burglary (third degree)
Hotter than red devil niggas get burnt
Ruin the mothafuckas blessings until a lessons learned
(can it possibly build?)
animosity kills
On stages and on cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
It's your funeral, so order some flowers from the florist
(oris)
On stages and on cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
Dolemite
Testing me is worse than hiding from Norman Bates in the shower
On stages and on cyphers, how many rappers are remaining?
