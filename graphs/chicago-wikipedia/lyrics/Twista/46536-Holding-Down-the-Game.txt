Chi-town balla, K-town nigga
While I'm talkin better never see you laughin
Know I gotta show 'em ain't a damn thing funny
Twista got game
Finna spit it to 'em hard
Get your dame
Put 'em on the boulevard
Now I got her in training with my bottom bitch
And be able to get fetti for her daddy from a lot a tricks
Take a look at my jacob
Now come look at the diamonds up in the ears
Now come take a look at the gators
Alias Aurelius nigga call me gladiator
