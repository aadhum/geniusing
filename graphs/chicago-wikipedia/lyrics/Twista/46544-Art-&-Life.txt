Known to dish the raw, dish the law if they come up
And I used to grind out on my friend's spot
'til he's mom wanted my Tim-bots
I got my mind on my money, money on mind
We blessed wit' the talent, fuck wit this clique, it ain't gon' be easy
Cause you fuckin' wit' Twist if you fuck wit Chris, Bleek and Free-wheezy
