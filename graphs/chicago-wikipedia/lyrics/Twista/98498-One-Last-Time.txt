Princess cuts hurt your eyes
Pull the top back on the prowler
Like the car ain't circumcised
Turn my volume under ten
To keep my speakers from busting
If beef is brewing
I'm a put slugs deep into him
Money they be pursuing
The nerve of these jealous bastards for hatin'
Can't three-eighty us
Cause it only takes a second to pop me a snitch
Call up my connection to cop me a brick
bi-no
I done seen truck loads with more keys than accordions on them
You can see me visit the optometrist
maric√≥n
cabeza
Pinche puto
Had him confess like a catholic
