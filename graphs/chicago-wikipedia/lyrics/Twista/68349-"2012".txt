You know they say (they say) that its all gonna end some day

(Bridge: Tia London)
So, right before it does (right before it does)
Let’s make love (let’s make love)
Now they be telling me that these are the last days
Are we really that close to Armageddon
If living on the planet ’till this point has been hell
I survived ’cause I am legend
What if it’s all about to be over
Then I’m gonna say you need to be my girlfriend
It’s predicted by the ancient Mayan civilization
Making love ’till the terminator come
Comfort each other but we don’t know which way to run
Silver Surfer
The sex it just makes all the issues irrelevant
I know it’s all about to go
So I just sit back and blow my dro
