[Liffy Stokes]
In the Chi, it's kill or be killed, hussle or die
The pain that I'm going through 'til I'm sitting on millions
I need to stack now, I will pay for my sins later
We ride hundred G cars, in it like the world is ours
But it's so hard to make cheese especially
If you ain't got no Ph.D. or connect on phat keys
So don't come to the Chi, it's just risky as hell
Cause K-Town niggas'll bomb on that ass like a stealth
Psycho Drama
invented the style
Then damn near everybody took it and passed it around
But we run a reason around these bitches
The more tapes we make the more they all go broke, so fuck 'em
[Twista]
get the mask and the chrome
Ouija board
G's and Lords,
nine-millies and swords
art of war
look into your eyes, all I see is a bitch
Saw Krayzie in New Orleans
scary vic
Kill the Hoes of the Harmony
four-fee's
bleed from the braids
first on the month
Eazy-E
Bone Crusher
