Dear love I was thinking how I should be starting this
Mean difference of ways still I can light you like an arsonist
Put my heart in this particularly funny
I hope you stayin'alone I'm into
Don't be playin' me wrong I'm too grown for games
found some
Stick
that's cuz I'm in the beyond
hit
(get it wet)
Gimme some tang and alize
(get it wet)
(get it wet)
Last time I heard you was playing with emotions and po' pimpin'
All up in the clubs smokin' doves fuckin' hella women
Smooth head got you right in the bed you need another lover like you
Need a hole in the head
Instead of all this talkin let your tongue do the walkin' on down this
Clitoris
Fuckin' with a wild hundreds bitch
wet
it won't take a gang of gifts just to hit this
Come take a little glimpse of these sweet hips
When that ass in the air cause an eclipse
far from a virgin
I'm urgin' but I ain't thinkin' you can get it yet
Then nigga come hurt me baby with a splash
Aggression of nana I've never had
As I enter the scene with
aroma fresh cologne all that carob on
