Here I am motherfuckers, thought I was gone, huh?
Y'all just gonna take my shit and run wit it, huh?
my adrenaline still pumpin'
Standing in the midst of a hundred thousand haters
Dynamite and C-4 strapped around the waist bloody tears in my eyes
Hit the switch making sure any motherfucker in the vicinity blow away and die
Kill'em off with an explosion get up bitches
Kamikaze on you hoes I'm the sacrificial lamb
Feelin the fury flow out of every follicle in my body
blunt
I'm uppin the itchy for fuckin wit Twista
If you fuckin wit me come and bet fifty
Cause it won't be an issue
The hollows penetrate through your tissue
Fuck your fit up wit your blood
As I hear the cries of yo homies screamin revenge, got no mercy on them either
I'll murder you and come at you again in the after life
My brother you can't bring harm wit guns
I'm armed wit bombs fuck all that shit you carry I got your obituary
Til they put all of us in a cemetery
Now come and look into the mind of a man you don't really wanna fuck wit
(Kill'em All, Kill'em All, Kill'em All)
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
Go to war like I'm untouchable
2 deadly fingers squeezing twin triggers steady touchin you
Pop 17 sins out the gun clip
Smoking dro so fire I was on 10 after 1 bligg
Nigga you have now entered the chainsaw massacre
Takin more blood than a 2000 dracula
Jesus of Nazareth
A 7 day theory like makaveli
Wit a Mack in the back of the pelle
I'm comin back after they bury me
Celebrate and salute the sign of a suicidal soldier
Better become a bible holder
Careful or you die standing vertical
Even if I gotta murder me to murder you
Suicide on you hoes if I have to, to make you die bitch
