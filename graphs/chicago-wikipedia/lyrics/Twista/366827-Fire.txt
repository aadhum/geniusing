Now I know it's been a long time
Since a muthafucka' done made a good song about reefa'
And who better for you to handle this
Than the T, the number 1 analyst on the cannabis sativa
trippin' on me 'cuz I was sloppy
I be smokin' four different kinds of kush
It's the best of me especially the Purple and the OG
But ya'll might call it the Granddad
Better savor it and take a pull slowly
Me-a rock to the Reggae music whenever me-feelin' spliff workin'
Kill off any rude boy, if you take away my herb that's a Earth's sin
Me and you could hook up and go get a ounce
And I got two-fifty on it
I be higher than giraffe pussy when I'm up in the West
Smell good lemme' hit that
That's why Micheal Phelps did that
