If a nigga talkin shit I’m quick to hit em in the mouth
Niggas can’t see me I’m ray Charles or a eclipse
Stevie in the blackout
Cuz my lyrics be too quick they call me Twista Pacquiao
Can’t nobody fuck wit me the planet is celibate
Wit a thick bitch, go head check out my cargo
Am I like Jason or am I like Michael Myers?
Takin flames to the head like I’m Nicolas Cage
I ghost ride
Any niggas dat try to get me is finna get sprayed
