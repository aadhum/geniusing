Locker room they getting ready, all jury called, getting heavy
Fish nets and them high heels, we team Louis, we team Gucci
No Pelle, all Bentley's, no Chevy's, all titties
Looking deadly and that pole clean, stage name and a nose ring
Shoeboxes like four weeks from four blocks, bring the whole thing
Basketball money is so long, rap money only lasts four songs
Dope money, still a king here and they cornered us so they go home
Feeling good, I'm feeling, my mama watch my children
They ain't really out here getting paid
But these niggas out here rapping my life
Now rap boy come show respect to that lifestyle that he rap 'bout
That platinum card mean good credit, but street credit don't max out
She super loose, she super fine, doing loopty-loops in those pole climbs
D.A. they filming, I ain't going cause I'm brilliant
Kilo, quarter million, no free throws, no spinach
Such a feeling when it's dope money in the building
These money motivated romances that a pay your rent for like a whole year
Devil all up in this bitch, that's why I ain't bring my soul here
Byproduct of them drug times, if we leave then the club dies
And maybe pop it for some tickets to the game
