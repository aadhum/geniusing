I can never leave the hood
I'm a city sticker
Like lower right-hand corner
My city slicker like Billy Crystal
Wrist full, of the crystal ball
I predict through
A political prisoner, imprisoned for passing out
Anti-political literature
Tapes full of that revolutionary curricular for you to listen to
Psychiatrist's couch, straight jacket
Bubble walls, and a foam mouth
I move K packs crazy, pack heat
Lay back like back seats in Maybach Mercedes
Or go back like Eight-Track
I could never respect if I ever regressed
In the belly of the beast
I'm sincere for sure
