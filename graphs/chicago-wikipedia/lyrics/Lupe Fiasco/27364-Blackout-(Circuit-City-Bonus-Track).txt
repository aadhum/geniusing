I'm feelin' like, I ain't feelin' right
I'm feelin' like, I'm finna fly
Right in the sky, unidentified
Flying object, that I sit inside
You can get a ride, just get in line
Hand by your heart, like memorize
Ask Scotty please, could you energize?
Beam on up, to the Enterprise
From the inner city, or the Windy City
Where's Mini-mini? Not Mini-me's
Only Mini-me's
In a straight jacket, but it's Romanelli
So don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind
I don't front hard, I ain't got a mind
But a different team, F&F rules
from the Westside
'Til it's permanent, like pimp hair
Got an empire, I'm the emperor
While I Ottoman, or a Laz-E-Boy
if you don't know the movies
I ninja vanish, Michael Dudikoff
