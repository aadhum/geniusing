Go by many slang name's and sobriquets
Asking me how many lines is in my mind
Is like asking how many fish can the ocean fit
the impossible like an open fist
A rhyming Chaucer
Battle Jay Elect? Who has the foolhardy audacity to utter this?
I look at him like a high minded brother from another and when we finally encounter
Friend Of The People
Fuck the government...
