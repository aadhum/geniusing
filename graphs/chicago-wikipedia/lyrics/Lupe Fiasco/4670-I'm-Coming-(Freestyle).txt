They trynna hit me in my head like Koopa
But I move like Super
With the hood on my shoulder like Bazookas
early
I'm waking up the roosters
Until they late, and they waking up the future
You see, I grew up around rootas of the tootas
I rephrase
I mean supporters of the snortas, I retraces
Become recorder of the corner
I set Madison on fire, like the looters in '92
You can pick it up off the floor like Hoovers
A newcomer, locin' with 2 numbers
The holidays of the hustler
I be a Huckleberry Doc Holiday with the peacemaker
I'm coming
'bout my money shot like West Coast productions
