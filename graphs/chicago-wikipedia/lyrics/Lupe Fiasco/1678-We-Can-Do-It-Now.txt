Bring it back like a typer-writer, writing that
All my old wounds have all healed but they still feel like they new though
And everytime I see ‘em I start to think of you yo
Never miss the city of the wind that I’m in
City of the wind that I’m in
Hit the ground and bounce back up, just like B-Ball
Stickers say Barack on the range
I’m from the Chi’ too, now I’m Barack in the game
