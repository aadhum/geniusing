(uh) I stuck with it
Like the plastic on my moms couch
(all i got to show for )
All these people i drive out
I am the end of days
See you let this plague
On the wing of the Enola
If i get it crackin'
You better expect tentacles
Homie I can multiply
You could have sent ten of you
Talk about New York, but still wear the Mecca
You don't know the time
Like you still wearing Mecca
Shorty screaming like she in the hentai biz
I will burn your house down
Like its left eyes crib
And then move your family
Up to where left eye lives
Respect on the rise, but the money stay still
I'm 28 sitting on 28 bills
Also something to understand
What I say is ice trays
And Muffin pans also everything other than's
Well lets call it baked Alaska
Sriracha on the rocks a frozen yogurt on the woks
Stop
Even rejection is perfection when i'm thru with rhymes
They cut the floors out my cutting room
Just to make them out the doors of the Guggenheim
Raps catholic church
Discarded bars would kill just to get back in my verse
Yeah, even my wrong turns is a better way
Long term i just come around the corner like the letter J
Snakes after I just like a G and a Joe
Take it from me, I'm a bit crazy
And You could hear it from the hoes
Like Dick Tracey
