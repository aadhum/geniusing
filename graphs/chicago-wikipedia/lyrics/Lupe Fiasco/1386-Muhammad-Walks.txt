A'udhu Billahi min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem. Bismillah-i'r Rahman-i'r Raheem
Allahu Akbar (x4)
This is one's for all my brothers and sisters who died in Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan
And Moses split the sea
I ain't tryin' to profit off the prophets so this one's for free
In the Quran they call him Isa
Don't think Osama and Saddam is our leader
so we fall for the illusions of the beast
So instead of tryin' to teach we show our teeth
Same God, different beliefs
Hijabs, Sunday clothes, yarmulke, kufi, same mission beneath
We all tryin' to get to where the sufferin' ends
In front of the Most High bein' judged for our sins
Can't front for the Most High
You, every bee, bird and tree, he, her and me
We virtually on the same boat
With the same goats, on the same sea
Tryin' to stay afloat, and put the devil in the yoke
With a couple of God's quotes
Ash-had an la ilaha illa llah
Astaghfirullah
And to the sisters and the mothers of ours
Who cover theyselves cause they're lovers of God
During Hajj, we walk
through Ramadaan, we starve
Though you not eatin', there's a feedin' of the mind
A defeatin' of the demons, a seein' of the signs
A leanin' on the lines from the surahs
Getting purer
God deemed it unclean
(There's no eatin' of the swine)
Nor drinkin' of the wine
We all bend to his whims
I’m cordial to Mr. Norful, Mrs. Adams you’re the theme song when I’m battling
Creflo, player, what’s happening? I can hear the truth in your rappings
(No)
Sex before you marry
No grudges
You should carry, no lyin'
Not supposed to be gamblin'
(I know it sounds familiar)
We all the same man
It's all a game
The devil hate each and every one of us exactly the same
sall Allāhu ʿalay-hi wa-sallam)
Akh's
deen
But don't forget the blessin' is in the struggle
Most Forgiving
will forgive it if you stay repentant
salats, your zakats, your Quran
miskeen
Astagfirullah
Allah forgive us all
For we all are sinners
Bless us to be among the winners
When it ends
I ain't tryin' to sell it can be brought for free
This is how it is
Now how it ought to be
