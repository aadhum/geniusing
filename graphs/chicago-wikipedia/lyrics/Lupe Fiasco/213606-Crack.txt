I got that killer shit, I got that killer shit
Killer shit
Villainous hero don't give a shit
Hancock, Will Smith
Adrenaline, with a twist
Take pride that I'm so Chi
These young bucks just a nuisance
To my sidekicks
This shit here like magic
Yeah, this here like magic
Abracadabra: rabbits
No hook but so hooked
Take a crack at my habits
Neutron but too bomb
Did it all with no tablets
It's a write off if it costs right
Get your light blue
Then the off white
[Hook: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, get it, get it
Make me lose my mind girl
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it - bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go
No fares, dope fiends
Don't try that nose sting
Police rushed in
And they red lights, they got rocks and
Code D, codeine
On that James Dean, call it James Dean
Say watch that, watch that
You might die driving the same thing
Same thing, same thing, whoop whoop -- see that shit?
Triple entendre no accident
Might crash trying to catch this shit
Contact if you catch a whiff
While you uppercut
Shoryuken fuck it up
Nigga let 'em hit it raw
Send it through your system through a car antenna
Make her actually feel it when it lands deeply in her jaw
[Hook: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, get it, get it
Make me lose my mind girl
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it - bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go
Higher from the back, fire from the top
Fire to the buyer to the tryer of the rock
Supplier to the buyer to the driver of the drop
Lighter to the higher, to the writer to the cops
Police raid, trap hot
Police state, black plot
Drier than the fire so theres violence a lot
Price is going higher so they're firing the shots
That's your girl, I could X that, by any means, I get it clean
One last hit, and that's it, she won't act it, can't intervene
[Hook: Chris Brown]
I ain’t fucking with you come on, noooo
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it, get it, get it
Make me lose my mind girl
I can see it, I ain’t fucking with you
Come on, noooo, yeah-eh
Baby all you wanna do is hit it, hit it
Get it - bang, bang, bang
Fuck me real good tell me that you'll never let me go
