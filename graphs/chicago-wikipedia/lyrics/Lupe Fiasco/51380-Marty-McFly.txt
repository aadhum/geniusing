Busy let's see what this inspire
And then start stealin', when I'm finna be fire ya see
Electric lines I'm six wires higher
Can't hang sneakers from me, I'm doin' my thing
And you can't see the money Mister McGuire
But you can see the rider on his spit fire tires
R.K.F. attired
out shooting at the snakes like leather neck man
You got the game messed up gotta press reset man
Or you can just ask for me and ill put you up on it like channel 3
Step stuttered like ca-ca-ca crambo g
it was mean especially if im looking for a stream
Mc’s ain't see me like I was hidden on speak note
Momma said I was special but theres only one eye like a peek hole
Now its growing on me like creep show
Haters want to put x’s in my eyes like cars
But before
I let it happen I go back before the action happen with factions
That want to make a model out I
Pull up in the coupe
And get the drop up on your troops
Me and my homies in the booth mister marty mcfly fly
Hardy Har my army and I
Burn like Dame pouring a bottle on a model
And got some mami in the eye
