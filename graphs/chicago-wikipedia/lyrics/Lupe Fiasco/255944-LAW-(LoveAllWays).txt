I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I don’t wanna be here by myself
But I’m just like you, and you don’t wanna be by yourself
Wanna put my name on it, but don’t wanna end the friendship
'Cause that’s a declaration, of independence
Would you lie for it?
Would you die for it?
Put fireworks all inside of that sky for it?
Would you wait for me, then get away from me?
'Cause the finish line is exactly where you start
So I’ll run around this whole bitch, just to end up where you are
Now that’s real shit, treadmill shit
I’m Treadstone but I feel shit
That’s Bourne knowledge, yes you are, you just gon' have to believe
That we 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
And we all in this, no half-steppin', we high heel
All inches, high yield, small interest, hell yeah
And you look 4'2", look forward boo, don’t look down at your heels
Don't matter what's at stake, just let it burn, don't e'en look down at your grill
And babe, I'm 'bout to go to work so these niggas gon' have to leave
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
She don't want no soft nigga, she just don't want no false nigga
Daddy can be a gangsta, just can't be no lost nigga
Snapback is great, but you're 'bout to graduate
Take your hat off nigga
Tiger did 'cause Tiger could
But if Tiger couldn't then Tiger wouldn't
That's a billion dollars off golf, nigga
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
I just wanna be here alone, alone
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Tell me, how do you feel?
