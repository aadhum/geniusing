Uhh, I just need a minute to replenish who I am
And who I am is so dependent on exactly where we stand
I stand in any pose, anythin' but tippy-toes
Don't want you to feel smaller, always taller
Now I'm a cheerleader, she a baller
The difference in height isn't aight,
I left my ego at the altar
Is comin' back around to me, just like revolvers
And every single click is just hammerin' it home
Who knew Russian Roulette involved answerin' the phone?
One of your short nodes, might blow my fuckin' brains out
We were like, if a tree falls in the forest and
No one is around, does it really make a sound?
That's romantic and profound, but now
We're like lumberjacks holdin' the axes that brung it down
So I'm now on your message, talkin' 'bout "Remember?"
Silence in return, that sound like 'Timber!"
And in our prehistorics, the flowers was rootin' for us
Brontosaurus ate the flowers, T-Rex ate the Brontosaurus
And then the T-Rex turned around and ate the florist
That's why I lost my FTD endorsements
My sadness' a snitch, my melancholy informant
Despair wears a wire, my longin' rappin' a song
My worry is a rat, my lonely tappin' the phone
My tears run off your shoes (yeah)
Like waters from a goose
Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco
If it's dead and flatten line, I'll leave a message at the beep
