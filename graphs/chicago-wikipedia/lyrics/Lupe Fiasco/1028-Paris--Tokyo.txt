I know, I know but I gotta get up outta here, you know?
I gotta go pay these bills, I got a show to do, you know?
One time, for your mind
Fall in love in Chicago
I love her and I hate to leave her lonely
Ring ring went the iPhone, it was my homie
He said, let's hit Japan
if we can make 'em jam
We can make a hundred grand
Spend it in the south of France
Nothing further, I jumped
Grabbed my
Goyard trunk
Got ready to "Walk it Out" like Unk
In my John Lennon Chucks
That's when I heard murder
You're killing me, you're filling me with sorrow
Sunrise, goodbyes and missing you tomorrow's
I turn to see my dream
Love supreme
queen, meanest thing on the scene
I drop my bags in a flash, that's faster
That's 180 on that dash, shirt to dry her tears
And wipe the rain from my dear like Dasher
You's the dame who's the username to all my passwords
The reason I get fly is Ibn Jasper
I even keep your picture in my passport
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
So let's keep it, real
all in together, free Chill
Tell the stewardess to throw a movie on the reel
Heat up my kosher meal, exchange my dollar bills
Don't wake me till I land, when they barely understand
What I speak, but they nod to my beats
I tell my fans who I am, and they stand, and they clap
They applaud. They love me, my God
Otsukaresama deshita
or maybe au revoir
A spree on Saint-Honor√©,
then back to Charles de Gaulle
So I can get home and tell her everywhere that I been
And, everything that I done, and
Tell her that she's the one, and, um
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Guess who's back in the, house
With a bunch of souvenirs and a smile for your mouth
I really missed you, each and every night I kissed ya
In my dreams fore I went to sleep to la la land to count them sheep
It's got to be a prophecy for us to stay together ever more
For better or, less or poor
Or worth our weight in buried treasure, X's on the shore
I know my world tour's like war to ya
But Ian said, "Aloha", and Harley said, "Cheers"
Julian said, "Bonjour", Big O was like, "Yeah"
Amanda and Le Messie want to know when we going there
Edison
sends his love, so does the rest of the club
Of the international playboys and playgirls
But I revoke my membership, all for My Tenderness
She said, Pursue your interests, cause even if I'm ticketless
I'll be there, by your side
In your heart and, on your mind
So, as I taxi down another runway
I gotcha
Let's go to sleep in Paris
Wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans
Then we can land in the motherland
Camel-back across the desert sand
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
Wherever I go she goes
