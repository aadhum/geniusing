The champ is here
Flow can't be seen
Like it took one in the face
I'm heavy nigga, tow can't be seen
Like I'm repossessing a Chevy nigg
those can't be safe
Even in they panic rooms
I will soon be forest to the floor of this
Stethoscope to the door of it, listenin' for the break
And I don't care how long gettin' the combination takes
I be concentratin' on the crack, get it straight
I was so high up the food chain that which I mentioned before
I ain't know how to make
I Master Shake like Aqua Teen Hunger Force
Already number one in the hood G
one of the coldest you gonna run across
Like it was stolen from a under boss
Spent for stack and sold to another boy
He might never get it back
So whoever got it gettin' whacked if they ever get caught
Now that's what I call reaction to a chain snatchin
Game got 'bout as much compassion as The Passion
So it gotta make a comeback, just like a champion
I run it back to that last piece of action
My necklace was took-en (took in) by detective
I don't stress it I just gather up my essence
Back to floor/flow like crunchin
Got a 6 pack on the low now I'm sunk in
Look like I'm driving from the back seat
With a bird shotgun like I'm huntin'
You see what happened
I made a call, and she got fly
I was pumpin', hit her up
Then I sent my dog to go and pick her up
WIC
To all my niggas in the CCDOC waiting on they quick collect to come
In the abdomen is Madison from which I came, but this my gang
FNF crew, first and fifteen
Bear arms like Lebatt Blue
Oh yes it's bullets in the toasters as many as the clips that the gun hold
And they itching to come up out the magazine like the posters that unfold
So my heat like Tigerbeat
I got the shotgun in the driver's seat
So if Lupe's a coupe, my man is a sedan
If there's more than 2 of us, then you up against a van
If I'm leavin, then you leavin
If your niggas wanna come, y'all can ride with me
It's just gonna be a lot of squeezing
Ya understand
That I don't need Caroline calculator to divide defeat
Just lean a little closer
The flows are his as roses is
So override your pride and decide retreat
It's suicide to me
Like a broke stock broker and a sidewalk
Y'all niggas ain't fly as me
That's why I defy physics and y'all niggas collidin', peace
I'm up here with the Lears
Y'all down down there with the airs
Emperors in the mirror, you're playin' with a pair
Nigga I is we,
twice the MC like mc squared
Trust, I make it relate
I got the poker-face and I'm hiding a flush
Still ridin' the beat
With a air that still smells like roses from Andre 3000
My housing surroundings is what made me me
And that's two times the G
You see how I doubled that the third time, nigga please
