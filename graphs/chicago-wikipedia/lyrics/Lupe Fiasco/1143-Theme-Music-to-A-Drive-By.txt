Cuz no one does it better
I said do it, do it, cuz no one does it better
What down Charlie?
Good, hey what up Joe?
I said nah man, there's people out there better than me
I just do what I do, you know what I'm sayin? Yeah aight
Ugh, I can't feel a field nigga pain
Devious skill that make a strong willed nigga wane
Since a lil nigga hang with the killers and distributers of 'caine
They dismemberers of swishers then refill it with the jane
Then they tilt it and they lit with a flame then they took a pull of killer
To tha brain like (inhale noise) ah
Evil minded like Crane they became
They deranged like the rover that I rode
That was the Range that I drove when I was a little bit older mayne
Declaring war on the deck like they the joker all wild
Duckin from bruce wayne
While they polka with the devil in a moonlitten ghetto
Hello My Name stickers on the stickers of the veins
In rehab remembering the feelings when they used to get mellow
When they was all back of a nickel like Monticello
When the underworld had to be smarter than donatello
No honor amongst fellows
It's harder than sittin with a blind man and tryin to describe yellow
Got me feelin like killer joe
My life the album
Know the classics by heart and exactly how the filler go
Repeat it on my way to the liquor store
Cause I can't feel the field niggas chains
Though I covet mine, so I covered mine in blame
Then I bumped into a bum and covered mine in shame
Then I bumped into a hun and uncovered mine again, minor game
Diamonds then underminded mayne
they give a nigga with no mack another kinda game
See money talks in another kinda slang
Detectives can't decipher as they listen through the wire as I accept the call
And listen to the lifer
Gettin religion and makin wudhu in the sink of your cell
Recitin Al-Fatiha in the kitchen
In deed on his deen and in addition to doin dishes
Listen as I give school on the rules to rule
The Fuel of fools, the obstacles, the cool
Had to slow it down homey
Chopped and screwed
Blow it down for me
Sticks and stones make the homes
Only God's words can stop the wolves
And don't fraternize with pigs those kids will think your stool
Not at the bar but tryin to put him behind the bar like a bartender
He laid the law like the bar so I put it in a bar for dude
He said borrow my jewels and bar the fools
Cuz they a play ya like the space bar in tools
