As I bug out and absorb this energy
Refer to my memories, the scenes of lines and rhymes
To put together for these times
Right of the top like suicide jumpers landed on your block
Ahhh...and do pauses like that and do ad-libs to stretch
To prefer that I'm the bestest more like a suggestion
But maybe it's the truth..
still falling of the roof
Thought I was dead but didn't hit the ground
Call the police and hit the pound
It's not 911 on your dial-tone son
It's a write around with a smile infront
See I do it like my flow when I was in '92 when I was in school
When I was rapping like Ghostface Killah with a higher baritone
With a ghost chain wallet and a megaphone zone
It can't nobody stop when the dreads grown long
So I'mma keep it Marley and never sip barely
The beer be the poison the food and the liquor
And you watch study the moves of the niggas
With mac tucked in with a strap bring it back
See I messed that up there but then the best up here
Service ya hit ya like a burglar
Cat when I'm sneaking through the back with ya purse
That's a man with lady bag maybe drag maybe fag
But more no less homo
no zone goals deeper than mine when
I'm in time to climb to commit crimes
Every time I rhyme
Chi town a second it so I'm like President Obama
When I'm ripping it maybe a terrorist maybe embarasses us
And call me what I am like nas i'mma a don
So word to the homie in the hero never zero
And I move and I disappear representing like
Shapiro in court, you still might lose
I get punshed but I still don't bruise
Every body tryna rock but I'm Chi-ca-goin in
Shout to common and Kanye West 2 times 2 rhymes
I'm still Ramadan
I still do it like nuclear warheads fore-heads is full of these lyrics
And when I come through up you better put your vest up
When I be kicking and spitting and ripping it
See that's a little Laissez-faire like I don't care
I move you round like the nets to brooklyn
And if you want more then just push it and i'll be there
Rocking kicking and hitting and spitting and ripping it down
And doing things and I might give you a pound
I'm giving out more knowledge
To drop it's like school and a college
And a university it's like two of me inside this
with the froid gased up and the lamborgini too
I'mma ride around stunning on you and your crew
shouts to CL Smooth and homie Pete Rock
Pause he trackin' that, stamina and everything is bandaged up
Bandager
worldstarhiphop-ing
me and funk master flex
And in flex we trust every body bless up yup
