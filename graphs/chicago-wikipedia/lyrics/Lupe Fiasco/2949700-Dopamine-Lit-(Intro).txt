Yeah, and it got a soul, yeah
Uh-uh, what it do? What it say?
Yeah, yeah, DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say?
Yeah, yeah, DROGAS, DROGAS, what it say?
What it say, DROGAS, DROGAS
Yeah, yeah, yeah
DRO', DRO', DRO', trap, trap, DRO', DRO'
DRO', DRO', DRO', nigga, uh
What it say? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Blood rushin' to my head like cold
Players on my mind like Shake'
Plays on my mind like stage
Stays for a while like fades
Fades to the black like Jay
Wavin' from behind like Ks
Made it from behind like AIDS
Made it to the map like Waze
Can't take you back like trades
Bae shake it in my lap like Jackie
Joyner-Kersee havin' seizures, Jesus
What's a nonbeliever to a preacher?
This ain't the kind of rap the opps and the thots like
Told Trak put the bat back on the spotlight
Cartagena, serve snacks at the cockfight (realest)
Need new batteries for the Glock lights (realest)
Put the mix on the oil 'til it lock tight (realest)
Try Containment Unit, the walls, they can't fit us
Who the Ghostbusters gon' call to come get us?
Ayy, over-D off of this
But baby, don't die 'til the dopamine hit, yo
Ayy, this one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Jackin' like Jill for a pill at the Hollywood Hills, though
Fame is a dr-it-ug
I want my name all lit up
Over-D off of this
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey
Big watch, big watch, you can see it
Lot of diamonds in the Cartier
'Less I'm thinkin' 'bout the money, I can't concentrate
Don't talk if you ain't ball enough to commentate, yeah
That's a Super Bowl every time I contemplate
Limited edition, bitches
I'm just livin' off the interest
I don't really care about niggas
Denzel, put the money in the blender
For the esés, shower posse with the SKs
For the haters that be hatin' on the Jefés
Half-naked hoes, they be dressin' just like X-rays
Rated, all the way through, don't like nothin' plated
Simps think they got cool, I'm just stickin' to the basics
This-this-this-this-this-this-this
This one ain't for Billbo'
You can stream the album on Silk Road
Drug rings for more dough
So they baggin' like Bilbo
Over-D off of this
But don't fall asleep 'til the dopamine hit, hey
