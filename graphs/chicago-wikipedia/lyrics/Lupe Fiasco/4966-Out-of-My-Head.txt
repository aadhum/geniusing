Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
everythin' hooks
you're a real good chorus
I'm a real good verse, freestyle unrehearsed
clean, no curse
And when the song's gone, man everythin' hurts
So I put it in reverse, go back to the scene where I seen you first
Yeah, I need you to sing that single again
Play that video I seen you up in
A hundred million spins in my mind all day
Callin' requests on the line always
Yeah, the president of your fan club
Leave them players all behind like a band love
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
Playa need a minute
Like a time out in tennis '
fore I finish
How'd I get in this
maybe 'was your hair, maybe 'was your flair
Maybe it's the heels and the way you wear
Maybe it's you're real and the way you care
You don't care if I'm ill or a millionaire
The only thing that matters that the feeling's there
Your smile's so bright it's like a grill's in there
High off life, don't need a pill in there, nah
You're killin' me, I think I need a will in here
Got me feelin' real skills impaired
Hard to describe why you're still in here
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
Don't care what nobody say 'cause I like it girl
Might go crazy tryna figure this out love
Caught up in something that I can't get out of
But we like it girl
Girl, I want you to know
I don't even know what you did, you did you did, but I love it
Lupe, Trey
I can't get you out of my head, my head
