Simplified love-sick, taking no prisoners
Sunny day, cold heart, listen up listeners
Dark side love affair out of time and in the rush
You can't hold it until the sun rise settin up
Let's levitate up over the horizon
I can see it in your eyes
Everything you're hiding
I can see the truth in you
Even when you're lying, even through the darkness
I can see you shining
A played out love song playing in the background
Seems to describe every part of where were at now
Every feeling that we ever had for each other
Every karaoke love letter, lyrics undiscovered
Now your mother used to tell me you ain't nothin' but some trouble
Now some couple trouble makers making mayhem on the double
I can see the truth in you even I know that you're lying
Throw away the darkness, I wanna see you shining
