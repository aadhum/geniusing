See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
It drops without
Then without doubt I'm without drought
What's that I came to say? Get it wet like Training Day
Lupe got him an H and K
And handle that Heckler, Kramer way
Aight, nigga, put the game away
You mean like rain delay?
She said, "If I pop it then you gotta pay me"
So I make it rain for the ladies
Off that, skin where mosquitoes can't walk at
In the club, I golf that
We gettin' cold, better salt that
In my brain, it is stormin'
When it rains, it is pourin'
swat at bats
Commissioner Gordon, not a sportsman
reigns
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
See this shit go 'round and 'round
Hope you get up to speed and you're alright
All I ever wanted was the dove view
And all the people elevated, stay high
High, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
More than high, high, elevated
All I wanna see my niggas sittin' on top
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, more than high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
High, high, high, high
Why you be as quiet as a DP with an oral?
Why on TV it's adorable?
In 3D it be horrible
You all finna carnival
Through balls, think about to fall
Get a new doll to my boo, aw
trampoline, flow lift you off of your feet
