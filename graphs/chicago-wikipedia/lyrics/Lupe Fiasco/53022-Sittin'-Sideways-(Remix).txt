Or you gotta run anyway after you drop the folks

Sittin' sideways, paused in a daze

You know the boy slam Bentley doors
I been riding Lexus since '94
Before I had a deal I was on a world tour
In a town near you showed up with raw
Fast forward a couple years I growed up some more
Closed up the store, sewed up the floor
Rose up the charts, sold up with the 4
Sold 5, sold 6, sold 30 more
Now I'm a kilo in the game like I was before
My life repeating like words in the corridor
Before I open the door you let me know if you are close kinfolk with the law
If not let's further explore
Same shit different toilet, yeah, I know you heard it before
I was the youngest of four, pop couldn't take it no more
Stayed together for the kids they couldn't fake it no more
Left me naked in the streets I had to take me a course
Not only made me a man, it made me a boss
The world chico, maybe it's yours
Just be a man of your word, you got your word and your balls
