You know its hard liquor
Rock steady from the start sister
Since I stepped on the set like Godzilla
Since I stepped on the scene
It's been nothing but him hustling
Old schooling, instruction was mean
As I lean back like limbo
In 6 4's like Nintendo's
Don't intervene chumps
Y'all far from the hood like limousine trunks
Man, I'm up front with the pumps
And I squeeze in the cars like a mini full of clowns
Or a coupe full of Klumps
Many put it down but
Lu from the jump been producing that crunk
Comp can't hold it down, they ain't fatter then me
This is no seesaw
They can't see me like I'm 4 feet tall
Standing behind a 4'3" wall
Believe me I'm on the low
I do a little balling like BB
I get big like toadstools
Then I might jump into a coupe and its back to being small
I get little
If you can't purchase you can still juke like work it
I will foot work like percolate
the west suburbs makes the best hustlers: Was!
