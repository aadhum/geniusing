I feel a little bit forgiven, Thank God
Allow me this day
I don’t play, me and Tim, me and him
Relaxing in the club, DJ’ing
They don’t know what happen
at the bucket I say fuck it
I’m on my Dean, you be on a dean-diet
I stay on it, I strong as Popeye with some spinach
You wish you could, but you just kid
I’m a grown man on it, my own man on it
Come in your house, now your home damn haunted
See everybody dead, bullet holes in the head
But I ain't kill em, I hit em with the flow instead
My flow like bullets, they like hollow tips
I wish you would if you could, if you would try it
But you can’t so back to denying the
They be lying ah
I be so up on my truthless and I’m so
ruthless
Ferrari top down
New Ferrari 400i, that blue kit
So I got my rims and my watch and my rings on
Yeah I got my bling on
Go ahead and sing songs
If you want I tell no tales and no lies
Shout to Chilly chill, I’m so really real
See my brain just flows and see just how I goes
And I’m from Chicago and I’m letting niggas know
Or send it through the strainer but please don’t waste it
Make sure you clean the plates when I’m done cooking
I’m Lil B
I am big ME, you little he
Indeed, it’s the LUP, Tim Westwood on our BBC Business
