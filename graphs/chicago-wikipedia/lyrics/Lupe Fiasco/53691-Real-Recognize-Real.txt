They say real recognize real
Frauds is thoroughly camouflaged and fatigued in the field
Be careful who you believe,
the pills
Is dealed like flaccid
proceeds go towards the buying of caprice classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon stepping off into traffic
Like, check him, tears roll down the eyes
Of the rides inside of a funeral procession
Here lies, with X's in his eyes, the unguided misdirected
Squad cars roll past and laugh
They say the streets is a demon in a dress
With dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath, uh
Aging badly, in sunglasses, she pretty
Slain boyfriends names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinkling greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a philly
Hennessey tears, ass'll bring ya enemies here
Flirt with her flaws till you run up in her raw
Verse 3
They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and
hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears
Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers
a system for a heart
Rap music for beats
heroin for a son and
it's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps
Loves life cause he likes when it dies
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
He knows, he's clever, jail is his house
All the liquor that's poured out, goes right in his mouth
Rides around on a stray bullet;
With prostitutes, pimps, dope dealers, and killers tied to it to pull it
And he's known to ride around with the feds
But, righteousness is a father teaching his kids
That what's better than wealth, is the respect in the self
A pistol-packin' old lady standing up to the dope dealers
On the block, making sure her presence is felt
A teacher teaching that thinking is cool
Listen, before you mention "not letting school turn em' into fools"
