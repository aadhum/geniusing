Readily, I come through and break the game down
Yeah, I take your name down
As well I'm graffiti artist writing over your name
Uh, and see I do it hard
See my flow naked as the WorldStar girls are
And Semtex blow it up
And Sway is the homie
And L-U-P sure got skills
But take off the "S", I kills
And put it on the end
Uh, I'm so fluid like fluoride in the water make you dumb
Don't step into my party unless you got a vest on
Cause I'm throwing shots from the DJ booth
And taking off my roof in my Ferrari when I step through
Rest In Peace Esco
My brother much love
I hope God bless you up above
And I'm walking like a Crip
But I'm feeling like a Blood
And I don't wanna be Big Meech or Larry Hoover
I wanna be Martin Luther King, Jr
Yeah, see that's BMF Freestyle
Intelligent rap is so irrelevant
See we don't deal with the nonsense
I'm feeling like Tottenham, like a hot spur
L-U-P in the piece
Peace
