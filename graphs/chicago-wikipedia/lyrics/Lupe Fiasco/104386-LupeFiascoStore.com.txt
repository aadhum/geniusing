Through the coolest nigga
And to perform get a lil’ horn like a newborn unicorn
It’s like miles on a horse
5,280 styles for the source
Then redacted into blackness
We’re like miles from the aisle they had walked
Sail ‘em to the shore just to sell ‘em to be sure
you should come and buy a shirt
Fried chickens tasteless
And watermelons racist
Nigga!
