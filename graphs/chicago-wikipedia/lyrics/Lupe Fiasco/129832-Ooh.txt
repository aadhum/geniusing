Ya hopefully hand over the Land Rover keys
Slowly and run like hosiery
I move eggs like ovaries
Who y'all suppose to be?
None of them close to me, my poetry poison til' they posing me
And little kids poking me openly
Fuck police I slip through they fingers like rosaries
Off the hook with the .38 rotaries
from BIC's to Mont Blanc's
Bump heads for coins like Mario
In South Beach beeches going south with they mouth piece without speech
Go head try and stop it, couldn't block sun with Hawaiian Tropic
They wanna put me in boxes like chocolates...that's nonsense
Nothin' sweet about this but the hotel room Presidential like the wrist
Never rental get mine freeway like Van wyck
Peace to Francis and all my manz(iz)
Take trips to France(iz) where all my manz is
I got a bezel from embezzlin' Good Heavens!
And they said I lost it in 97'
About to start using Mexicans not cause they better than just cause I get Si Senor not I need more
For a hundred grand plus, I'd be buffin' brass Knucks
I'm Gung Ho with them white lines, not the kind that divides traffic
