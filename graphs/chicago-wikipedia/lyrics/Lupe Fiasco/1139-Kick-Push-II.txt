[Intro]
Look at what we did
Came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
Yeah, look at what we did
We came a long way from dirty ghetto kids
[Verse 1]
Well the cops didn't fine 'em for grindin', no
They kinda blew the vibe, figured it was time to go
And he had made like ten dollars off the sign he wrote
It read:
"A lil hungry, and need a lil money
It's for my lil sister and her lil tummy"
Wasn't lying tho, he didn't go buy hydro
Went to the restaurant and bought two gyros
Cause he knew they wasn't cookin' where he live
The kunk-kakunk-kakunks now took him to the crib
A lil hurt from the rail he took into the ribs
Right pass the pushers who couldn't under dig
What's the use of pushin'? You ain't pushin' none of this
If I kick it with y'all I'm just pushin' for a bid
But what was on his mind, and pushed him to the lid
Their best customer wasn't cookin' for her kids
Kick, push
Over his shoulders he swore he'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, and so he
Yeah, you see his mom was a crack head
And his father couldn't be contacted
He lived with being different, was combated
And see his girl was a white girl
But just cause she was white, see her life wasn't light worl
Had a daddy and a mama, but her daddy used to mama hit
Couldn't afford the medicine, pimped her to the pharmacist
Had suicidal feelings,
would ride
Switch over the transition help her conquer it
Kick, push
Over her shoulders she swore she'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
Yeah, uh, that's why she
Yeah, a traveling band of misfits and outcasts
Nod they heads from Misfits to Outkast
A lot of scars, they did this without pads
A lot of hearts who did this without dads
One's father was filthy rich
Two was middle class, and one was homeless
Add in the paralyzed girl in the wheelchair
Who just liked to watch,
and that was the whole clique
I think about 'em every time I see this old flick
That was taken in the park in front of this old bench
They wrote on the back, "You thank for push, kick
Hope you make a video, the beat is so sick"
Well I did, I hope you seen it
It's on MTV,
Soundtrakk's a genius
Love from Tony Hawk,
beef from the Ice Creamaz
Before we put it out, had to pay the Filipinas
Just to show 'em how you
Kick, push
Over ya shoulders you swore you'd never look
Cause wasn't nothing back there, but the blackness
Life wasn't too attractive
