I feel like ammunition for a sling shot
I'm trying to get triple sevens on my slot machine
And knuckle up with time like a ring watch
A Dennis the Menace's weapon of choice
with the windows of his soul
Dead intended on the tinted windows of a Rolls
Now how am I supposed to sit for Mister Wilson
Drop a dime
Before another penny is spent on this game
I can't be leaving this casino, with less than a c-note
Just to see that my Sedan has been vandalized
It don't matter what they say just get the name right
Now that's L as in little, and U as opposite of me
And P as in Pistol and E as in...E
I do my part, chill like barber of Seville
Homie, it's like I'm paid to fade
Hand prints chillin' and my name written where the pavement lay
Then my game is played, 'till I'm rain delayed
far from an actor homes
They trying to de-rail my train of thought
But I'm Bruce Willis, ya'll don't feel it
This is hard black, like where my palms at
Niggas tryin' to pull my card, stop my shift
Shift me to that graveyard and knock my hustle
They hope I Domino and free up my delivery
I'm just trying to do the opposite of left
As long as there is the opposite of death
You test, and I might just bring the opposite of life
Till there's no one the opposite of right
As you bop down writer's block and can't find it...
I address, I correct
You a dress, I'm a pair of pants
I'm a Motorola, you just a pair of cans
Couple Coca Colas and a string
Playa I'm 'bout my green like Martian's skin
