One for the money, and two for the base
Three for the bail, and four for the case
I hops out in my militant way
Fresh Puerto Rican Airs
green Michigan J
Hello my ladies, hello my honeys
Running around like a chicken with his head cut off
The Fifteenth is me
Representing for my New Jacks and all my Jills
Nice... real... tight
All burned like aftershave right after fades
Each for my city, in need for my hood
Some for the bad and she for the good
Go uh, dumb for mour addiction
Pennies for my thoughts, quarters for the flipping
Nerd, I heard that
Four Eyes, been balled that before
They just jealous
What's the perpetuals? Four eyes
Chillin in my race car, gorilla like Bapestar
I lay law
