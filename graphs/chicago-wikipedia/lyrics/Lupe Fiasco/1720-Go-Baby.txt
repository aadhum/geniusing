Where my ladies at?
I said where my ladies at?
Let's find somewhere we can go crazy at
And for you baby I'll be your maniac
And you don't have to worry 'bout nothing
Cause every time I see you baby you'll be rolling with me
Oh i'll be on the sidelines rooting for my dime
Holding up my sign and it say:
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
That's my honey if I give her money she ain't gotta pay me back
No you ain't gotta pay me back
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
She loves me, she loves me more
Amour me, she assures
She adores me
Even when it's up and down like see-saw
Surely, we can start from scratch like default
When they say you're not my baby like Maury
You can tell 'em that they're telling a story
Testify like you're telling a jury
And I'll repeat like you said it before me
And we as heavy as an elephant, aren't we?
Let's take 'em to the zoo, or better yet a safari
They want me to leave my Dame like the fella from Marcy
(No!)
But we go way back like a set of Atari's
From baby fat 'til we skeletons darling
"Me" starring "You" is what it says on the marquee
So let's go give them a show, on my heart, get set, go!
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
And you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
You best believe
That you're my sure-fire, superstar, sure-shot, firecracker
Extravaganza, fantastic, super-size with extra cheese
Yes indeed!
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
Go baby! (Hoo hoo) Go baby! (Hoo hoo)
