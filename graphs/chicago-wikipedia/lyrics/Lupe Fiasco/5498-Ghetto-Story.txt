I say it's enstilled
As I peep from beneath the titled brim of my pinwheel
heavy problems
Genocide desensitized to violence
Makes it hard to sympathize
Harden,
individuals whose feelings is miniscule
Soon become criminals if you dark-skinned
And you was raised in a project apartment
He had to part then, left with only a mother
The family structure suffers
He will soon cling to hustlers, as his guardians
He still a boy, needs to fill a void
marchin'
Up the block up to no good, sellin' in the wrong hood
Last words: Don't let the habitation get ya
The driver side of my Caprice Classic
Steady mobbin'
salt and sour Jays, and blueberry Hugs
Shorties consider a meal, been my feel for it
Sweatin' for a pair of Air Jordans they would steal for
And a gold chain 4 fiends would
Knife, wild and kill yours
Some say the steroids in the chicken is
The cause of the thickening in the young women
Livid,
see some shorties playin' Cops & Robbers, livin'
Bittersweet thoughts is what I had for them
I can picture quota fillin' Police chasin' after them
Catchin' up to, friskin' and askin' them
Where the packs at? Who yo' chief
Is? Where the straps at?
Am I thinking too hard? Or perhaps that's reality
In a project mentality
but through it all
I hope we learn more than how to be
Whores and
how to move a ball
