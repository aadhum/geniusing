George Carlin
was one of the smartest men I've ever heard
Challenged you through his comedy
My brother Dave Chappelle is a genius through his show you saw the proof
Wittily exposed the lies and had us laughing at the truth
Foxworthy
Katt
Chris Rock
Richard Pryor
Dick Gregory
But from your shows it must be told I never learned a fucking thing
Eddie Griffin through his riffin' appeals to a higher sense of purpose
