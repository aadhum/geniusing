Uh, before we get started in this
You know this thing right here
I gotta say
Welcome home
To my main man Chilly Mac
Make sure my foot was good and my hand was pimp
And when them niggas jumped ship
A hand was limp
To try and turn the tide help withstand the stint
The time when it was hectic strictly on the strength
That's why we got moves to make
New records to record, new rules to break
We back standing on two the crew is straight
New and improved FNF crew you snakes
No more visits on Friday, no more commissary, no more collect phone calls
