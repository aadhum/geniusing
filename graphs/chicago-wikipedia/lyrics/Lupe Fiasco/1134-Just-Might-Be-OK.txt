Affirmative no further furnishing is needed
I believe we are completed, dig
We all in agreement on the wall paper
Happy with the color scheme welcome to the crib
A two family Habitat For Humanity with a view of where the insanity live
My vida loca was built like Bob Vila via God
He architected, I arted what I harbored, Jimmy Carter
From Chicago's west side
Finish my construction now we hold the coming like contracepts
I'm conscious
(Ex)cept the cons I kept
With conversations held with the Satan on my shoulder
Which lead to steps that kept me looking over the shoulder
Like chauffeurs, where my angels at
Painful yet Mary I ain't Jerry Garcia ma here but I'm grateful church
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day
It's finna get heavy as heaven
I am Atlas at this manage to balance
Massive masses pull my back with out tilting my glasses
This was not pilfered from passages of OG's
This is so me
Ask us many mention little homie, little bony
But the rhymes is fat
In fact, Just like a Rochester customer
God bless the mothers and younger brothers of hustlers
Cause she don't want sob at his wake
But he want to follow in his steps
Bang his hat, learn his shakes
Master his swagger in the bathroom mirror
Cop a Chevy, steady mob in his place
Chea it's just the problems we face
Look his moms in her face and promise he's straight
We just might be OK, after all
Sun gone shine, on this day
Then he leaves the house that love built that
HUD renovated that section 8 pays for
Well lets pray for em
Let the beat play for em
Put his struggles on display for em
Cause he gotta go and face the drama
With a different face from the one that he use to face his momma
If you look close
You'll see it consist of a smile that hurts, an ice grill, and a trace of trauma
Little bit of his father
Another criterion that's no different from a young Liberian
I ain't nicest MC, I ain't Cornel West
I am Cornel Westside,
Chi-town Guevara
Malcolm eXorcise the demons
Gangster leaning
He traded in his kufi for a new era
Chose a 44 over a mortarboard
I ain't a credited institute graduate
I ain't from Nazareth
My conception wasn't immaculate
I ain't master no calculus
A good addition to the rap audience
I back flipped on the mattress they slept on me on
Whaddown Joe, knowing is half the battle
Fighting temptation, have an apple
Shakes the snakes, pip the system
Let's get into it, tabernacle
