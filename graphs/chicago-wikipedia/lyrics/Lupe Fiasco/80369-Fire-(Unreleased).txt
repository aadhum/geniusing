Especially in front of feds who want to know my where-abouts
Where the house and his stash-box at
How he live where he is who he flash Glocks at
And them hurt play boys drop all types of change so we gotta dog-fight all night with the range its all right
You know I be the all time small nine carrier all across America, quick to bury ya
Who done pulled out more babies than Heathcliff Huxtable
These niggas think they're immune but I got chick-booms that will put them in tribunes, resume
Niggas taking mine not permissible. On visual gon' be physical. Niggas don't believe in God make them spiritual
He make it out that whip it's a miracle
No salad dressing just dress him in his best and bless him I said it so I meant it
Mostly sold to the block
Shop Neimans by the season for the freaks them
I dominate they domino
It's common though typically, lyrically catch yourself slipping with me
I'm quite sinister facing two murders one verbal one vehicular
Whipping ah
No Problemo long as my habitat's in check
