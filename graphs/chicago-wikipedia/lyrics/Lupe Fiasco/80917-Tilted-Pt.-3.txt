I did this, in the memory of a couple of my homies
Couple of your homies. Um, Not acknowledging or glorifying any type of violence or anything type of thing like that
Peace
Southside, Westside, Northside, Eastside
Westside. Haha
I tips my to the left
It's Just the Westside of 'em
Don't ride nothing
First, let me tell you where son grown
Grew up 'round GD's, VL's, Black Souls, and Unknowns
Forced to drop the Forks, or you gotta run home
Or you gotta run anyway after you drop the Folks
Violations, Laws, Lessons, Sessions, & Mandates
throwing they handshakes
GDN in they fades
All Well, All Mighty, All Righty, they all for it
Blue and Black Jordans sportin' might get 'cha applaused for it
Peace Treaty for like a Week if Chief & them Called for it
150 deep in ya' street, & saying y'all broke it
But what started that was a shawty walking down the ave in a starter cap
Pops sayin' he ain't want me no part of that
Those happenings with those hats and things
Move me out south, now,
all my homies is Latin Kings
Teaching me Spanish, Lowrider Magazines, Black & Gold Bandannas, taggin' crowns up on the scene
That was the age, how kinda Lupe was made, homies from Pax Town to Terror, New Era
Uh, See from Youth, I wasn't a stranger
Pops schooled 'em to the El Rukn's, plus the P. Stone Rangers
Couple Arab Knights, and Solid Foes I knew, thought that them Moes was
To my Out of Town Friends, to take off they hat, that they couldn't wear that in the places I was taking them to
My Homies was Breakin' it, so I was Breakin' it, too
If they started chasin' them, then they was chasin' me, too
