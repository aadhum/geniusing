She say she gotta do her nails and condition her hair
Find a pair of shoes and a fittin’ brasier
Slick shorty describe her description it’s fair
But say no other chick in this world can compare
And no other nigga got permission to stare
I say I never listen
Never mention I care
When they gone I never miss em
Never diss em a tear
Cause other women to fill that position is there
She say well things gon change
Now her mission is clear
Let her get off the phone and get off to homes
She knock on the door
It's business from there
Start strippin' her gear and switchin’ her rear
I'm not flinchin'
Cartier on my vision impaired
And enough ice
To condition the air
Now the boy got game and the girl got hurt
The boy got brains and the girl got worth
Cause the boy got fame
Do whatever he say
Now the boy get paged like every other day
[Refrain]
Nobody ever really loved me
It's just the birds and the bees
The her's and the he's
The his the ma’ams
The sirs and the she's
She say she gotta get him dressed and hit him with rules
Feed ‘em breakfast and send ‘em to school
She say she need a rest her mind she finna lose
I tell her recline ke’ and just keep cool
She sick to her area her she fixin' to move
In physical fitness her own business
Can I get a witness, this chick is a jewel
And she tired of the things that I’m sendin’ her through
She say when I’m gon see you
And don’t say whenever,
you
Know I won't leave you
But won't wait forever
and
Got my own paper
And don’t take your cheddar
And no I'm not finished
I won't take the check
And I say chill
you my winner from the door so
Step for set and dinner and a show
She say I be wearin' blue in the worst way
She say she get off work at a quarter to nine
So don’t be late stop ignoring the time
Unless you got something more important in mind
Like wildin' wit them whores I’m filin' for divorce
From the walk, to the bike, to the bus, to the cars
The flights
and the kites the lonely lonely nights
Ever since that party at the Rex
I locked down her heart in cardiac arrest
But the boy had it right
That you just ain’t ready
It's too early in your life
But whatever the weather that boy will have her ever
