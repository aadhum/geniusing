Imagine how it would be
To be at the top making cash money
Go and tour all around the world
Tell stories about all the young girls
Call up Sway, tell him to come round
Estelle in the house
Now we down under, 'bout to make it jump
Sydney’s prettiest fans in the front
Hip-hop show but act like it’s punk
1500s drop the beat at once
Exchange rate sucks make sure everything’s spent
Kick it with Ed Lover, flirt with Angie
Stop in Chicago just to kiss my momma
Now everybody hop back on the bus
Whole bunch of models chasing behind us
Take a break in Maui, rent out a villa
Then lean back up I’m a passport killa
Pop up in Japan like my name was Godzilla
With the whole swagger clean having ? taking pictures
