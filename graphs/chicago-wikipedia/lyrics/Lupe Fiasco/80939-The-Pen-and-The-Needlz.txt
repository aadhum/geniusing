Grew up in Chicago, West side, gang lifestyle, the drug scene, the whole.. it's like one whole universe of insanity
Pivot my fitted,
Then make you feel it like I mispronounced "filet"
On second thought, I can't make you fill it
Like you digging your own grave,
unless you can Kill Bill it
A night of the living passed away
Can you dig it?
Why Emcee? Hey
I do it for my village
The pennin' is John Lennon, the beat is the Beatles
Go together like Lenin and the people
I'm back at cha, and I Pac like cap backwards
Like a hat's backwards
you know, when the bats backwards
Yeah, like a bat catchers
The law gotta long arm like a back scratcher
But before I leave mine at home
Like a bad catcher, I think about my zone
Where pimps make scratch off the track like a DJ
Easy, that’s my zone rappers
It's my deck
Cuz it'll span ya where I roam rappers,
The word is mightier than the sword
It all became clear
Like a paramedic with an electric chest kit, YEAH
The gravity of the vocabulary is a caliber equal to Excalibur
Swung wit the grace of Agassi in his amateurs, THERE
There was a deeper depth, don't know how I got here
I also had a hole in my flow
It appears I sank to it...
The scriptin' of Scorsese the score is Count Basie
This is the end of the trilogy
, ya feelin’ me?
