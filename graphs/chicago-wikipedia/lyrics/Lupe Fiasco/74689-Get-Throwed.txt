My name, L-U-P that trill nigga
I’m a shark fin you a seal flipper
No liquor, no weed, no pills nigga
Still I feel I still iller
No codeine
Feel like a film, you a still picture
No movement, I’m a movie screen
On syrup, no sir, did it all sober like Gucci Mane
From showing off I do refrain
But in the v12 I do be staying
On the low yes I do remain
But I can pull up more autos like 2 T-Pains
2 Kanyes, 2 Lil Waynes,
5 good watches
3 good chainz
Please don’t think that it’s coochie mane
My heart running cold like choo choo trains
Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, they my kinfolk
All my friends fuck a fan from the intro
Been dope since the dog in the trench coat
Now you gotta try and keep them off of this flow
Like I just swept, and I just mopped
And it’s still wet, so you﻿ better not
I’m a macbook, I go anywhere
And you can’t go, you’re a desktop
So, I know exactly where to find y’all
You can find me too, all you gotta do
Is follow all the foot prints that I left in your Pine-Sol
Rolling in something foreign no leather, grippin
I handle my business, so I think I deserve to get throwed
Get throwed, throwed, throwed
Leanin' to the left, keep a deuce in my linen, man
All I do is ball like the ‘Stros off in Minute Maid
So I rock diamonds like the field, that's Minute Maid
Renegade, Em and Jay, real nigga anyway
Ben Franks on me, plus Jacks like Tito
I rap a lot like J and his son named Jas,
I make good music like Kanye jams
SS Chevy, sittin' on 4's
Iron Man chest, chain got my shit lit up
