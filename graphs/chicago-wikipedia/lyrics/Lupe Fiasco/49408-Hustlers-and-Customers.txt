Professional thugs, police raids, federal bugs
Who else is here, Belvidere, several jugs
Home made rocks, eye-drops, and medical drugs
A shell or two no respect for you edible slugs
You confess to a lesser two without even pressing you
Before the questions through, you leaking street names and addresses too
grab Glocks cocked under boxed springs
Most niggas want money and power
Half of them niggas is funny and cowards
Most niggas sleeping, like lights out hours
But I'm eating, trying to ice out hours
Take the flash off the Ford about to mash on you all
Lock your daughter door and cock your fourty-four
I got few friendships, cause friends tend to shift
Leave you to fend for yourself in the midst defenseless
In any instance that right hand can turn witness
Had to develop long vision like senseless
View the business of hard white
I sat too close so now I read with far sight
Get money hand over
Red dots like record
rob Peters to pay Pauls and extort Mikes
I don't pop Cris but to be Frank I was hurt when I heard they popped Chris
Y'all niggas is week, I'm leap year
L-U-P get it clear in each ear
Before you get it ear to ear and need mouth to mouth for wiling out
The basics: court cases and ignore faces
All you little jokers can keep your war faces
Niggas is easy to get
Weezy and Smiths
turn bracelets into
on the auto
Ready to cap from cop to Capo
Streets niggas get potholes
Pits get parvo
And I'mma keep your "City High," without two niggas and a broad
