Through the fire, smoke, and broken rubble
Walks the secret life, bullet-proof and bulging muscle
Death-defying, highest flying over trouble
Can you please come and help us out our hopeless struggles?
Sympathy is wearing off and dying out
In the face of all these enemies and crying out
Losing all this energy from finding out
The world is filled with ills, ever so close to timing out
Where, are those heroes?
Where, are those super-heroes?
Pondering, that super-villain's got a point
Looked up, said he hate the city now, even though
He swore that he'd protect it when he landed
Their perspective's now changed, all pretty much abandoned
The captain spray cologne around and said he understand it
It's getting hard to separate the saints from the satanic
Last remarks, they did it to themselves
I killed off heaven, now I live in hell
So complicit in their own non-survival
Told them that they biggest rival is inside you
I do possess the power to revive you
But if I did that, I'd just have to fight you
Cause you truly are the hero and the villain
The world stood froze, hearing a truth so chilling
Reporters stopped filming, somebody shouted, "Kill him!"
He looked back in disgust and flew up through the ceiling
Busted through the roof and kicked over the building
Before it hit the ground, a younger hero flew around
And put it on his shoulders, said you're naive now
But believe, you'll believe me when you're older
You ain't saving them from danger, you're keeping danger safe
In my hands, all the peace and all the glory
In my hands
In my hands
In my hands, all the peace and all the glory
In my hands
In my hands
