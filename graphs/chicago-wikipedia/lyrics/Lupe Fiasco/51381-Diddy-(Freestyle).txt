Oh boy!
It is him again
Lupe Fiasco
holla
You know
Im from them hard blocks
They want me to turn it off like jar tops
But I get it up, like alarm clocks
heroin rocks, the wrong drops
who waaant shots
Im on the court, most niggas is commentary
Dont play ya self like solitaire
I been through,
most niggas is honorary
I play the storm like halle berry
Put you in monastaries for that monetary NO!
Leave you cryin in pain
What I gotta scream for hold 9 iron while Im drivin a range
You talk like I fold or somethin
Like I dont flip birdie hold eagle that'll put a hole-in-one
I'll give you cadillacs, full of apple jacks
benjamins baby
I produce the cali like Battlecat
Get lost niggas
Be gone niggas
