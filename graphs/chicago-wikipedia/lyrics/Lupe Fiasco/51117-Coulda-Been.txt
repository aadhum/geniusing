Leeching, smoking weed to be cool
At DMVs holding lines up
Or wind up in line ups, my time's up
Could be thanking the academy
Been giving up, on top of building leaning forward, with no wings to soar it
I might be drunk from Moe stumblin' slow
I could've been marching with Martin
I might not even be conscious,
