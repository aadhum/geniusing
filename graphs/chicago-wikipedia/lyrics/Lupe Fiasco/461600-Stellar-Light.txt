We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light
In the new better, Lu ether, Lu effort like two extras
Four actors, no rappers, hundred takes for a hundred keeps
I went a hundred straight for a hundred weeks
That's too real from a projector
Set trippin' 'em black kid and put a light beam on that white screen
Black sport, take that boy pay, that's oy vey but I take that
I felt like I Superman with his cape trapped
Then Lu perform in no uniform in my human form
And still super to 'em so you safe at
Mi casa es su casa, throw a ball where your base at
In the worst case, they at first base cause I threw a ball where they face at
And they don't want seconds, I was so sick that I threw up all where they plates at
If the money small, then we money ball, and put us all where first place at
We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light
Did it for the streets, now I'm tryna do it for the museums
Good stated I ain't hood enough
Good cause the hood ain't good enough
Have smart kids all started on armpits
Then dearly depart from the part played
got the script started for part 6
We can have the world shining in stellar, stellar light
We can make our dreams brighter in stellar, stellar light
Crossing the sun together, we are the ones to make it
We can have the world shining in stellar, in stellar light
We spill a lil Mountain Dew for E. Till
On the mountain top that we built
Chiraq to the Brad Pitts
More schools, no war
