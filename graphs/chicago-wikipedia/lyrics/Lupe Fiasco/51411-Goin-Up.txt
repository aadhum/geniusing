For the past year had to get my lean on
Stay away from the streets I was glittering on
I was said to be short, but now I'm limosine long
I'm 5 years deep had deals galore
What they feelin now, I had to feel before
And what they feelin now I used to kill before
Told chill I wasn't ready, had to chill some more
Knew that I was hot but I wasn't cool enough
So I said I had to sit on the sill some more
I almost didn't make it man I braved it all
When niggas couldn't take it man I shake it off
Wore my hat where you couldn't break it off
Got a respect for the set, I would take it off
And walk down the same block from shit that you get chased off
And that's gangsta ya'll
I'm from West Madison
