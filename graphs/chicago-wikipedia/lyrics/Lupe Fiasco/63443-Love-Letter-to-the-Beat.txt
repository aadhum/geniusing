And leave it all behind like Gideon's
But then again
We ain't got to go to prison just to get it in
That bars for my windy city citizens
This is my love letter to you (paradise), you're the only way I can get away
You are (paradise)
My escape everyday
I leave my heart on the floor
Love letter to the beat
So move me my body's here for you to have
Thrill me cause this may be my only chance to be crazy
Black card kisses can't leave your house without that
