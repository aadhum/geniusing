Another day as I step out the door
Right past the poor in clothes they﻿ can't afford
For, this, I thank the Lord
Trip, and then you never snitch
You never tell a soul, not even a fish
Cause fish might fold, and run and tell the shrimp, ya dig?
And shrimp might run and tell the pigs
That you selling rides on the white horse right up out your crib
Bring﻿ the battering ram where you live
God, I really need a job, until I get it big, I be giving work to the kids
(Dope Boy, streets is calling you) x3
