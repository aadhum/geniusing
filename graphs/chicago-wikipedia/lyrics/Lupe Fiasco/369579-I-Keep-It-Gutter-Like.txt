Got the fishscale
Rubber grip pistol
Pop, like it’s Cristal
You can see me, low key in a Ford
No keys, the doors open like grocery stores
I’m the illest crime caught on tape since Caine and O-Dog
And I won’t talk, even if I’m caught red-handed
Like don’t walk, I flip it with no thoughts
You can talk until you blue in the face
The hood niggas call me Roger
Cause I’m flooded in carrots
You know I keep a chick topless, keep my whip topless
Keep my spit toxic
On the rocks like Whitney
