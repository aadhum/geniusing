[Intro]
...whole life for this, just to make it hot
(Ya'll never going to stop us)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(I've been doing this for a long time nigga)/
We worked our whole life for this, just to make it hot
(F I, A S, C O, listen...)
When you going to learn?
You're not breaking mine
Best change your mind like Frankenstein
From change to five to Franklin crime, I movement
I run with two chicks like I chamber nines
These playas praying that I gains a line
Or I slip into a gin popped frame of mind
Account's get low, and accounts get towed
Everything these niggas be about get flowed
These cats won't quit till a house gets sold
Cause if they get hit by them fourty-fours
They couldn't come back to life with soul to soul
Drop jewels like Ja Rule, no crying involved
Can only spit what I spit, with karaoke
Niggas mad at son of Madison
Three o' fifty fo' for real
