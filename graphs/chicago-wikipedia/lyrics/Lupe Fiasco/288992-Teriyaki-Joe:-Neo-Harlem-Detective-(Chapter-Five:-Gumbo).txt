Gumbo
The sky is a television screen.
The "sky" is the bottom of Central Park
The bottom of Neo-Harlem provides the same courteous service to Neo-Orleans which won its spot underneath us. We call it the basement

Underneath that in no particular order is Old London, Sau Paulo, what's left of Los Angeles & Moscow and that's pretty much it
City states stacked on top of each other like a shish kabob.
nothing is real.
"The Caste" with the ruthless & rich Central Park literally at the top and us unlucky bastards at the bottoms.
The rest of the planet is either fully automated manufacturing facilities or nothing. Central Park controls all modes of production.
religion,
The position of the real Sun over Central Park hasn't changed in about 100 years.
No history, no future. Just never-ending now.
an Eve to lead Adam to the Apple tree.
An Eve indeed!
