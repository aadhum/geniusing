Like a phoenix
From its ashes
We will rise
Follow angels
Into heavens
We will rise
Nothing's gonna take you down
We are everlasting now
We are everlasting now, now
Now I've been shaken
But I'm not broken
I won't be breaking
To take you out the darkness
Show you where the sun is
And those that have stopped singing
We can still hear you under it
