(Young Francis on the Drogas)
Five niggas, counted five niggas, all inside of that roller coaster
Loop-de-loop, over and over
Dope Francis, pullin' Drogas
Shaka Zulu in the tub, holdin' toasters, nigga what?
In the club, on the sofa, on the wall he got two chains
On her titties boy, that's a motorboat or
You can go with Noah or go overboard or
Life of Pi, so crazy
Silver Surfer, so wavy
Beat Army, go Navy
So cool, go baby
Gold and blue, so navy
Old school, I'm so 80's
Drop verses, top earnin'
Convert a bird and I'm so Shady
Keith Richards, I'm no Grady
I'm all tsunami, can't point break me
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
Lupeland, carnival
Barnum & Bailey pardon you
Replace car with barre, barnival
Lose control, bumper car or two
Lose control
Doin' battle with the bottles like a baller too
Like a carnivore at a bar-b-que
Art of war, arsenal
I'm level four and your armor two
Nigga that don't match, armadillo
Homeboy, residential mind state
Existential Rolex
Presidential, time waits
For no man that I've ever met
Treat a trash can like a treasure chest
Don't jump ship for a better deck
Or dump chips on a better bet
Don't change gangs for a less set
Full of fake niggas to get better checks
When it's real niggas that ain't never never left
Their good ghetto for a better mess
And my father told me just die well
So I'ma do my best to have a better death
And give a lot cause your deeds speak when you resurrect
But you don't never know so don't ever guess on letter X
(Lupeland, freak show, eyes all in that peep hole
You believe that you know that girl but I don't really think so
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I don't want no problems
I don't want no problems
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just playin', I'm gon' kill em'
Where your niggas?
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
I'm just chillin', I'm just chillin'
