Watch me Watts
That was red off whooping pull switches off trees
Pull of the leaves like she loves me...not
Move slow like Tai-Chi
I cop Jordans pull chickens with these
Please was not odd to work at pa-pa
Though I came with a biscuit
Just tryin' a make a mill
I brang in the bidness
Flow like chuch, pulpitted with ease
Like a fisherman
I'm pon my bank, deposit my thoughts
Till my mind draws a blank
And I withdraw from checking
I'll leave that with y'all for a second
Give you a minute to let it sink
For them dead presidents, I'll tie a bomb to your brakes
Period young blood, I return monthly
To bogart like humphrey
Welcome to the jungle like Fern Gully
Takes a village to raise a villain here
And you might have to raise his bail
Tryin' a free the whole cartel
I need to raise a million here
