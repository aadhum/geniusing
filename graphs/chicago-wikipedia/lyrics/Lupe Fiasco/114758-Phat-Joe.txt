First let me say, that I really like this track
I call it Phat Joe, this ain't no Fat Joe diss track
So, Lupe don't play like the disc scratch
The yakuzas took my thumbs
But now, I gots to get to runnin'
Cause the pigs is comin'
Like it's, troubles my way
Just a hustler's day, YOUNGIN'
Took it out the hood like Mr Drummonds
But they had to honor me like algebra trig
