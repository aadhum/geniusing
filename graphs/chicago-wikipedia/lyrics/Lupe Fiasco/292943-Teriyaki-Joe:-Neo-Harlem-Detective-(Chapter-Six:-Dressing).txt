---Have A Look Inside The Diner Mr. Teriyaki (It's Joe!!)

I look in through the diner window & see people shaking violently & collapsing.

I ask her did she eat anything in there. She says no somewhat startled at the scene taking place back in the diner. I rush in.

The waitresses are motionless, horrified. People grab at their own necks in chaos and last gasps before dropping to the floor lifeless.

Son of a bitch. 39 dead. Poisoned. Food Pills. Messy. Poor bastards. Talk about motivation. Shit.

A guy could really stick out in a city full of women.
