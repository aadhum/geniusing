This is well proven fact man
Faded jeans and El Rukn hats man
Gangsta scene failed moving pack yeah
But you can tell that I failed shootin' that man
I was peepin' through the cracks, yeah
Niggas tryna stab 'em in they back, runnin'
Game on the dames,
they stay strapped make you
Part of the war, this is...
life had a few hard knocks but I
Turned out okay, tryin' to write this in my own
Mind, yeah, but I'm no Jay,
then I started I grow, got hip, started
To know, same time learned gang signs, made rhymes
Started to flow, facial hair started to grow
Started a fro,
wanted
To dress fresh so I gotta walk for the dough
But the road that I took for dimes was full of bumps
Like books for the blinds
Wass...
