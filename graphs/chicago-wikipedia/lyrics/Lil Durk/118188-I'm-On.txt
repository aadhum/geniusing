I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that Im on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
I see an opp Ima take his life for him
roll the belt backwards throw the L's up
I be on the block, where they'll drill sum
My Lil niggas ready to kill sum
Don't let this rap shit come up and fool ya
I got my tools up and im a hitta
You run up on me and your are finished
I see a opp I take his life for him
We rob and kill that's that shit that Im on
Can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on (x2)
can't trust a soul that's why I keep that pipe on
Nigga run up on me then it's tragic
That drama leaves his ass in a casket
Gucci belt and Gucci bandana
That hamma got a banana
That choppa chop him down French Montana
O.T.F that's what im on
300 shit that's what im on
