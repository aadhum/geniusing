[Intro: Sample]
Taking it slow, feeding my flame
Shuffling the cards of your game
And just in time, in the right place
Suddenly I will play my ace
Flying high, flying high, flying high
I did two on my first case, next case 21, the worst case
I was 21 when I really sing the birthday
I know niggas die before they seen they 10th birthday
Told my niggas I'd be rich they called me liar
And now they buyin' fame but get burnt playing with this lighter
I come through late nights with this 40 and bright they night up
They grabbed NumbaNine for a homicide
Left me traumatized, now I'm screamin' fuck the other side
Rider, grab the glizzy, I'mma slide 'em
Fuck all these rumors, I keep my pride on [?]
Got a million when I bought a Ghost
In that European
They caught Max for the seven five
Left me traumatized, fuck the other side
Chiraq, Southside with Durk
Coke boy nigga till the dirt
