I'ma ride for my brothers
I'll die for them, that's on my mother
Only the streets can feel my struggle
One thing about 'em ain't no other
I raise hell in my city (And I know, I know, I know, I know)
I raise hell in my city, so be prepared in my city
Lost Nuski
Pat
to a bunch of these bitch niggas
Street nigga heart but the mind of a rich nigga
I don't know what's going on with half of these split niggas
One minute in the house next time wanna spit niggas
My city respect and honor me
a killer but break the bond and see
I'll decease for my niggas
Twenty one years in the streets with my niggas
Call bro, bring the pole, thirty six Oâ€™s, then you know not to park nigga
War time if it's animosity, and I got the squad to rock with me
Ride, I'm a rider
Beef with my squad then theres no survivors
Young niggas fourteen, no L's that be drivin'
Then catch a body on a nigga be lackin', we 'bout violence
Let alcohol trick you to a coffin
Think I'm sweet tell lil' bro to off 'em
Sip act nigga on the block with a Mac nigga
No money but we tax niggas
And these niggas, these bitches ain't loyal
And these streets, these streets ain't for you
