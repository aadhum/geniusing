I got cuban links, Santa Ria
In the hood no shirt, no fear
Aaron Hernandez with a verse, no plea deals
Gave your bitch a new purse, new V12
It is trickin' if you're worth more than Sprewell
Niggas snitches screenshot all your emails
Told them people now your hot
All your females, tracking devices on your car, all details
I'm in my Bentley in my fitted lotta jewelry on
[Hook: Lil Durk]
Tell me what's it gon' be, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so this ain't what you want
I'm on the road doing shows so well, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road you can't go I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get 'em done cause, this ain't what you want
Rick the Ruler, spent 150 on a bueller
LeBron James I ain't Trinidad nigga
Chi-Town niggas put you on a shirt
NY I'm the one my nigga
Coke Boys hottest in the whole east
[Hook: Lil Durk]
Tell me what's it gon' be, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so this ain't what you want
I'm on the road doing shows so well, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road you can't go I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get 'em done cause, this ain't what you want
[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
Niggas claim that they're after me, but this ain't what they want
Cause I hopped into this industry, this ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, this ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, this ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck Breaking News and ABC
I can't do no shows cause I terrify my city
They say I terrify my city
Niggas get slumped, you're the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, you're the first one to get changed
They say you snitch, tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me, ask is Lil Durk my name (L's)
You ain't gotta have asthma to get hit with the pump
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Try and snatch my chain, that's breaking news on NBC
Fuck a famous ho, I wake up, be on TMZ
I spent a quarter mill, on my new Rol', that GMT
I got Piguetâ€™s on the wrist, flex on your bitch
[Hook: Lil Durk]
Tell me what's it gon' be, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so this ain't what you want
I'm on the road doing shows so well, this ain't what you want
I'm on the road you can't go I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get 'em done cause, this ain't what you want
