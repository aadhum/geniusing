[Hook]
How can I not fuck with the niggas I grew up with
Hasta la vista, nah cause I'm coming back
I love to rap, I love the trap
Mama tripping but she know I'm strapped
The city want me dead, money on my head
On nuski i ain't scared
No cash so I had to steal nigga
Gotta keep my pole on me
My old homie told on me
[Hook]
I cried out with no reply
And I can't feel you by my side
Grew up in the ghetto the hard way
Pipes in the hallway
Me? I went the smart way
Started rapping for the large cake
House on the hill
Ain't worried bout a deal
Imma do it the hard way
[Hook]
