and they with the shits
My favorite shoes Prada
Due to the fact they comfortable
Tell 'em keep the rims
I wanna ride comfortable
She stress when she witchu
When she with me, she comfortable
I give two fucks about her
And judge her like Your Honor do
I'm 7-4-14
Shout out my 300 crew
With that AR-15
I just hit a lick, which Breitling am I gonna pick?
I just want some top, baby I don't really wanna hit
At the top it's just us
That's why we lookin' down and shit
MUBU, OTF, them pussy niggas panickin'
I'm Lil Durk, I'm 300, I keep a bankroll
We fuckin' hoes, we turned up, D-Thang we Bang Bros
We keep the K, find a bitch to save, yeah we like to say hoes
I fuck 'em, I can't trust 'em
That MAC I got be Russian
But my car from London
That mean my car got horses
My Polo say Ralph Lauren
I catch an opp, I'm scorin'
Kushy got my high
It got my molly boostin' too
I'm 2-4-14
Now shout out to my MUBU crew
L's up for my real niggas, L's up for my shooters too
RIP to King Lean, make them niggas do the woo
