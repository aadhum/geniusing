Pour a cup of that dirty
Might take me a perc 30
Gotta watch out for who lo
and the same people who hurt me
Gotta watch out for who love me and the same people who hurt me
My momma said I might OD
I'ma a drinker ma I ain't worried
Gotta watch out in these streets
I'ma a thinker ma I ain’t worried
Can't trust none of these niggas
Don't love none of these bitches
How they judging me nigga
I came up from these trenches
I might roll a blunt up for my people
I might pour a cup up for my people
Beat my case wit the best lawyer
Told my sister I want the best for ya
Fuck a strippa go invest money
IG hoes that's a test for ya
Devil workin' want the best of ya
Street niggas make a mess of ya
Lil niggas put stress on ya
Pour a cup of that dirty
Might take me a perc 30
Gotta watch out for who love me and the same people who hurt me
My momma said I might OD
I'ma a drinker ma I ain't worried
Gotta watch out in these streets
I'ma a thinker ma I ain’t worried
Can't trust none of these niggas
Don't love none of these bitches
How they judging me nigga
I came up from these trenches
I might roll a blunt up for my people
I might pour a cup up for my people
Pour a cup of that dirty
Might take me a perc 30
Gotta watch out for who love me and the same people who hurt me
My momma said I might OD
I'ma a drinker ma I ain't worried
Gotta watch out in these streets
I'ma a thinker ma I ain’t worried
Can't trust none of these niggas
Don't love none of these bitches
How they judging me nigga
I came up from these trenches
I might roll a blunt up for my people
I might pour a cup up for my people
