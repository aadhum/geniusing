Only a nigga say no is the hoes or the opps, on my pops
I was in the land with them mops
Pour a 4 in that Fanta
I'm a big ol' nigga 150 with that hammer
Glock for the tears and burnt candles
Coupe roof open like sandals
OTF we promote violence
Everywhere I go I hear sirens
Ain't fuckin' 'round with no fuck niggas
My momma told me don't fuck with them if they don't fuck witcha
Fonem love them drills but they doing hits outside Excursions
You broke boys hella broke boy you niggas ain't got a dollar
My partners love them bodies just bought them niggas some choppas
Yo' bitch say she on some but I ain't with the cuffin'
I treat her like a chopper that bitch gon' have to bus' it
Don't let that sneak diss nigga turn into a murda
My lil niggas wildin' with the mops they out here purgin'
Shots got through your window so you betta' close ya' curtains
And I be out here plottin' so the shit just gonna get worse
And bitch I'm a finesse-a
My squad out here finesse-in'
