For my kids, I'll shoot a nigga
You a 2015 killer
Album number two in the country
Yeah cause I canâ€™t depend on these niggas
They sell their soul for weed nigga
When I'm around don't speak nigga
You a leech nigga
was in town
Mama told me I was gifted
Don't sit on your ass and go get it
hard
Wack
FN Black
Can't name a nigga realer
