I can't trust myself, OTF
But this is what I rep, OTF. (That's GBE)
Niggas can't get right, so they get left. (So they get left)
It's nothing else but OTF. (That's GBE)
Only the family in my eyes, and that's OTF
And we is not a gang, we just here. (We just here)
GBE
L-L-Lets get it
Everyday I like to bake, I need cake
Cool niggas, cool with the jakes
The mac that I got a take his face
No shells, ima do 'em with the eight
Niggas sweet, on my life, I call 'em cake
Movie clips, I be shootin' like I'm Zae
Everywhere I go, they be knowin' my name
They be screamin' L's and screamin' bang
Everywhere I go, they be knowin' my name
They be screamin' L's and screamin' bang
Ima hitta, like Lil Durk, invented that
Mouth duck taped, I neva rat
Ima savage for that green, need cake
I'm on the block and my name hold weight
Where I'm from, late night, it ain't safe
Movie clips with uzi, one take
My life a movie, I be livin' what I say
Rat niggas them the ones behind the tape
Snitch niggas them the ones behind the jakes
On my wrist, it's an Audemar
OTF, bitch, we some stars
Foreign bitches say we got some awesome cars
