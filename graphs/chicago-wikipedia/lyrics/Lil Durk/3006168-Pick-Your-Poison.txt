I fell back off that love shit
It be so phony
I got locked up, they couldn’t send me a lawyer
My mama had told me
These niggas ain’t real, niggas be actin’ like homies
True to my religion,
we don’t believe in bibles
See one of my rivals, we don’t drive right by you
I used to chew on them xannies to get me through the times
I used to believe all them rumors, it took over my mind
