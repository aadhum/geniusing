And I keep them Normal killers
They come and kill you

Get poked for your figures
And then forget you
Wherever I go they go (they go)
Wherever I go they go (they go)
Wherever I go they go (they go)

Summertime pop out them killas
Hop out if we see them niggas
Tryna tell em I got my city
Wherever I go they go
Wherever I point they blow
That bitch wanna play that role
See the gang on the camera roll
Free bro,
free bands we got it
They took J-Money, he was savage
Nighttime by the lake with them cannons
I told them when I got on
They'll go every step I make
Remember I ain't have no gucci
Remember I ain't have no Louis
Remember I ain't have no groupies
All my niggas shooters
All my niggas ruthless
All my niggas wilding
All my niggas violent
And they kill for me
Lets get it
We smoking, we rolling
We on it, we toting
No phony broke niggas
They ride through right and wrong
For a price they get 'em gone
My niggas was in them trenches
Now all my niggas in Benz'
Still got niggas cuz I ain't get a sentence
They in the streets, I'm in the streets
Niggas acting street be killin me
Fuck yo niggas, I love my niggas
And they ride through whatever
Fuck yo niggas, I love my niggas
And they ride through whatever
