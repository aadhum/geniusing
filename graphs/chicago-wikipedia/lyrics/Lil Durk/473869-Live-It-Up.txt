A nigga like me don't give no fuck
All of my cars, all of my clothes, all of my hoes I got it
Everything could be gone like magic
I know alot of niggas die for that fabric
Eveytime I see you with a gun, is you gon' shoot?
Too many niggas be hatin, too many niggas be faking
But in these streets too many niggas won't make it
Got killers in M.I.A I'm talking straight Jamaicans
No soulja boy my shooters on deck,
Broke ass niggas I hate they ass
Straight 8 jeep
Lets get it!
No boxer wit this tommy
hill figure
He ain't even know it, but I know that he switched up
I know that he switched up, like juice did bishop
Hands full of choppers and Ak's
