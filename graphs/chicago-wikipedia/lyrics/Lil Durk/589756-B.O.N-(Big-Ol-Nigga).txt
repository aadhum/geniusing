King of Chicago man
This is not a diss..
Caught a new case and shit, made me look basic
Police want names, cause I done made it
Don't fuck with my niggas, they left a nigga hanging
Free Zoo and free DD
hardbodies don't say shit
Don't be from Mubu
this rap shit is fufu
(We don't rap beef, nigga!)
These niggas is snitching, we callin' em blues clues
I fuck with the Migos, but I am not Capo
(I'm sippin' on act!)
These niggas want war, knock meat out his taco
For that beef with our team
we shooting like porno
Shots out of Chiraq, born central city
Now I'm in LA, eating shrimp with Diddy
My daddy got booked with some books and a couple of millis
The next deal I sign is gonna be for a couple of millis
I don't rock Gucci, I just like Louis V
You stick to the smokes and the molly, I'mma do the lean
You so GDK,
With these Birdman I feel Rich Homie like Thug and them
(Like Rich Gang)
Shout out to Def Jam, No I.D. 'nem
on the scene, no I.D. him
(Took off his face with this 40!)
I call up D Thang, he dress a nigga up
Call up Randy Boy, po' lean in my cup
Fuck all that eating shit, I'm with this beef shit
I use a lot of autotune, but I'm with this street shit
(Ask all the opps!)
I bang like Chop, but I'm on my Keef shit
(I'm fuckin' with him right now!)
Take a nigga down, but we will not keep shit
Shout out to 300, they will not make a sound
If Kobe leave league, there ain't no Lakers now
Take me out of Chiraq, like Jordan off the Bulls
And these niggas throwing L's like these niggas loyal (These niggas ain't loyal at all!)
These niggas say they got your back but they ain't for you
Aye Nuski gang man RIP man
Free Rondonumbanine
Nuski got the strap December 15 nigga, gang
