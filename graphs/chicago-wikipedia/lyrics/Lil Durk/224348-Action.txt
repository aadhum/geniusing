All blacked up, ready to come and act up
300 easy for niggas to get wrapped up
Real life, my movie don’t come actors, (it don’t)
Grabbing the clip, my niggas screaming action
Name ringing, niggas be hating, that be the main reason
Glad I’m paid
got niggas plus my niggas be sneak dissing
Plotting on me, low key them niggas say how they going kill me
Real niggas recognize real, how you can't feel me?
O7', close range, no aim, they still miss me
Caught them slipping, clip buck 50, the feds listening
My own mama warned me bout you fuck niggas
Even she say that you look sneaky, can’t be trusted
Since my daddy cheated no Drake, we having trust issues
300 easy for niggas to get wrapped up
Real life, my movie don’t come with actors
I know how these haters talking, hoping I can’t keep a deal
2012 it set me back but o'thirteen this is my year
Till I see a couple m, that’s when a nigga write his will
Never tell, I get caught, I’ma spend my life in jail
