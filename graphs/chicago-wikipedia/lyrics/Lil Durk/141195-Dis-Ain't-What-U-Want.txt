Banged..
Tell me what's it gon' be, this ain't what you want
I call it how I see it, so this ain't what you want
I'm on the road doing shows so well, this ain't what you want
Cause the road you can't go I know, this ain't what you want
I hear them niggas after me, but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
I'm from the land where ain't no lackin' at, this ain't what you want
I wrap 'em up, we get it done cause, this ain't what you want
Niggas claim that they're after me, but this ain't what they want
Cause I hopped into this industry, this ain't what they want
See this rap shit ain't shit to me, this ain't what they want
I got the police all into me, this ain't what they want
In my own city they hate on me, put weight on me
Fuck TMZ, fuck Breaking News and ABC
I can't do no shows cause I terrify my city
They say I terrify my city
Niggas get slumped, you're the first to get blamed
A nigga try us, he the first one to get changed
They say "He snitch", tryna put dirt on my name
They ride on me ask is Lil Durk my name
(L's)
Daddy's doin' life, snitches doin' months
I'm screamin' free the real cause this ain't what you want
A nigga claim 300, add a K you done
I'm really in the field cause this is what I want
I'mma turn the streets up, this is the anthem
Niggas hate on my squad, I tell 'em step they shit up
Same since day one and I can't take change up
After all of the gossip, I'll still change sum'n
Fuck niggas don't want nothin'
They don't want it
Same niggas since day one
Nigga I'm 3Hunna (L's)
I hear them niggas after me, but this ain't what you want
And I guarantee this ain't what you want
(L's)
