That street shIt, I want it now I’m out here
I Just bought a chopper, gave it to Numbanine
I catch an opp on traffic Imma gun him down
Posted up on normal on the summer time
Now run up on me and get wacked, in other words get stretched
And if Durk is here he’s gonna catch
Headshot, fuck a vest that’ll traumatize him more
Shout out to them O-boys,
Free my nigga mikey, he got bumped for murder
Drama shit I finish a lot of shit, savage shit, poker face
I got these niggas mad, I’m around That drug money
I need it now, I got these niggas mad, I’m around(Lets get it)
