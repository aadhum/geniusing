Ain’t did shit to nobody, you feel me?
But I did shit for everybody
But that comes for fucking with these basic ass niggas
Everything happens for a reason
Before rap I had friends, got a deal, I ain’t got shit
Just tryna get rich, cause my people kinda struggled
Couple ten year niggas poor, but the hood still love me
Got my feet into the door, but this hood shit is ugly
I ain’t did shit to any, but I did shit for plenty
Two chains on, I’m getting it
‘Fore I hang with the fake I’m in the studio getting it
They stop a lot of shows, I ain’t did shit, I don’t get it
And my baby still eating, see em on the weekdays and the weekends
Tryna take me down cause I’m leading
Vision my story, no reading
Is you mad cause I make more, or is you mad what I drive
Is you mad cause I’m not poor, or you mad I’m alive
Nobody answer that, ask me one thing Imma answer back
Got a little money don’t act like that
But I don’t trust nobody
Signed to the street, nigga
Stay out my way if it ain’t your beef nigga
One fool play for keeps nigga
You don’t appreciate me, all the shit I did for the city and these peeps
Catch me, shit dead, and I keep it in between my seats
Pillow talking to who? The only thing I’m pillow talking is this gun in my sheets
Run up put one in your fitted
OTF 300
