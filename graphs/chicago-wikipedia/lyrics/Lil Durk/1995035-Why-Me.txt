Yeah, is it my jewels? (We Got London on da Track)
Yeah, is it my car?
Is it my bitches? Why Me? Why Me?
Somebody give me a good reason, you hear me?
I don't know
Why you got a name on your eye?
Cause he ain't supposed to be here (abortion)
Why you like to go through my phone no Porsches, cause the voices
Rollie on each side, yours ticking
Fake designer shit she got ain't fitting
