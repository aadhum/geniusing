Lost so many niggas, Oh my God
A lot of killin where I'm livin
Keepin' pistols, can't be victims
Put Vellanos on the whip
When I first seen a brick, Oh my god
Oh my God, Lord save me, Amen
Oh my God to who raised me, streets
The drugs the streets raised me
Cuz I wanted diamonds like Jay-Z
who I'm beefin
I grew up off of coke and D
Boyz N Da Hood
Can't drop my flag, I did to much to get it
