No, I don’t drink on no Qualitest
I sit back and look at the people you played
I gotta suck up the tears
Never depend on the slut
bucks
Shawty be lit with the Benjis
I lost guns in the rental
No, I don’t drink on no Qualitest
I said better look at the people you played
He were my nigga til
No, I don’t drink on no Qualitest
I said better look at the people you played
