Sayin' BDK then watch yo' mouth
Thirty shots go out [Rrraaa Rrraaa!]
Why you hate on me? I taught you niggas how to bag a treat
Keep my gun, on my son, my niggas they one of one
Nigga ain't no one on one, see them swing, I clutch that drum
Niggas in my face be like
"How you sign yo' deal and shit? Heard you left yo' block
When you made that million quick"
I ain't make a million, shit
J-money was torchin' opps
Beuller
'Cept our guns playin' all the music in this bitch
Opps be on that Twitter war
Stop, you ain't no hitta boy, stop, you ain't no killa boy
Chiraq, Drillinois
Autotune my raps now, every show, we strapped now
Two bangin cases on my momma, imma keep it on me
Gotta watch my back for these snakes, cause the streets hold 'em
I started this bar shit, feel me?
