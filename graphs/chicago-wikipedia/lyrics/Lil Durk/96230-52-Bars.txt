30 30's with 30's,30 niggas we dirty
I got my shooters they shooting, we show them niggas no mercy
From the pot to the block,from the block to the lot
I got to duck from the ops, they be too cool with the cops
See my life like a movie, I caught a case for the tooly
The judge given out ten I ain't scared I do it
So if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi
(if a nigga run up on me I react with the uzi)
Son needed his daddy I still need him right now
He doing life in the Feds need that appeal right now
I catch a body I'm gone, I'm dipping right out of town
Def Jam they signed me, complete my dream as a kid
64th
All that rating is dead I put a nine to his head
Lil rock snatched for attempt lawyer money I got him
If he can't hold weight he best believe I'm gonna spot'em
All black like I'm Bruce, so who think that was robbing
I'm a trapper to rapper
8 balls the size of baseballs in the field I'ma batter
A nigga tried to kill me dead, ops tried to wheel me in
Like the Cubs in '79 them niggas won't win again
Judge told me eye to eye PD riding on her end
Get caught with another slammer they say they first offer 10
I can't change up like a penny, I want head just like a penny
Russian roulette in the streets, life is all about luck
Pussy, money, weed, loyalty, trust is what a nigga lust
I'ma I'm packing like a Green Bay Packer
all white Challenger, saltine cracker
Free all of my niggas doing more than 3 calenders
Pigs snatched me up, smacked me up cause I ain't answer them
Can't snitch ain't a bone in my body say bitch
half them shooters ain't shooting they faking
my teacher always told me I ain't average
She said lil Durk he'll shoot I remind them of the Mavericks
