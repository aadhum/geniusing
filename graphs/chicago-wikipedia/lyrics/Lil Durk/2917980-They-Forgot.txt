We started this shit nigga, they know
Niggas cross me, they know
Talkin' I ain't did shit for 'em, they know
Pussy niggas, I cut 'em off, bitch
I just brought some MACs and shit, couple killers is after me
chopper that draco catchin' me lackin' me
Randy
Before I got this fame I kept a stick nigga
mink
Lam
Slide on that Banchee, on lil' Meek's ass
Niggas say Chicago ain't mine, them niggas  lyin'
Future got me poppin' a Perc, I took a few a slime
Free the guys doin' real time, 22 and 9
Bitch I'm me, I can't fuck for free
30K to see
Bitches sleep, got 'em mad at me
People hated me
Super sauce, I'm a super boss
And I got designer, Loubs and all
