I'm in Molly World, I need a molly girl
I'm in Molly World, I'm in Molly World
Bitch I'm out here bussin', I need a molly girl
Bitch I'm off the shits, I need a molly girl
Bitch I need a molly, I'm off one in the party
I just copped me a 'Rari, I'm global like safari
My chopper like a Harley, O.T.F. we in the party
Yeah bitch, I'm rolling
, all my bottles golden
Bitch I'm 'bout that life. off one ain't no sleep
Bitch you must be scared, off a whole, fuck a piece
Bitch I'm in the streets, fuck nigga don't want no beef
300 that's the team, 300 that's the team
Ohhh, I'm in Mary World
Smoke until I pass out, drink until I hurl
And my fans be front row, do you roll, do you roll?
Say that they're like us, but we are not the same
20 million later, still ain't nothing change
Poppin' up at the party, niggas poppin the molly
Riding out with young Durk, fuck around and get murked
Pyrex on my shirt
, Space Jams on my feet
Me without that chronic is incomplete
Say that they're like us, but we are not the same
20 million later, still ain't nothing change
Smoke it all 'til nothing left, T.G.O.D., O.T.F
Foreign car, my roof missing, white on white, I'm a fool with it
White on white, I'm a fool with it,
that spotlight I'mma fool with it
I'm out here like everyday, I get money in every way
Went to jail for my petty case, Molly World that's a better place
Cooking shit like Rachael Ray,
O.T.F.
'til the day I grave
Bitch I'm out here rolling, all these bitches going
Kush too strong, that potent, she wetter than the ocean
Molly got her in motion,
that lean is what I'm pouring
Molly, where we going? That molly where we going
