Niggas sellin' re-rock
I can hear the Federales tryna eavesdrop
A 100 bands in the sneak box
Lately I've been rollin' out in Cali with my nigga YG and he a treetop
On my way to link up at Chicago with my nigga Durk and get the 30 threeshot
My young niggas they so with it
Big bag they go get it
Young niggas a sweep your whole mother side with that K
Lawyer money on lawyer money, my young niggas okay
Extendos in my bape
Stars all on my roof
Hit the hood in that Wraith
Free 9
Pussy niggas better rewind
Back it up don't say it again
Niggas under Larry Hoover still love me yeah
'Cause you got a gun bitch you still scary
Ain't win yet, don't put me in that jam nigga
Ain't sayin' shit, my young niggas go ham nigga
K round stick, and we on whoever wherever anybody can get it, I'm with it yeah yeah
