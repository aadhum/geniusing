You've been rooting for a nigga for a minute
But to do this here exclusively
I lose you in a second
And your views are independent
but your friends gossip
See even if I kept my nose clean, they'd still claim it's snot up
But that liquor, bring the honesty out a nigga
Look at her in her eyes, can't trust her 'round my guys
Her friends they kinda hate me, cause I think I'm all that
