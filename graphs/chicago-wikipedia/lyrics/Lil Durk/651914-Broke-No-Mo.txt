My niggas told me that we good
And we ain't gon' be broke no mo
We live it up like its our last
Like we can't live it up no mo
I just wanna show these Old Timers
They ain't shit no mo
I'ma turn up on whoever
I cannot go broke no mo
Broke no mo, I can't go broke no mo
Broke no mo, I can't go broke no mo
I just wanna show these Old Timers
They ain't shit no mo
I cannot go broke no mo
I can trust myself, I'm OTF
So all that other shit you screamin', keep it over there
I just want a check and 'nem before I check myself
Niggas in my face for the fame, never change
These niggas gon' make me change
Not change but change, damn
Crack call, drug deal, just can't go broke
Tax season
MAC squeezin'
