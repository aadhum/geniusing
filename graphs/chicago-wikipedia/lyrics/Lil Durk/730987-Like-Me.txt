She don't know about real niggas, she don't know no boss
She don't know about foreign cars, she don't what that cost
She don't know about love, she don't know what that is
She don't know about riding round and spending it like this
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Now she wanna fuck
Fuck with a nigga like me, wanna fuck with a nigga like me
Hit the club with a nigga like me
Do drugs with a nigga like me
Fall in love with a nigga like me
And never love another nig, never love another nigga like me
(Meeee, meeee)
Have you ever met a Chi town nigga?
You ain't never meet a rapper
Heard he bought you a bag for a G
Why you fuckin' with them broke niggas?
Two bitches, Malcolm in the middle
Fly to Vegas, bet life
Legs in the air, call it jet life
Got you jacuzzi water on a hundred
Need a bad bitch, tryna be a bad girl
You know I'm tryna trouble up
Buy everything she wants two times, baby double up
You ain't never been in my town nigga
Shawty gave me head like a penny
Ain't really been in love in a minute
It won't hurt if no one know about me
I'm a Boss, Hugo
Rich nigga since birth, you know
You my bitch don't get mad, Cujo
Nigga like me
I'm that nigga, nigga
Shawty thinks she the shit, but she could be a little thicker
So why do they hate? I gotta get cake
These niggas so fake, so stay out my way
Ain't too many niggas like me
