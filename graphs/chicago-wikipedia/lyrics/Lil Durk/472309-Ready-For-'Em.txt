They hate all my niggas, they hate that I'm breathing
Shoutout to my squad, ya feel me? OTF Gang
I'm just tryna' to do what I spit in the booth
Shot clock but he ready every time to shoot
I gotta chill cause the police posted on the block
D-Thang say we hot but it's easy to flop
I call Rod ‘cause he easy with mop
smoke one for Pluto
And step on these pipes with my niggas, they killin' my pride
Bitches, they killin' my vibe
IG full of money but they askin' for rides
Remember them days I was starvin'
Empty stomach, no car, no money
These niggas be tweakin' that's why I got shooters on dummy
Let's get it!

You want bombaclad war? hm? hm?
You wanna ramp wit me?
(gunshots)
Come on me say!
Me shot 61 people for fun!
Who want test me?
Come on, come on!
Do you know who ya bombaclad ramp wit?
You don’t know me, I’m the original Jamaican dandatta!
You understand, Jamaican Rude Boy!
Got Broski on point like Kyrie
I dodged my momma told me get out Dodge, I can't sleep
I can't mob, cause I’m in too deep
It’s to the point where my nigga only came to me
Fuck a homie cause a homie don't think like Tony
Montana cause the chopper for shorty, ohh
Lost J-Money and Tay,shit happen
No Drake, but nigga we made it
Called Dede he ready, he slingin' impatient, got killers like Hatians
I land in Miami, call Dada, we go and take off to Lil Haiti
Pillowtalkin' to bitches, I see if she bad, but nigga she basic
I ain't hearin' 'bout niggas, and I ain't worried 'bout niggas
Street sweepers, hit the streets up, and I care ‘bout a nigga, let’s get it
