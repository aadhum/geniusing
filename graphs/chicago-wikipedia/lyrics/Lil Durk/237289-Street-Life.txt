System lost my daddy man that shit is scary
Life without parole so much weight to carry
Signed to the streets yea bitch I’m married
Raised raised by the streets man that shit is heavy
Feds took them down for that anti-reggie
One way out the hood either rich or erased
I’m living in the streets that taught me the game rap game
L's up for all my niggas
[?]
Living in the streets that’s why we tote them thangs
Life, loyalty, throw L’s that’s how we bang
Time of coming big is turn us into winners
No open jobs right back to the corner
Think the connect 100 but they informers
You can’t beat the set you gotta join
Trapping trapping turn to rapping and I made a living
Niggas killed my homie and I made them feel it
Signed to the streets, ain’t a fucking difference
