One thing bout my niggas man my niggas with it
Even with this money it won't make us different
Man down, to them niggas I'm a menace
Niggas fake, bitches fake and I can't trust em
chase
I don't fuck with a lot of niggas, before this deal, on my kids
I was robbing niggas
My homie thirsty, he the one that called get a with you
Don't really need no gloves, my palms ain't never sweaty
I've been want ta spaz but my bro ain't never let me
Don't get caught with this rappin, I make a call you vanish
No dj with this cannon, you know I keep this cannon
