[Intro 1: Big Durk]
This is Durk
Better known on the Southside of Chicago
And throughout the midwest as Lil Durk's father
As it started out I had a life sentence
For the stool pigeon who told on me
And I been doing that time for 22 years now
Alhamdulilah by the grace of Allah
I got that blessing and won that appeal
And now I'll be out in a few years
To be with my boy, to be with my sons
To be where I'm supposed to be in life
And do the things I'm supposed to do as a father
As always, for those who in the struggle
For those who in this system
For those who in the state's system
Keep ya head, keep fighting
Cowards, rats, don't never win over real dudes
So keep ya head up soldier
And we gone keep on letting thing continue to flow
And we'll get out an do what we supposed to do as men
And hold our own
And be the fathers we supposed to be
Be the men of the community we supposed to be
You know how we do it. L's!
J-Money
300 niggas too real
300 niggas too real (Yeah)
Pluto be t'ed off the Remy
Think he a Migo off the Remy
He still got the strap, niggas trippin'
Chino dead not to mention
Rest in piece to OD
600 beef with Baldie
[Bridge: Lori Perri & Lil Durk]
I'm out all night and ain't worried
Mama trippin' got a nigga nervous
Shoot a tec, you on a cruise where I come from
Get killed out the blue where I come from
The murder capital so ridiculous
