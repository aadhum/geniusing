I be off them drugs, dont I
I hang with the thugs, dont I
I be in the latex, dont I
I fuck the baddest hoes, dont I
I do 30k a show, dont I
So name one thing you dont like
I can name a couple things, yo type, yeahhh
I Remember that summer
Me and J Munna had no money
Only thing that we had
Was a dollar and a dream
Some lean and that burner
Take a nigga down
For that 1400
Spend it on guns
For all the opp niggas
And i miss all of my niggas
Spending nigga shit
Tweak with my niggas
Chino
Told me they exposed you
And i dont owe a nigga shit
ma let a nigga know how i roll
300,OTF is who im rolling with
Catch a opp nigga
Now the block is named after you
We dont lie on these
tracks
I'ma get money
You fucking with me
I'ma put that on jmunna nigga (Bow)
I be off them drugs, dont I
I hang with the thugs, dont I
I be in the latex, dont I
I fuck the baddest hoes, dont I
I do 30k a show, dont I
So name one thing you dont like
I can name a couple things, yo type, yeahhh
She wanna give me top and i dont mind
I got durk and Chop thats more tight
My gift is a gold mine
Wait, ive been wanting this my whole life
I dont trust these niggas
Dont fuck with these niggas
Better watch who you fucking with
Beating up Chop beat on some drummer shit
I drop bombs like a soldier bitch
I love drugs, love rolling shit
Lil Varney
Still the same hip motherfucker
I be off them drugs, dont I
I hang with the thugs, dont I
I be in the latex, dont I
I fuck the baddest hoes, dont I
I do 30k a show, dont I
So name one thing you dont like
I can name a couple things, yo type, yeahhh
