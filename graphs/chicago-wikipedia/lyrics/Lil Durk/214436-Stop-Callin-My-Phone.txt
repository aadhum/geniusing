Why they fucking tweakin', they calling my phone
These niggas tweakin' bitches tweakin', they calling my phone
See I ain't handing out no favors stop calling my phone
You ain't my bitch or my connect I ain't picking up the phone
Just leave me alone they steady calling, stop calling my phone
These niggas looking for some work but don't call up my phone
These bitches tweakin', they be tweakin' and calling my phone
Everybody they be tweakin', they calling my phone
I ain't tweakin' I'm seeing them tweet
Catch him in real life on folk them I'ma lead
I got that call about my bro, I didn't wanna believe it (J. Money)
I'm on a open case just a open case turned into a murder case, just in case it ain't safe lord pray for me
I wonder for all my dirt, will he open them gates for me
The streets ain't bringing no promises because I got faith in me
Don't call me woofin'
Only my bitch or my
My niggas ride for my niggas
my niggas ride for me and I know that
I just want it all
Like K.D. bitch I'mma ball
