Nigga counted me out, should've counted me in
Fuck up the count on the milli, fuck it we count it again
I'm going out with my 30, banging on you and your friend
My niggas they counted me in
When everybody counted me out

Chino [?] was there
Hit the street with that rally on me
Daddy had told me behave myself
young nigga
In the hood with that gun up on m
My mama and daddy had told me go get it
The niggas beside me told me go get it
I keep my distance from these rap niggas
