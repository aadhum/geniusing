Take a ride with me in my car, don’t take it wrong I’m a star
let’s take a ride off to Mars
Couple hate you baby, I made it
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
What you do to me, baby what you do to me
We can make magic,
Fuck my nigga right now, if you need me right now
I come to lay that pipe down, but I can’t fight you right now
Did you give me something baby, cause you got me going crazy
Chanel bag, Birkin bag, Louis too,
Gucci shoes
You feeling me I’m feeling you
The way you look at me, grab that Brazilian
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
What you do to me, baby what you do to me
Make a man for your Insta
Nigga want to fuck because of your Insta
Next day fucking your sister
Baby just listen, I want to be grateful
I love you and I hate you, through the bullshit I take you
What you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
Baby what you do to me, what you do to me
What you do to me, baby what you do to me
