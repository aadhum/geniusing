Bitch I'm rollin, yeah I'm geeking
My eyes red like a demon
Cause these drugs are for us
I'm like a kid, Toys R Us
Spend them bands on them drugs
Cause these drugs are for us
Off a flat I clap you up
Off the molly she turnin up
I'm off the shit I'm tweakin
Lean lean lean lean lean lean I need drugs
Fuck you want my blunt you never put on for the drugs
Bitch I am the plug
