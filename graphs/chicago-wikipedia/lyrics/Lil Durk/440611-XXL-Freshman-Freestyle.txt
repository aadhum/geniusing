Mama raised me DOLO, all I know is YOLO
I came from USPA to rockin' regular Polo
Hated schools stay strapped
I can't say I hate rap
Nights I had to play that
Just so I'd have somewhere to lay at
[?] car cut short
she sold it for some G money
Felon below [?]
[?] doin' good
[?] doin good
[?] sayin' since day one still up to no good
My daddy went down for the set we beef with now
You send shots we send em back
They say I'm startin' violence, say I'm promotin' violence
These real rap niggas rap real but they be lyin'
