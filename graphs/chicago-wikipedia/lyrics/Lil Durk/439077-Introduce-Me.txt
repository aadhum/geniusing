I first caught my case when I was 17
Free Rio, they trying to give him 17
Money, drugs got me introduced to everything
Got me signed to the streets with no wedding ring
I'm in that jam no singer
I caught a case and beat it, Ike and Tina
Never thought I'd make it out the 'hood
.40 .40 on my waist deep, no Meagan Good
What I explain ain't got to be understood
Money and my squad got me out the 'hood
Grew up off Link and low-income
I be sipping lean until my face is numb
I'm thumbing through a check until my fingers numb
Streets a motherfucker, can't trust a motherfucker
Niggas be super-bitches, can't spare a crumb for you
I'm going broke, just pull that plug on me
Life behind bars ain't the same no more
Niggas ain't your niggas, ain't the same no more
Change for $100 ain't no money no more
