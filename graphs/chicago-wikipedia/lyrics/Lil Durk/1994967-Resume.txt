I was deep in the field on this street shit
Late night I was starving ain't eat shit
Hanging with a lot of niggas that was counterfeit
I was too real tote a blue steel
Had a deal,
had a deagle
No deal, I was breaking packs
Had to feed and go kill, post till I had M's
Then I had to go chill with a couple racks
I'm a real man
Studio 24 like a Laker fan
Street shit, had to take it in
War time out late I ain't take it in
I had to make amends
See you the red light
Creep on you with the red light
Strip a forty, getcha head right
I'ma side slide
Ion't know nothing I was on the road doing shows so bye bye
Well connected like Wifi
Ion't know shit I can't tell on my guys
Smoking on this spinach game, Popeye
Light a nigga brain like emmit till
Do a drill, they for real, they'll kill
Going outside to these streets, yeah
This street shit ain't for everybody (no, no, no,no,no)
So I'm tell this shit to everybody (no, no, no,no,no)
So stay in yo lane (stay in yo lane)
You can't fit in with this crowd (nah)
Whats yo resume nigga? (what's your resume?)
You ain't no killer (you ain't no killer nigga)
I'm asking what's your resume nigga? (what's your resume nigga?)
I heard you ain't no killer (nah, nah, nah, nah)
Who with this street shit?
We was hugging them corners
Niggas snitching they informing
Back then I couldn't afford it
dry
