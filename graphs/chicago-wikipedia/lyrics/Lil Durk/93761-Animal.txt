We was broke and now we rich, got me feeling like I'm Mitch
I've been rapping all my life
Get my hitters out the jail
I spend money on the ground
So you know I got that work
I got my chopper in the trunk and I'mma damage you
I got my niggas in the cut, and they punish you
I got my shooters with the scope, and they aim at you
What I'm smoking is potent, I rub her like a Trojan
like Shady bitch I go in
Fake Forgiato, that shit I don't like
