I be tired of these niggas tryna ride the fuckin' wave
I done put some niggas on they feet around the way
I done put some millions in the trap around the way
I done did so much I make 'em feel some type of way
You see this drip, it's drippin' on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
I go to sleep with the hammer
Fuck watchin' the TV, I'm watchin' the camera
I'm paranoid higher than a hawk
Let me find out you been lyin' 'bout all the shit you say in your raps
I put the hood on the map
I put the hood on the map
My young nigga just caught a double
They tryna give him the chair
They tryna give him the chair
[Hook: Lil Durk & Future]
I be tired of these niggas tryna ride the fuckin' wave
I done put some niggas on they feet around the way
I done put some millions in the trap around the way
I done did so much I make 'em feel some type of way
You see this drip, it's drippin' on me
You see this clip, it's hangin' on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Block nigga, war time, keep a Glock wit 'em
Future Biggie, I'm Pac, nigga
Drop a bar in the pop, nigga
I love designer, no rap, nigga
Feds listen, they tap, nigga
No green just act, nigga
Never got shot, but I put that pole to work
Chopper got a kick back and I hope it's sure to work
Free 22, 38, the state had told 'em first
It's my city, hell yeah
And my killers playin' here
I be tired of these niggas tryna ride the fuckin' wave
I done put some niggas on they feet around the way
I done put some millions in the trap around the way
I done did so much I make 'em feel some type of way
You see this drip, it's drippin' on me
You see this clip, it's hangin' on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
Pour up the lean, they hated on me
