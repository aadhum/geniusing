Everything all white, everything all white
My car white too
Connect white too
My house white too
All white, I'm a fool
My wrist white too
My coupe white too
My wrist watch white
my bitch white too
My cocaine right
my coke white too
You can't get right, you can't get right
You get left too
I'm OTF (that's GBE), I'm with that too
My trap go nuts, I'm high like zoo
You send one shot, we send shots too
I'm so 3hunna, all my niggas are gunnas
I shoot like durk, I shoot like durk
I ainâ€™t talking about jumper
My money long, my money long
My kush too strong, my kush too strong
OTF 3hunna, all my niggas get money
Look at phantom grill, look at phantom grill
Stainless steel, stainless steel
So much wood, it look like a house on wheels
House on wheels, house on wheels, house full of pills
My house racist, my guns black
