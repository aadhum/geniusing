I be with the killas, I be by myself
I be getting money, I be by myself
I stay in designer, I be by myself
It ain't hard to find me, I be by myself
I be by myself (x12)
I be by myself
I be by myself
But I be with my niggas, I don't need no help
Tote it by myself, We don't need no help
Ratting and snitching is bad for yo health
Fucking around man that boy gon get left
Guns in the attic and pills on the shelf
Got 3hunna with me, O'block and who else?
I dove in like Phelps
Load up the chopper, I don't need no help
Pouring up lean and it's bad for my health
Smoking this loud and it's bad for my health
He ain't coming right then he gots to get left
He ain't coming right then he might just get left
First 48, watch he tell on himself
First 48, watch he tell on himself
My first fifty thou, spend that shit on myself
.
I be with the killas, I be by myself
I be getting money, I be by myself
I stay in designer, I be by myself
It ain't hard to find me, I be by myself
I be by myself (x12)
Gotta lay low cause these niggas is fufu
Playing both sides, acting like Brasco
Black Rick Owens, I stay in designer
Word on the block, Louie gon find us
I be with the killas, I be by myself
I be getting money, I be by myself
I stay in designer, I be by myself
It ain't hard to find me, I be by myself
I be by myself (x12)
