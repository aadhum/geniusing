I give 10k to my shooters, they shoot
I give 10k to my Lawyers, Get them cases removed
I spent 10k on my watch, Trinidad James my jewels
I spent 10k on my ring, red bottom my shoe
Hooker shit they gon' blow you down
Where I'm from we lay you down
Blue tips all on them AK rounds
I be Ray Charles when I'm in the zoo
You get killed if you mention
You'll get killed for attention
Free my hittaz that's hitting
Fuck a judge, Fuck the system
Fuck the feds, Fuck P.D
Fuck a friend, Fuck a opp
Fuck your bitch, Fuck a block
Fuck that money, that's marked
Say my name bring the city out
I'll make a call bring them hittas out
When I flex bring the billy's out, benzes and raris
Chiraq where it's real, where we shoot up the party
Make a name in the streets, make sure ain't nobody test us
And you get drilled when there's beef, and you get gon' if you mess up
