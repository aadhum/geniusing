And out her panties
Ain't gotta spike her with the molly

Light up a Bob Marley
Smokin' dead niggas
Bottom of my shoe the colour red nigga
Don't turn up
Let them drugs get to yo head nigga
One hunnid 3 times

Can't keep up with my fashion
Cuz your money too short
But, I can't feel my fac
I po'd a fourth up in that Crush
No razor blade but that lean I got better not be cut
Cuz he know I love my druuuuggggssss
I'm smokin' dope, smokin' dope, smokin' dope
I'm leanin' leanin' leanin' leanin' leanin'

Lean-man, who every time I hit em he meet me up
You don't drink so lemme pint up that deadly
That Patron hit me strong

Now you deserve you some Jimmy's
Now fuck for fame
You might go and get you some Fendi
Don't love me
Bitch you know you love you them pennies
Now my eyes closed
Smokin' on that hydro
Now I'm wide awoke
Molly got me grind mode
I can't move slow
Lean got me on Pluto
Imma dog like Cujo
