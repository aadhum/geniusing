"Durk...she neva seen no money man"
"You ain't neva seen no real money, baby"
All she want is a nigga with some money (she want that money man)
All she want is a nigga with some money (she love niggas with money)
Well you got the right one baby cuz I'm stacked (you got the right one baby)
And you think you seen some money, you ain't seen nothing (you ain't seen some real money baby)
Rollie on me like twenty thou
My car too, I'm Bentley'd down
Used to flex with a box Chevy and now I flex with a Bentley now
Good hoes, they love me
Them classy hoes, they love me too
Got bricks all in my garage
That trap house doin numbers too
With me, love out the question
Eatin over here, it's a movie
his re-up
First single went platinum,
that's a teaser
all these hoes they eaters
OTF in the building
