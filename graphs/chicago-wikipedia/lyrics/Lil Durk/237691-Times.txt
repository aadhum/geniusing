Real shit, shout out to my squad
This ain't for no fuck niggas, ya hear me?
Times ain't the same
I seen, real niggas change
I seen, solid niggas fold
I'm talking about, snitching on they main
I gotta, duck from this pressure
And be re-leased from this pain
But this, shit come with this fame (come with this fame)
(2x)
Everyday I wake up, I gotta take a breath
Gotta get right before a nigga try to leave me left
Momma need help, got a new baby
Nigga try to rob me, run up on me, nigga must be crazy
Shit ain't right, but I gotta get real
I hope folks come back from the pill
I'm just high off life
Can't trust a soul, so pussy nigga get up off
And I keep my pole, so pussy nigga get up off
Cause shit ain't the same, I can't trust a soul
Cause shit ain't the same, shit ain't the same
Niggas want me dead, I can't go
I'm from the real streets, and I call it the Lam
No thanksgiving, but I'mma go ham
Free my nigga Jam, get him out the jam
And I'm beefing with the opps, they'll get shot
And my niggas can't tell under pressure
For them saying they real, I can't feel em'
I'm just trynna eat and see millions
