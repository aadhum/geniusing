Ay, I'm back on that '07 shit, ya hear me
I think I'm the only nigga that can turn opps to fans, ya hear me
Free 9
Me and Nuski swagged up in grad school
Remember when the homicide grabbed you
Boogieman had trap like a drive thru
Booka told me D-rose lost his 9-1
Sneak dissin' what these goofy niggas dyin' from
This nigga 'pose to been my man but he was snitchin' on me
And everytime he came around I was grippin' on it
Like fuck yo life I won't think twice and I'll blink you homie
Weâ€™ll turn your IG to an obituary
DD in the jam and he ain't said nothin'
Can't name a fucking nigga that I ran from
Just made 60 thousand off a Samsung
Just put a couple bodies on my damn gun
And we carry draco's like they hand guns
Bitches want this glo', wanna be famous
I lost my niggas to this shit that's why I'm solo homie (gang)
I can hear Nuski calling
I can hear Yuyu calling (Chino)
I can hear LA calling
Yea I can hear Pluto calling
I can hear Irish calling
I can hear J Money calling
And I can hear O calling
Yea I can hear Mo calling
I got better fans I got better thoughts
That Timmy Turner won't none to my Timmy nigga
Tim-Tim kept a fifty in the city nigga
Now they want me dead on some fame shit (Bitch)
Or they want some peace but thats the same shit
And they call them people that's the same shit (Gang!)
