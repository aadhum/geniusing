The niggas don't know what the bottom feel like
I want sum day ones, I want a couple of niggas too, you know
Day ones dem the niggas I used to fuck, ya dig
Yeaaa
Shoutout to my brothas
I just lost my nigga this summer
First hundred thou', like look at this money
I tell 'em all the time, who seen it comin'
We really, really, really came from nothin' like
I told my boys we rich forever
I told my boys we rich forever
Even though I do rappin', man we rich together
I told my boys we rich forever
Now might blow a brick in onyx
My heart racin', I gotta take it so I'mma make for my niggas
You gotta crawl before you walk and have patience young nigga
I just lost my nigga this summer
First hundred thou', like look at this money
I tell 'em all the time, who seen it comin'
We really, really, really came from nothin' like
I told my boys we rich forever
I told my boys we rich forever
Even though I do rappin', man we rich together
I told my boys we rich forever
See Nuski, they took 'em from me, free Glocks for everybody
Hooded y'all on that corner, I die for this Arizona
Ain't got grammys but got grams
BM don't want me wit cus
I came from shit, I came from mud, nothin'
You ain't blood, but we mud brothas
I lost my niggas, I say fuck summer
I just lost my nigga this summer
First hundred thou', like look at this money
I tell 'em all the time, who seen it comin'
We really, really, really came from nothin' like
I told my boys we rich forever
I told my boys we rich forever
Even though I do rappin', man we rich together
I told my boys we rich forever
