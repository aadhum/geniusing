Got hitta niggas that a hit a nigga
We still hit cause we still them niggas
Under pressure from the media
See alot of these niggas threats but I ain't worried about nothing
I woke up in some new punani
Got that Cyrus and that Gwen Stefani
Put God first then we get that money
Broke my rear view, fuck who's behind me
They ain't pray to God
Where I'm from you catch a lick or catch a body
That white bitch brought me back like Tiger
I'm higher than an astronaut,
Life ain't no joke, nigga L's up for lil Mo, nigga
Life ain't no joke, nigga L's up for lil Mo, nigga
