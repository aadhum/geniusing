My pockets put a couple bands on my wrist
Niggas fuck with that lean shit, I really be off of that lean shit
I could say what I rap cuz niggas know I be with that street shit
Got all the purp sip all the syrup, got me movin slow as her
Lebron you could bring the heat
Lebron, you could bring the heat
chiraq
Off one, off two, 02, 03, young nigga straight doing out hits
everybody on the block thirsty, trying to hit licks
I gotta get paid for that bread I go hard like AIDS
