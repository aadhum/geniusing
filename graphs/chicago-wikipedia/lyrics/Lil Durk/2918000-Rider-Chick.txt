She my rider chick, she on the block with these savages
She on point like a guard but she ainâ€™t havin it
We don't go back and forth about private shit
And she be on my block with all the packs and shit
I got a street bitch
I teach her all I know, she a street bitch
She hidin' all my dough, she a street bitch
She gon' go when I say go, she a street bitch
Taught her how to be cheap, cause ain't nobody perfect
