These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
From the city where they gang bang
Where they'll kill you if your chain hang
Two letters, dedicate you like AK
AR, SK
And you got to hide your finesse game
Head shot, no need for a vest game
These niggas they bitch, they’ll snitch on you
How you think they feel, get rich on em
I lost a couple niggas to this shit
Chiraq, where the guns like Iraq
Where the little niggas cook Pyrex
Where they pull guns out, they’ll fight back
I ain’t gon keep it on the d-low
I'ma make sure my neck worth a kilo
I'ma make sure the TEC got a ten loaded
These niggas they act like they know me
Cut em off cause you niggas so phony
Get money, they’ll call you their brodee
Bitch ass nigga you don’t know me!
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
Murder rates so high cause of the body count
Every day news casts say a body found
Can’t trust niggas so I keep a chopper round
Play crazy, have a lil bro knock him down
On the block in that Cut when it’s black out
Y’all homies tell bro bring the MACs out
Setup hoes they’ll set you up
Gunshots that’ll bring them jakes out
Every new rapper they fake now
If you stand we'll call that a take down
Imma boss up on em, on some Meek shit
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
These niggas don’t know me, they act like they know me
