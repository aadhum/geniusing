Real niggas step up from frauds
Gotta put money before them broads
how
Never put a bitch before my younging
I been locked up for a year
Ain't got mailed or sent money
But I know the shit was coming
Cause this life all bout stunting
Ballin' like I'm Texan
My wrist cost me a mansion
Beat the Case like I'm Rocky
Bad bitch wanna top me
