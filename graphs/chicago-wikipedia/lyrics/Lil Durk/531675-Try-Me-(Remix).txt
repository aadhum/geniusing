[Hook 2X]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin with nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
Bullets to his face, police call for backup
And just because I rap
I still a whack some
Niggas need grammys, they straight actors
Free RondoNumbaNine he just caught a body
RIP to Nuski, my cousin called me
And since my car white they'll swear I'm racist
Even rappers know we ain't who to play with
I can't wife a eater, I just freak her
Pass her to my niggas like a blunt of reefer
And since I got my deal, I feel important
I live what I rap and just record it
They tried to give me 10 if I didn't have a lawyer
Niggas out here snitching, they're straight informers
Try Me! Try Me!
Bullets got his name on it like a ID
Sipping on the lean is like my IV
My crazy life, I feel like YG

[Verse 1]
Bitch I got the mac or the 40
Turn a bitch to some macaroni
Tell me how you want it I'm on it
I really mean it I'm just not recordin'
