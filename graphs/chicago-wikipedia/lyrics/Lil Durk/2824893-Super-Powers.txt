When I get dressed I got super powers
What's in my cup give me super powers
Niggas tell tales, and they super silent
The labels ain't believe me, had to prove myself
Dthang you know, nigga you was there
For the niggas I lost I'd take a bullet
OTF my empire nigga without a cookie
House in the hills like the Weeknd
So she can be my super woman
