Purple water, pour up that berry that's blue
rain
Diamond water Tity Boi 2 times, that's like 4 chains
Boss shit, I fucked yo' baby mama in Mulsanne
Fashion geek, fashion week, you should peep my shoe game
Hoes wanna fuck me 'cause the fame, Ay! Ay!
I think I wear more Yeezys than North West and Kim K
40 on me, if you reading this message you too late
The streets left me hangin' with some niggas I can eat with
Ridin' through with Chicago with some bulls on some street shit
A.B in the trap
Slide with me, crippin' with my homie free the guys nigga
2 shots from this henny I can feel it
Rob me pussy niggas what's the endin', like
I stunt, gotta open trunk to see the engine
I bust, get up close to me and see that .50
Like I must, get a 100 M's before I'm 50
Like Pine Crush, sip so much lean that I broke my kidneys
