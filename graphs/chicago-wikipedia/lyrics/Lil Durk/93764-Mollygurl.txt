I'm in molly world,
I need a Mollygurl
Pineapple swirl, keep me in molly world
I just copped me a 'Rari
I'm global like safari
Your bitch she need a molly
I chop her like a Harley, O.T.F. we are the party
Yeah bitch I'm rolling, all my bottles golden
Bitch I'm bout that life, off one ain't no sleep
Bitch you must be scared off a whole fucking piece
Bitch I'm in the streets, fuck nigga don't want no beef
300 that's the team, 300 that's the team
Mollygurl my supermodel, I don't need my Gucci goggles
Pop one and might rep a Viagra
T.R.U. Religion my true religion
Foreign car my roof missing,
white on white I'm a fool with it
White on white I’m a fool with it.
In that spotlight I’m a fool with it
Went to jail for my petty case, molly world that's a better place
L's up for my hater's face, I'm energized like Gatorade
Cooking shit like Rachel Ray
O.T.F. till I die in the grave
Bitch I'm out here rolling, all these bitches going
