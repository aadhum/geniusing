I done see my homies sell dope to an undercover
I done see you real niggas tell it all to undercover
These niggas suppose to be my niggas claiming that we brothers
more loyal than the niggas than last year
If loyalty was the key, these niggas won't last here (Won't last here)
And they lyin to em, Put my life on the line for 'em
Studio 24 every night i gotta grind for 'em (let's get it)
I done seen my homies sell dope to my homies momma
I done see my homies sell dope to an undercover
