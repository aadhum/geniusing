Damn to this day nigga still pray on my down fall
You can't deny good music or a real nigga
For real for real
I used to break in the crib
Now I got a safe in the crib
Chiraq crime rate build
So it ain't safe at the crib
Shootings and murders I seen
I ain't never say I did it
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done seen a lot of shit
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
As a kid growin' up
I done did a lot of shit
Three years of my life to them people
Police killing my people
Overseas cause I'm legal
I used to be poured up
Put him on a poster
Reward money for the killer
They ain't never found the killer
Don't nobody know nothin'
Free Nine, boy let 'em loose
I'm in traffic with the tool
Three cases, I'ma fool
Gave my life to a Jew
It's in the hand of a Jew
Daddy gave me the wisdom
Twenty-three years up in prison
