Money and Power, thats just part of ma niggas
Rest in peace to J-money
Only reason niggas out they gave advice to the feds
Dreads don't make you Haitian
Some believe in the devil, tha luminati' got levels
Niggas givin up they family for some cribs and some bezels
Niggas change under pressure, two gun cases can't tell'em
I seen alot of niggas, go on dat stand pointing fingers
Told ma mama I love her, and salute who don't believe us
Niggas claim we they brothers and they right here when we need em
But I went through the trauma and seen nobody but Jesus
Gunshots ring off them blockas
These niggas mad dey can't stop us
