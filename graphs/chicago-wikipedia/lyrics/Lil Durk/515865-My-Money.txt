Nigga I'll a tweak 'bout my money
Up at night, no sleep 'bout my money
Get your ass killed in a week 'bout my money
'm living that lifestyle, livin' that lifestyle
Can't drop a mention about the opposition,
forty flicker like a camera vision
Dead bodies pitching, picture nothing
Need cash fast , smoking dope gas mask,
since a kid with the cig with my bad ass
No .48, and I ain't tote none
Since Nuski passed I got to get shit, empty shit, thinking bro I got to get rich
slang caine like the Undertaker
Tell them that I made it
walk in the mall
You got no rings like Amar'e
Do you remember the days I was down, I couldn't afford it
Now I'm on, got the Bently coupe, and it came equipped with the Forgis
Nigga better have my money, grab the 'chete, chop him down like a forrest
Get your ass killed in a week 'bout my money
That money I need it right now, I need it right now
Pistol Pete, my nigga Dada
I had to shed a tear, I had to cry, I couldn't believe it when she got revived
The streets is a jungle he didn't survive
Guala, peso, euro make a movie call me Robert Dinero
Wrestler flexing Eddie Guerrero
go to the riches the streets is narrow
I run to the money dont need a tie
I'm watching my back like I am a owl,
30 round extension
Laugh at you niggas like Richard Pryor,
I leave you with stiches so where is Lilo?
All the dirt that I did, And the lord he still chose
Get your ass killed in a week 'bout my money
