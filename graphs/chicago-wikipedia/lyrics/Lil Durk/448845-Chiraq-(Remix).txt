Niggas say me and Sosa beefin' but we both eatin', but only one keep it
Told Law he take 15 years, every crime we did we gon Keep It Secret
Can't Tweet Teyana corporate nigga lookin, so what I’m on I gotta Keep It Secret
That face no Stevie no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
I'm the same nigga that my city asked about while you in the cut steady buying clout
Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like
4 wings at Harold’s with fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets, location on we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C I got the 30 on with my nigga, Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissing on me, tell them thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack, so easy to get the nigga shit snatched
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here!
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs, just like him
30 punch like Tyson
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
You can never say I, wife shit
I don't even like shit
I just pipe shit
One night shit
New York SlowBucks them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48
O-T-F we a empire
Mixing that lean I'm something like a chemist
I'm turning up, making boss moves, got music all on Pandora
Bitch this Chiraq, not the windy city
Where we catch you off and it get ugly
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride
For a homicide when it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
One-fifty I'm really with it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
I'm a young nigga I be gettin' money
Take your bitch from you
And these niggas don't get no respect
Matter fact I gotta keep it 150
For every nigga that's gon' come with me
I'm on Roc Block with a new semi and a blue Bentley it do 160
Smoke a lot a of weed
Like fuck kidneys, put a dutch in me
Got a 40 on me, I don't trust any
And if any nigga ever try to end me
I'ma die shooting prayin' God forgive me
Straight killers I can call so many
I don't love no bitches but my mom, my sister, and my gun and Nicki
I'm in Hollywood came from Kingston Food
Where I'm from we don't play no games
Ain't no April fools, you will make the news
Where I hang we don't say no names
If you talk to cops I stay away from you
Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness
Don't put yourself up in a situation
Puttin' my relations in your conversations
Know some young bulls from a while back
Tryna leave the game but they never made it
I
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
Pussy nigga you don't want war
I got old clips bitch I'm Baron Davis
