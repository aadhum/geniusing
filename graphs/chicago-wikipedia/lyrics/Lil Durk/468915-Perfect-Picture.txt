Iont think my shit don't sta-a-a-ank
I'm on top of my city
Whoever thought some shit like that?
Now I be driving foreign cars
That picture perfect shit like that
Now dis ain't what you want
Name an auto-tunin nigga
They say they snatch yo shit
I get yo shit right back
Picture perfect panorama Porsche
You a pussy, still on forces
Made a "M" by makin choices
That make me see these hata's
Truest colors
Alot of kids before 21
Alot of niggas snake you for your mon'
(Whoever thought?)
I never thought
I buy the shit I never bought
I'm on top of my city
Whoever thought some shit like that?
Now I be driving foreign cars
Public houses, public schools
Only eatin public food
Really me but picture you
You can't walk up in my shoes
Now sing this tune for whoever you lost
Lives
Ayy-ayy-ayy
Pray for em
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayyyy
Pray for em
Ayy-ayy-ayyy
(For em)
Ayy-ayy-ayy-ayy-ayyyy
Ain't nobody believe me
Call me phony, call me greedy
Niggas mad cuz they ain't eating
I had to grind for it
Nobody had time for it
I had to put my mind to it
