Smoke opps out a Vega, 20 a show and the these niggas can't take us
40 Ruger leave a nigga with face lifts
RIP Pluto me and him on a space ship
I just copped me a chopper, that Nina my fragrance
Fly in that Beamer with that steamer with k's
I got the axe and I throw up the Trey
Niggas be talking, got shooters like Ray
Slide in the morning do a drill, no Sway
These niggas be fake, gotta watch them
That Nina my problem solver
At the top but I gotta go harder
I like my lean a lil' darker
Bullet holes same size as Ms. Parker
Get back if you ain’t gettin’ no money
YSL got me straight stuntin
I’m strapped, you tweak, I’m uppin'
Cash out, make it back, it’s nothing
Red spots on his face, no blushing
These guns, they burning like Usher
My shooters gonna score at the buzzer
Niggas get clapped bout rap
War time, no twitter but a nigga get clout
Clout Boyz, beg for a diss to get clout
Do a hit with 4-6, catch a opp then we out
Ring cost 30, but the watch cost 50
Ask french, cause he got at the same place for like 50
Free 5, tryna give bro 5 thats 50
Then we slide wit the 50
free 9
Free Rio, gave him 23 like jordan
Twenty two shotz, plus one that's Jordan
3hunna OTF, that’s the movement
Put a drum in a nickel
Blowing that tech like a ref with a whistle
Bitch I'm the shit, I'm allergic to tissue
Aiki gon' blow, Rex toting on the low
Bought a lens for the scope, guns cocked for a roach
Pound and lean
Burning trees by da O, try to swim, and get soaked
