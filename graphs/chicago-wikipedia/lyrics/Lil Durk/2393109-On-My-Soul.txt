Who is durk to you?
Durk that's blood cousin his momma my auntie
My momma his auntie blood
Real shit man
So when you all say blood you all mean blood?
OTF this is family nigga
This shit ain’t war it’s blood
Go through so much, nobody know
Hand on my pipe can't trust a soul
Times ain't the same we getting old
These niggas fu they get exposed
Who said I sold my soul for gold and clothes and hoes
Feel my pain, how you feel my shoes, can't feel my name
Once I hit the top I ain't gone change that's on my soul
Once you know about waking up in the middle of the snow
Seeing the news watching people dead that you know
I lost niggas but family different
My niggas family so tell me what's different
I came in late selling packs, momma tripping
I'm feeding family so tell me who get it
I ain't go to school I was on that block
I needed education, I forgot
When shit was real, when niggas lacking
Just made our city murder capital
Niggas need oscars, they always acting
Niggas is bitches they always reacting
