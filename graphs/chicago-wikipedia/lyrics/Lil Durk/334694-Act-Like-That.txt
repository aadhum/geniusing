Remember I ain't have no money, remember I was a youngin'
Remember I told my momma that I was out here thuggin'
Just get kicks, you see
My daddy copped whip & I copped plead
And I can do what I want, take you on a shopping spree
So I picked up me a mic, $200 a night
Night by night, now that 10k got me right
I put it on my song, free my niggas lost alone
I'ma real nigga til we on
See the streets a never break me
But I'm going crazy, I been feeling down lately
Shoutout to the Chi cause that's who raised me
I was robbing Jordan's, I was a juvenile so I ain't care
See life wasn't important, I lost a couple niggas this year
Auntie got cancer, granny gotta bad back
But she carry the family, like ? don't know how to act
Niggas claimin' we guys, nigga we ain't no guys
Niggas leave you hanging, niggas snitch for lesser time
