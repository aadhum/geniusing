Body after body all I know is murder, I'm from the darkside
That's why I try hard to not get involved, and stay under God's lie
Nigga's playing games with this shit
Why I'm hopin brains will get hit
I will not Tom and Jerry with them
I should thank God I ain't kickin' in doors no more
Emptying poles no more
50's on the road doe hoe
It ain't nothing to blow your show
FGE poppin', that's corn
To the PPD, 309 pistol county where I'm from
If I want ya boys bands, I hit him up
It'll be 2k, that'll split him up
Call my nigga Real
I'mma get the back, you go get the front
Bandannas like Montana's over my face when I hit em up
Roll on em like Alabama
Once I up seven better give it up
Like a 6-4
Drop his top then put em in the trunk
Better get low
Fore the fifth blow
Blowin big dro
36 O's
Keep a big a pole
With extendos
Like a joystick
On Nintendos
Like I'm workin in the drive through
Give it to em right through the window
Chopper spray
Bodies drop
Niggas ride away
Where I'm from its the slums, nigga
Get theyself fucked up a lotta ways
I'm just saying what I got to say
Prolly not today
But every motherfucker got a day
With more ratchets than a toolbox
Your bitch, she gonna suck like a loser
In that 4-door with the 4-0
Hop out blowin' at they ass
She just prolly wanna meet Tony
But you know the rules
Gotta meet broski
Then broski and broski
Y'all can remember this, too
Blowin' powerpuff with these bitches nice
Sugar with the spice
See the green clear like a fuckin' Sprite
Tell bud he better be wiser before he get hit in his six pack
Right up the can, yeah, sip that
See that boy ridin' like a street sign?
I need iHome
In your ho's-tel, no room b
Still slidin', no room key
Your bitch suck like they boo-ing
Nigga's mad at me like oooo-weee
Young boy cool like the 3-Cs
Met a pretty girl with the 3-Bs
Spray in his house like fa-breeze
Mask on, nigga can't see me
I be in her mouth like false teeth
Then I'm in between like flossing
She shake it like tambourine
I pull up like a sleeve
Her pussy pink like that lean
She wanna search just like Bing
Fire in the church
There's liars in the church
Scratch the surface, find a diamond in the dirt
I will father like Mufasa 'til I'm lyin' in the hearse
lioners
I see clients in my merch
Ok, I'm breaded bitch
You know I'm breaded like mozzarella sticks
Godly, how is he heaven sent but so devilish?
The coldest flow, colder than any Eskimos ever been
I served for 8 years, I felt like the president
You'll get off tonight like you workin' second shift
airin' opps
It get's uglier than Carrot Top
Leave her pussy bloody like it's cherry popped
Six feet deep, three pair of socks
Put em in the ground, that's deep rooted
We don't twitter beef, bitch we shootin'
All kinda clips, come preview it
This clip in my ak got 50 in it, that's G-Unit
Got another clip with a hundred rounds
That got mo' in it, that's 3 Stooges
Plus 30 in my Dez Eagle
Turn em into red people
Whack em while their jewelry on
Nigga, icy dead people
Glock sing when the mops ring
Lay em down first like a box spring
Had to sauce on em like some hot wings
We be goin in like a swat team
