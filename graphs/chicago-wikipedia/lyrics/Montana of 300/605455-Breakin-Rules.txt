We them dudes bitches want to choose Jordan on our shoes
Flexin’ shit check my neck and wrist
swag drip from my jewels
Haters sick cuz that paper thick take off with your boo
Breakin’ rules sneakin’ wit the tool you know how we move
Bag his bitch now he mad as shit he ain’t gotta trip
I hit and quit she ain’t stackin’ chips he can have that bitch
I’m a pimp ho I’m ‘bout a grip so get on your shit
Or you can get cuz it’s plenty fish and this bait on my wrist
Know they say life is what you make it and we makin’ paper
Still we ball and stick to the script just like a narrator
I keep that MAC my broski got the shotty
Ain’t nothing leave up out this bitch and catch a body
hit the scene I be super clean these hoes break their necks
[?
I’m a king but not like Lebron I stay with the heat
Real niggas no actin’ even though we ‘bout action
Smooth criminal like Mike Jackson boy this shit is deeper than rappin’
Take no L’s give a fuck ‘bout 12 boy we aim for shit
Forty bang and this ain’t a game we don’t play that shit
Been gettin’ money since a youngin’ hustlin’ Rico, Ace, and Mitch
Take your bitch have her takin’ trips just to make you flip
We get [?] shawty tuck the tool you know what to do
real nigga no fugazy
’m just in the club wit my niggas takin’ pictures with stacks and I ain’t worried ‘bout nothing shawty
All my niggas brought straps
