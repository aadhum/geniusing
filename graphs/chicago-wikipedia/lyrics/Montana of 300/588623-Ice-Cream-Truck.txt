Three killers with me with ski masks in the van
We gon' pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Rolling down your block
'bout to pop like rubber bands
Have them bodies drop
Them kids never had a chance
When I pull up like the ice cream truck
Straight out the window like the ice cream truck
Heater on me like I'm cold
I just bought a K nigga I just bought a pump
I tell bronem get the dough like I heard somebody knock
And right after I pop 'em I swear I forget about 'em
Niggas claim the with the shits until I shoot the shit up out 'em yeah
Bitch I think I'm Nino mixed with Al Pacino
Stacking chips like Pringles
I ball like Ochocinco
My wrist look like sprinkles
Iron in my pants like I'm getting out the wrinkles
Cook a nigga like a steak and fix his niggas like a plate
Like a pepsi you get popped
Send your ass to heaven's gates
Got the police on your block
Decorate with yellow tape
(Go to church)
Okay fuckboy you softer than Nerf
I'm lurking all through your turf
When I pop at you I turn families blue
I'mma pop a nigga no smurf
These niggas clowns and Imma kill a clown so jokers don't post up
Been no joke, I don't smoke but Imma burn hard when I roll up
My mask on, my gloves on so I don't give a fuck who see me
That semi pop and start sending shots
I'll put you in a box like Houdini
Get smoked like loud packs when I pull up where your house at
Y'all bitch niggas, Y'all fugazi
My crew crazy we bounce back
