On a nigga like the emblem with the big B's
Me and Tony two players like a split screen
I put my shooters on yo ass like some skinny jeans
And they goin' show up, poled up, shootin' anything
Cause they know a nigga breaded like some chicken wings
like it's in the grease
Zoro when I cut it leave her with the big Z's
You niggas small ball
All my niggas ball hogs
Shooters whack you with that iron like a golf ball
Put a hole in a nigga with the sawed off
Say he want beef but you niggas all talk
But we can still shoot about it like a false call
Body on the stretcher why he gettin' hauled off
And have his niggas all lost yelling aww nah
All y'all dogs should have been toting though
Even though i'm at the top of the totem pole
Fill a hater up with shells like he layin' numb
Pockets healthy just like Gucci tryna keep it up
Give her dick she sport it good, like i'm payin' her
Fresh as hell, be on point like Deadshot
Shawty let me slide in like the Red Box
Got a man ha, I want neck, headlock
Takin' bitches think I'm Future look who Scottie Pippen
Like he seen a magic trick he wonder how I did it
You know I had to bag his bitch but ain't no body in it
If the snakes up in the grass Imma stomp the yard in some Timbs
These old bitches hit my line had to cut 'em off like a limb
Got new bitches on my line had to cut 'em all like a pimp
I be fresh, swag kill 'em I murder 'em no attempt
I pop up just like an ad and I'm loaded like movin' shit
If he try to do 'em dirty just like the water in Flint then
I be shootin after him just like knockout but I don't miss
Bitch I'm a dog on a go roll like I'm Todo
Got dogs fighting in a cage, no Michael Vick
Harry Potter with that stick on a snitch
Hardships, triple x shit and they gon' know not to run
[Verse 4: Montana of 300]
No Surrender No Retreat Bitch
FGE we gotta eat bitch
Bout to kill another beat bitch
I'm like here we go, I did my part for the squad, now we in it tho
If you ain't rockin' with the God what you livin' for?
sendin' dough
That's money gram to the fam, you ain't hear me tho
Yeah I was made to get the paper like a envelope
See I turned nothing in to something I was really broke
Had to come up the harder way ain't have a penny tho
I used to meet my clientele up in the liquor store
I sold more O's than a fucking box of Cheerios
Left all the bullshit behind Tom Thibodeau
Rap God in this bitch, like a embryo
And I like all my bitches bad like a billy goat
I put your hoe up on the wall like a centerfold
Deep stroke in that bitch, I ain't swimming though
It's fuck bitches get money like a gigolo
I'm ballin tatted bitch I'm bam bam bigelow
If they want drama tell 'em holla I be with it tho
That's off top, mask up, Rey Mysterio
Show up these niggas all talk Arsenio
Special beam on my cannon like I'm piccolo
Pull it out the pants cook a nigga like he in a stove
Shoot a nigga like he tryna drop a video
Six feet put him in like he Pigeon Toed
Punchlines hurt opponents like I'm Riddick Bowe
I'm lyrical I been this cold this shit is critical
Yeah Imma kill it how you want it nigga pick a flow
The illest quotes every line like I'm sniffin' coke
Rap God in this bitch nigga!
