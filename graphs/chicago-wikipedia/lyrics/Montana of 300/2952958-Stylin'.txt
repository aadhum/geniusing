She ride it like a stallion
I'm sick like a virus
She wanna give me knowledge like an old head
Girl, i'm gone rock it like i'm harden

So if you try, yeah
Everybody dies, yeah
She ride it like a stallion
Mj this is it

Tuck her like i'm Chris
Your bitch hitting on me yeah she fouling
Where you can't  see it like violet
Trying to run it up like a RB
Clip hold a lot like a RV
Shawty talkin bout she wanna stay the night
Need it in the morning like coffee
I rap and I ball

You say that you ball you just scrimmage
You do all that for an image
Ice cold yeah that's for ages
Gotta nigga feelin like I'm ageless
I be turning bitches like pages
She ride it like a stallion
Boy, I will take your queen like we was playing chess
Before we fucking she sucking

My pistol under my pillow I have the safest sex
Robin Jeans full of thousands
She can't take it throw the towel in
Her nigga hating like he Calvin

No cuffs but your bitch just got D'd up
She ride it like a stallion
