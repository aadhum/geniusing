I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
Mr 40 bang kicking niggas damn door
Up this bitch on everybody hit the damn floor
If you love your life you better let them bands go
They know I've got bodies they don't want no damn smoke
We strapped up in the club pistols on the dance floor
I remember back in the day when I was bagging up country
I ball out no Fetty Wap
Planet of the apes me and broskinem tote banana clips
And taking pictures with theyself snitchin' bro that's that backwards shit
I'm Maximus, Achilles and Spartacus mixed with Gannicus
Invested in myself just like vending machines
with shades
Shawty riding for me I lay back she ride it for me
And understand that I'm the man and hella bitches tryna fuck me
Even though I am a killer she still love me bride of Chucky
And if she's poetic justice well I guess that I am lucky
She's my numero uno I don't know what you bitches think
She like me and just like me she don't smoke and she don't drink
See shawty held me down when times was hard for a nigga
Rent me cars, crack me cards bring it all to a nigga
If it's a foul yo she gon' take the charge for her nigga
And if I pass the pistol she gon' spark for her nigga
Up that iron and start sprayin' like stars for her nigga
Bring me back another broad then menage with her nigga
One sucking my dick one sucking the balls on a nigga
They eat me like a shark and turn to Jaws on a nigga
Let me cum all on
their faces
Snapchat she make it clap I mean applause for a nigga yeah
Bitch I got bars like a prison
And I'm all about my commas like a pause in a sentence
So make sure it's 'bout money when you calling a nigga
I'm a dog on a mission, flow's so raw and efficient
I go hard I'm consistent ain't no fraudulent business
Even haters talkin' shit was all a part of my vision
I told bro get on your shit so we can all make a killing
Risk it all 'fore I let my family starve in the trenches
No brakes I'm so driven I could cause a collision
If I kill you on sight, then I'm offing the witness
But it's FGE for life I'm taking off with the realest SQUAD!
