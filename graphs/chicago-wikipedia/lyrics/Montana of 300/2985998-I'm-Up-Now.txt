Every time I was up they was around
Everytime I was down, nowhere to be found
Now I'm up now, and yeah they stuck now
In they old ways I'm getting money while they hands out
Every time I was up they was around
Everytime I was down, nowhere to be found
Now I'm up now, and yeah they stuck now
In they old ways I'm getting money while they hands out
Practiced this rapping while trapping till I got cold at it
They broke, they mad, and they hating because I'm dough stacking
I've kicked doors, I've sold weed, I've sold ratchets
To see a difference I had to shake all them old habits
They just want to ball with you with hopes you give they ass assists
Attracted by flashy shit
Always there when cash exist
As soon as you fall off they'll disappear on you like magic tricks
