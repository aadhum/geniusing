All these bitches on my dick they know it's real long
30 in that .40 shorty that clip real long
I got so much swagger I could share some
I'm headed for the top like a flare gun
Bitch montana got that money in a bear hug
And I'm just balling with my dog SWISH Airbud
Lil mama body nice I hope that head mean
red beam
So many on me, niggas think that I'm pimping
Fresh up out the motherfucking pin ho
goals
Selling drugs is my occupation
Got a house around my neck
And got a car sitting on my wrist
I'm so caked up I'm married to the money I got wedding bands
