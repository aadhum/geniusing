Broad days, everybody wanna shine out here
9 to 5, they don't get it, so they grind out here
Niggas dying, can't believe I'm still alive down here
Trynna climb, hoping I don't lose my mind down here
I grew up in the bricks, down here
Wic
My OG sold our microwave, to get a fix
Sunny days, it still seems to rain
And the devil's the one they blame down here
Lord
Grab the wheel, it's too hard to steer, down here
Trying hard to not shed a tear, down here
Everybody playing for keeps, down here
Jealousy, they always compete, down here
These stomach pains, ain't no hernia
