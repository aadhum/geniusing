Got all these bitches want dance on me
Keep the tooly keep some bands on me
Brand new Glock that bitch won’t jam on me
From the bottom of the bottom is where I came from
Fought fire with fire nigga I had a flamer
I turn my hell into heaven yup I done came up
Had to kick disloyal subjects up out of my kingdom
A couple thou’ forty cal on me
But boy I come like overalls you know the straps on me
I’m making banks uncle Phil up in Vivian
No injury but lots of ice on me
A bunch of haters wishing death on me
Don’t get a casket tryna flex on me
