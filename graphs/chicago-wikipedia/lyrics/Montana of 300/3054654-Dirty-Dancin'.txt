I got these bitches wet cause I'm wavy
They wanna go half on a baby
I can't fuck with you bitch you fugaze
I will drip on a bitch like I'm raining
I got guns like I'm up in the navy
Keep 1 on me like Tracy McGrady
Dirty dancin' bitch I'm Patrick Swayze
Lots of bananas in my hammers, I got fruity clips
It can't fit down your bitch throat, I got too much dick
Bout to ball on these hoes like I cut off my dreads nigga
I will crack like an egg nigga
Bad yellow chick let her ride me like pegs nigga
Fuck with me end up dead nigga
Put a cap to yo chest like you sayin the pledge nigga
Or wake up with this tray in your face with no time to say grace
This that breakfast in bed nigga
They say I was a menace like Dennis is
Came a long way from trappin and hittin licks
Makin moves so my family can benefit
Even the paralyzed say that they feelin this
No Bruce Jenner fool nigga you been a bitch
And your girl treat my dick like it's licorice
First she blow me and then I slide in bitch I been in that game like my name Sega Genesis
If you start with a gangster I'll finish it
Put an end to shit then I'll act innocent
I come through with the Glocks to put you in a box
I'm not UPS but I be sending shit
If I fly through your crib then I'm giving your whole family boxes like I was Saint Nicholas
Up this ratchet it savage like Randy I keep that bitch with me like her name Elizabeth
Niggas act where the osca
Gangsta imposta
Better stop lyin Mufasa
He don't know how I creep and I pop up
Or how I think I'm a three headed monsta
All my guns they got kick ain't no soccer
All my bullets gon sing like the opera
I come through with this choppa
When it go Bracca
It turn your brains into pasta
Green light on that bitch like an xbox
I pull up and hop out no rest stop
And then I throw bullets like Prescott
I keep a bandana like xPac
Bandanas and guns like I'm Rambo
I never run out of ammo
I got more soul than a dance floor
You get wet like Poseidon when I come through
Slide and your death will be so mythological
I got bodies so watch who you talking to
Those who play will get changed like an audible
I put all of you up in an article
So shawty go nuts she went crazy
She was cleaning my pipe tryna drain me
Money changing but I'm still the same me
