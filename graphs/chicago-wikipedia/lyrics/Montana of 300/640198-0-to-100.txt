I go 0 to 100 nigga real quick
All these weak rappers man I had to hit the kill switch
Bet I see them mills' with no deal that's the real lick
I am more than drill bitch, I am more than skill bitch
I only talk that real shit
I am more than ill, motherfuckers call me real sick
Niggas get the chills when I step out on the field bitch
I ain't never lackin' nigga not even a lil' bit
Gucci on my waist, nigga you know where the steel sit
Understand this rapper not a actor I ain't Will Smith
So if you judge me wrong it's RIP to Uncle Phil bitch
40 bus' yo ass like a mothafuckin' field trip
Smoke a nigga, turn him into Fire Marshall Bill quick
nyquil
Shoulda' cut a niggas throat with a blade give him gill slits
When that Holy Ghost drops I promise imma' rock the nation
Tell my haters I said fuck em' they can't stop the operation
Tell the ops I'm not a doctor, therefore I ain't got the patience [patients]
And the piece be on a nigga like
as-salamu alaykum
On they seven combination the darkest abomination
Every time a chopper spray shit take away from population
yeah, but hold that
Not a Christian, Muslim, Mason and never ridin' with Satan
A relationship with God is my number one obligation
Hope like Hell that I don't make it up until I drop that Chiraq
Now they wanna' dick ride, do that till' they climax
Old bitches poppin' up, nah we can't rewind that
Old homies poppin' up, we can't get that time back
Labels on my heels bout' a deal, I ain't buyin' that
Show me ten mill', then show me where I sign at
Nigga I know my worth I swear you niggas shoulda' stayed in school
I got em' hatin' more than Ice offa' Paid In Full
They took my nigga from us uh, right before Christmas
Damn, now my niece got a daddy on the wish list
And Santa can't bring him back, shit he can't even get gifts
So I'm goin' hard with this music shit till' I get rich
Sam's Club baby, niggas know we totin' big shit
AK47's and MAC-11's with big clips
When I cock it back it look like I'm drivin' a stick shift
Them choppa's chop a nigga to crop more niggas than Pic stitch
Bang, bang, put two in that [w]rapper just like a Twix bitch
