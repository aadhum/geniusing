FGE shit
Fire in the Church
And all that
May 20th
This why they call me the fuckin' rap god, man
Tony Mon-tana
I came with that bag like I'm Santa
Two straps on my hip like a Pamper
Try to check us, get popped like a Fanta
I will slide with that pole like a dancer
Come up outta that tent like a camper
Dressed up in all black like a panther
I creep and I crawl, no tarantula
Bandana my face in a flag
Choppa singin' the national anthem
I'm shootin' shit, Canon
The clip's in a shape like banana
He got nailed he wasn't watching his grammar
Bitch I think I'm Thor with the hammer
And yo' question, I stay with the answer
In the field, I will leave yo' ass lyin'
Oh, I could black both of your eyes
Leave your bitch ass lookin' like a panda
Hit, now she think she all that like Amanda
Yeah, you know I ball like Evander
And she call me daddy like I'm Danny Tanner
down south
I came and I made that bitch step like the gamma
Turned off her phone to make you think that her phone dead
She grabbed my Gucci belt buckle, I told her "Go ahead"
She ate my dick and nicknamed it Big Daddy Long Legs
She gave me dome so long, I called her ConeHead
You a send-off
You be taking orders, Good Burger nigga
Is you fat or skinny Buddy Sherman nigga
I discourage niggas, then dirt a nigga
Klay Thompson got the Stephen Curry with 'em
That's a warrior we got with a 30 with em
Get rappers' head like a turban, nigga
Make 'em feel the heat like a furnace
If I wave it at em like a current, nigga
Then he catchin' bullets, Michael Irvin, nigga
scene
Ain't no calories, I'll burn a nigga
Put yo' greasy ass in a fuckin' box
That's churches, nigga, I done murdered niggas
If I'm lyin', then God can come strike me down
When I come up they gon' invite me out
Stay online talkin' shit 'till i sign 'em out
Had to check 'em, I took 'em to Nike town
And these bitches, they wanna be wifey now
I just did nine shows, that's ninety thou(sand)
drippin
Somebody please come and wipe me down
I'm on the edge,
With a hoodie on like Trayvon
I'll shorten up your lifespan, I don't waste time to come take time
Black 40 singin', thats Akon
I'm a real shoota, fuck James Bond
No screenshot, my gun flash, all headshots, that's FaceTime
Back to the green, like Draymond
You a goofy, a Buford, a fuckin' lame
You wanna ride on my dick for some fuckin' fame
Get sent out from your block, that's a fuckin' shame
Even you know you not in my fuckin' lane
I pulled up on you niggas like Birdman
And you know not to play with my fuckin' name
I know God gon' be real disappointed in me
If I choose to come blow out ya fuckin' brains
Do yo' pussy ass like I did What's-His-Name
Take his ass out the fuckin' game
You a toy boy you ain't got Buzz
You ain't hard, nigga you a fake Woody
Cook his soft ass like some baked cookies
Zip his body up like a Bape hoodie
My lyrics dope, I got crack for the fiends
He thought he could see me, he imagining things
He ain't enough cash to come clash with the king
You gotta be sick, all you do is ride dicks
Someone go get this pussy some vaginal cream
They call me Jabos, got that strap in my jeans
I'm Abdul Jabbar, cause I'm after Kareem
I'll give him a 50 like he Zach Lavine
Boy, you just a actor that rap like Hakeem
Don't make me come down like the wrestler Sting
Take L's like a knight when I slide like a bishop
I'll checkmate your king then snatch up your queen
I'm bout to blow like they passed me the green
Just got a new gat, it's a mac with a beam
My gauge is Fantasia, whenever I sing
Every line, he's been prime like he Optimus
FGE who we rockin' with
Flow with an old soul like a moccasin
Go tell 'Ye that I'm killin Desiigner's shit
I just bear hugged a panda then bodied it
Man he fresh, I be on some Big Tymer shit
Fire in the Church, sorry for the wait
Had to put the panda in a pine box
