Got dough my broski nem
Bank rolls for my broski nem
I done hit the road
I done went to shows
Hit the same hoes wit my broski nem
Never snitch on my broski nem
I empty clips for my broski nem
All these niggas hate cause I'm the man
I got bands in my hands in my pants
It's FGE you wanna see you gotta pay 'em
And just to think I started off on 14 grams
I keep heat on me like I'm tryna get a tan
So niggas better stay in line just like some crayons
Boy don't think I'm playing I'll show you what I'm saying
I go Super Saiyan when I up, click clack and spray 'em
I done ran the streets with my broski nem
Hitting licks with my broski nem
Trick vicks
And Imma get rich with my broski nem
And everywhere we go we toast the squad
All I gotta do is get my broski nem the word
30 from that 40 bet you motherfuckers burn
Dirty boys for life we done put niggas in the dirt
Put niggas on them shirts  yeah
And I done stayed down my broski nem
Gave pounds to my broski nem
You get laid down when I spray rounds
Don't play 'round with my broski nem

Kicked doors with them, fucked hoes with them
Boy I had some niggas thought was broski but had ho in them
Police pulled me over with that sack over 500 grams
Even though they tried to give me ten they tell 'em broski nem
Don't know what they thought this was, can't tell on my plug
Fuck with me, yeah I wish you would, show your ass what's good
Came from the bottom, I did what it took, all you did was look
Now we on and that money's long, blowing stupid strong
Thotiana say she wanna roll, gotta do the bros, gang

Fuck you man huh
