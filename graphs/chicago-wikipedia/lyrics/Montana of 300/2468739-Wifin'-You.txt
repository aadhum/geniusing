I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
And whenever I'm hittin' it, I'm thinkin' 'bout spending my life with you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
You're sweeter than honey, and these other bitches ain't fly as you
Swag,
while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
You be my woman, my wife, I promise to love you for life
You got more juice than Sunny Delight
I'll be your plumber, give you pipe
See, she make me think I can sing, make me forget that I rap
She cook me breakfast on the stove, I slide my dick in from the back
I'm in love with this bitch
Sometimes I can't help it, I think to myself
Man, this pussy so good, I might cum in this bitch
Say yes or say no, the decision is yours
Was gettin' lots of bitches, now mission abort
I cut bitches off like umbilical cords
Now come ride this dick cause it's yours
The haters can't break us, girl let's stack this cake up
I make time for you just like my name was Jacob
I don't ever worry cause I think you worthy
Like, James left the game, and I hung up my jersey
It's DBC gang, yeah that's why I talk dirty
And every time we bangin', you bust like my .30
I cut off all my bitches, only thing on my mind is you
Swag, while I be pipin' you
Swag, I'm thinkin' 'bout wifin' you
I make lots of money, but I still make time for you
I used to have lots of hoes, shawty thought I was a pimp
she fell in love with my stroke, she ain't know that I could swim
Had to cut em' off, baby, amputation
Colder than winter, don't wanna lose her
She a winner, my favorite place is up in her
Then climb up on top like a wrestler, she down for the count
Hold her leg up whenever I pin her
