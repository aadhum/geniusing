I got them racks up in my jeans (Ballin’)
Yet I’m a ball until I fall
Stacking my money tall
I Cross ‘em and drive hard then slam dunk a bitch
A penetrating pass cuz I don’t cuff a bitch
Player of the year watch me kick up a gear
If you hear them bitches cheer then I must’ve just appeared
I do this for my team ho
I should get a ring ho
