Bitch, I'm still loaded with swag
Still see polo when I sag
I still got dough in the stash
Still keep that poll on my lap
Still gettin' that mufuckin' cash
That's why these mufuckas mad
Bitch, I'm still loaded with swag
Still see polo when I sag
I still got dough in the stash
Still keep that poll on my lap
I be fly till I die like
I just jumped out a plane, yeah
In Ralph Lauren and everythinâ€™
They mad and they show all the symptoms
time
Still see polo when I sag
Strapped up in the whip with my goons
Don't get your pic on the news
Just spent your rent on my shoes
I got polo on my draws
Run up, this poll'll go off
I get dough on the regular
Like my pockets, I'm breaded up
Dress swingin' like the predator
Two steps ahead of ya
My bitch bad as angelica
Bitch I've been poppin', no settin' up
She went down, I call her titanic
Blue on me like captain planet
That toolie on me no mechanic
Klay Thompson with heat no ceramic
If it ain't no polo, then I'm rockin' my logo
Pockets swoler than bolo
I walk into my closet
See more kicks than a dojo
Hit ya corner in slowmo
Then roll up like a yoyo
Shots Flicking no photo
Then back to that dough, though
