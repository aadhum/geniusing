Rap God lookin' like I'm black Jesus
FGE No Surrender No Retreat
(humming)
Album dropping January 17th!
Money got it cash and Visa
Never gonna wear it out no heat
Haters mad for whatever reason
[Gunshot] Pop his top watch him fall slowly
She serve me up down to do the whole team
Tatted on my face I'm a inkhead
Mixing Henny with Ros√© bitch I drink red
All around playa bitch, a pimp without the gators
Last one try me caught the vapors
Bringing static like I'm major
Let her know I'm in the city for the weekend
Hit the show do the most then we leavin'
Act up and my niggas get to tweakin' ay
Cut the roof off the coupe like the weekend ay
Bad hoes keep our music on repeat
Xannin' hard I done fell into a deep sleep
Off the Xans and I'm not sleepin'
What in the world was I thinkin'?
Big bank on you lil' bank ass niggas
I'm a shark all you fish tank ass niggas
I'm the one goin' dumb with
Them drums call me Ringo
Gold hangin' on my neck so she know I'm first place, MOB
Never go nowhere without no heat
Ay I hit the stage and get it bustin' like yo BM
Ay after the show she choose a playa like a GM
I like all my bitches thick, yeah deep dish
Shoutout Kanye, I been rippin' shit yeah Yeezy
don't fuck with cash money like
I'm Weezy
On the come up everyday like the horizon
Ellen
I used to sell reefer
Now I'm 7k a feature
He think his bitch is a keeper
That bitch went fast as a cheetah
Jacket open big ass forty bitch I'm Hell Boy
Versace on me bitch I think I'm Uncle Elroy
I get that dough I got that bag I'm like a bellboy
Caught two bodies thank God I ain't go to jail for it
Beef with me it's not smart
I will let them Glocks spark
You'll get wet up pussy nigga you are not hard
I swear these squares soft in the middle like some pop tarts
Big toaster light his top up like a cop car
Give his top ten, he got hits just like the pop charts
