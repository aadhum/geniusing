Swaggin' like Allen
Iverson on you
No lackin'
I pack it
My 40 like Kobe
Don't pass it just shoot
No Reebok to answer your question
Turning down deals so you know I ain't broke-ah
Better know-ah go get the door like a chauffeur
I shoot yo ass like K. Michelle
Boii you fake as hell
I been ballin' like Dave Chapelle
Check my paper trail
My fans know I give them bars send em' straight to jail
I make em' dwell
Back in the day I used to put weight on scales
I'm saucin
I do this often
Was trapping at my fathers house like Macaulay Culkin
I'm on my cake bitch call me frosting
Got green like Boston
More polo on me than Carlton
FGE ballin' I'm just Chris Paul-in
My team up it ain't no stallin'
Bitch my whole team go retarded
These bitches Spalding
They on our balls and-
Don't talk shit I don't do talkin'
40 on me get to sparkin'
Get wet like dolphins then get the coffin
I'll off em'
My aim is awesome
Every time I come across em'
These nigga fallin' they gotta chalk em
My flow sick, my shit be coughin'
Skipped past a grade like
Rafer Alston
So take precaution
Boii I'm a dog take your broad
Cracked her like a car quick
I turn her on she get wet like a water faucet
Sleepin
I stick my sword
She take this pipe till she exhausted
She wants some more dick
But gotta forfeit
Tray on me you know Tony in for none
My first step make a vet look like a bum
Don't play for Pheonix but I do this for my sons
Swaggin' like Allen
Iverson on you
No lackin'
I pack it
That ratchet is glued
My 40 like Kobe
Don't pass it just shoot
No Reebok to answer your question
I'm paid
I'm so real my flow ill
3 on me D-Wade
I got that bag bitch
I'm bout my cabbage
I'm a hitman for that cash bitch
Put beef in caskets
If there's snakes up in my yard Ima cut the grass quick
Sit back and reflect on my past bitch
I did some bad shit
I swear to God I used to blast shit
Let families sad shit
Do I regret it  not a tad bit
That boy was askin'
He wanted to see if I was savage or just be rappin'
I put his ass under the seat call him Sebastian
Don't make me put on that mask bitch
I'm on yo ass bitch
Don't know who you think I am
When I show up its catfish
I Scott Hall and Kevin Nash shit
Come out and balling like a fan bitch
Right after I blam shit
Back to them bands bitch
Every move I make, I make a check for me now
Make dough off my clothes or I'm sellin the loud
Off on tour doing shows I ain't never around
My old bitches wish I was nailing them now
Instagram model be checking me out
All them opps showing love and respect for me now
You better be God if you testing me now
Give death to these actors, Heath Ledger a clown
Spraying them up and wetting em' down
Fire in the case for a felony now
Praying to God with my head up to the clouds
Askin them to never stop blessing me now
But I'm still gonna blow like a Referee now
I go hard for my sons I ain't letting them down
Don't play for Pheonix but I do this for my sons
Swaggin' like Allen
Iverson on you
No lackin'
I pack it
My 40 like Kobe
Don't pass it just shoot
No Reebok to answer your question
I'm paid
I'm so real my flow ill
3 on me D-Wade
