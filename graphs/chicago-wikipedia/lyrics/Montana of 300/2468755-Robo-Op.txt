FGE shit man, you already know what time it is
Gonna air this bitch out
BRRRRRRRRRRRRRAA
Bitch I'm the terminator
I've been 300 so long that even the Persians hate us
All my features hella hot like they purchased the verse from Satan
When I come up I praise the lord like I live in the church's basement
Now you fixing to get killed like the person that's nursing Jason
Come get you, I'll find a way
On your ass, like no time to waste
Fuck 12
rare
Like NBA it's safe to say that I've been blessed with the mic
Bitch I'm so fly that I can tell yo ass what heaven looks like
Lil bitch I'm Barry Bonds mixed with Pharacon
Runnin' shit like a marathon
And I'm Megatron with this ak, and my autobots stay ready
I'm a nightmare, no Freddy, you don't really want smoke like Reggie
I will take life from you pussies like you was givin' birth
I'm a sex machine and bitches wanna do the robot
that shit weak like 7 Nikes
