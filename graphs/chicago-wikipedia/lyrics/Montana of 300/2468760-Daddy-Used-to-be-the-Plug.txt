Yo daddy use to be the plug
I stopped sellin' drugs, but I'm still shinin' like the sun
gums
sandwich bags filled up with doves
Was gettin' funds, didn't give a fuck bout havin' fun
Rather spend time with my son
Way before the buzz
Way before the fans
I was pullin' out the scale
I was addin' up them grams
I was duckin', dodgin' 12, on my way to get them bands
Yo daddy use to be the plug
Stop sellin' drugs, didn't wanna get took from our sons
I started off with half a zone
Worked up to pounds of loud, from here then it was on
I wasn't like these other guys who didn't think or use they minds
Got high on they own supply, then fall off and wonder why
I was wise, I strategized
Let your setbacks be a lesson, that's a blessin' in disguise
than
Yo daddy use to be the plug
