Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
Been in a couple jams, had to rearrange some plans
But it made me who I am (Yeah it made me who I am)
Yeah it made me who I am (Who I am, who I am)
Never asked for a hand
Didn't have too many friends
Tryna stay out that can
While I hustle for these bands
But it made me who I am (Who I am)
Yeah, it made me who I am
Yeah, straight from the ground like a push-up
No daddy watchin' mama struggle too
Me hittin' them streets, had to hustle too
Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
Been in a couple jams, had to rearrange some plans
Just a young nigga, straight outta section 8
Project buildin', livin' around hella snakes
Way before the rappin' I was poor nigga
I was who was sleepin' on the floor nigga
Done took way to many L's
Sat in counties with no bail
Doin' push-ups in my cell
Time passin' like a snail
Never told, I'll never tell
like Pharrell
Nina singin' like Adele
told em' hold on like a rail
I ain't never lead us wrong, like I don't know how to spell
I get paid for every thought, like a fuckin' wishin' well
This is Fire in The Church, coldest thing to drop since hail
Started off movin' grams, doin' it for my fam
