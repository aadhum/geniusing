See me
I put God first and he put me in this position
I made it up out the hood
See everything is expensive
I'm in my bag like magicians
I am, of no religion but my Louboutins are Christian
Money team, Mayweather shit
Wings up, bitch I'm Pegasus
Sauce everlastin'
These bitches feeling my fashion
I just bought a Mac 10
[?]
If its my money I'm so in love
