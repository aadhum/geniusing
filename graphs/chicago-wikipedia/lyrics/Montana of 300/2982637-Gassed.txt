Pop 'em like a tag put em in a bag
Let them trumpets blow I ain't talking jazz
You'll be with the fucking dead like you sodomize
Bet this pump gone em leave looking like he been hit by tomatoes
MOB!
Just know I'm ridin with my niggas till we cross the finish
Slide that clip in Nina let her blow your ass some kisses
Bow! Bow! That's my bitch nigga
And she ain't never hesitate to pop that pussy on bitch nigga
My side ho is thick, I keep 50 in the clip
Pull up on a nigga with the mask on like Link
8 ball corner pocket when I drop you that's it
Like he rocking balmain high nigga getting zipped
I ain't talking ounces, shotty bounce em then he getting flipped
I'm satch mode when I let that gat blow
'm like Kobe ill give you 60 for that Jazz load
That's 2 30s sticking out like a bitch with ass though
Fuck that bitch and kick her out
Get back to that cash flow
We gone' get the cream like a fucking rash
Hulk Hogan with the stash,
Take away his future leave him in the past
Pull my mac on you dummies you don't want to crash
We gone run it up yea, Forest Gump
Pockets got the mumps fatter than the clumps
All that talking tough that'll get you slumped
Hop out, up the pump squeeze it fill em up
Then ill pull off leaving shells
Oppose me, mission fail, boy you sick as hell
Niggas actors like Denzel till I give em hell
Change in em like a well now that nigga pale
Steering with my left while I shoot at you with my right hand
Kill everybody cold ill turn your block into Iceland
