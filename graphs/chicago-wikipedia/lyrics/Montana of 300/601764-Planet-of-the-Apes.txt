Straight out the jungle watch for Anacondas
Only so far you can see stay prepared for the drama
Know my squad gotta eat, so we do what we gotta
God strong and I’m conscious keep one eye on the watchers
In the valley of the shadow we keep that light upon us
Play no games with the Joker they’ll see dark nights it’ll be Gotham
we shootin’ like Contra
It’s gonna be shocking like Blanka
Chopping shit up like Baraka
Ain’t no need for the doctors just prayers or peace for the mamas
Then it’s back to the gwalla them dollars decimals and commas
Cuz I handle that business with no degree I’m a
Don’t judge book by its cover you turn that page we will pop up
All I know is go get it me and my niggas is shottas
Amputate ya ‘bout paper at pussy necks like we collars
Little nigga from the ninth floor, mom was on that white hard
Shorty keep that forty buddy lowkey like he fight Thor
Banana clips for all you monkeys curious just like George
I’m a gorilla fearin’ no nigga
I got the thirty so it’s more than twenty cent when I hit his ass wit the four nickel
money longer than bubble tape
I take me and my money and two pistols on a double date
No safety bullets glisten at your squad before yo huddle break
Exterminate I come and spray I terminate ain’t nothing safe
When I kick bo’s like I’m Billy Blanks it’ll wet a nigga like he in a lake
So you sell weight gettin’ plenty cake
I got hittas that a crack a head open for a little change like a piggy bank
And we don’t bluff this ain’t poker we got tear drops in our faces like derrick rose with the fold ups
