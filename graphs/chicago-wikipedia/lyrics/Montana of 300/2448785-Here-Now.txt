No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
No need to worry
Cause I'm here now
I speak the truth
I'm the one they wanna hear now
Yes, I'm the one
These rappers fear now
I'm here to save the game
Baby, gone n wipe ya tears now
My conscious told me
Come like this and bring that pain wit’cha
Keep faith in God and make sure that you keep that thang wit’cha
You got a purpose
Don't sit around like these lame niggas
Y'all ain't the same
Jus’ cuz y'all came from the same trenches
If they ain't fight in that fire
Stand in that rain wit’cha
Don't smoke or drink
But yo’ high is when you on stage, nigga
Remain humble
And blow up like a grenade hit’cha
And never change
No matter how hard the fame hit’cha
I liberate when I illustrate
On my tribulations
Long as I'm feeding my brain
It ain't no limitation
One of my niggas make it
And then I thanked him
Inside of niggas basements
So my sons ain't have to come see they daddy in prison visitations
Like he was he was King Tut
It's FGE, bitch, we take pictures wit our Wings Up
Watch me save that bitch with my hard drive
Cause she saved me from all my hard times
