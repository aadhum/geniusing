In the studio, eating Halls and shit. Still sick with this shit
These haters on my dick piss em off
Take a pic with his bitch flick him off
These rappers trying to steal my swag get the sauce
Sold they soul for a loan niggas lost
I was lit like a new torch,streets was my new sport
Belt buckle double g's like two forks
Was drug dealing freakin balling like I was Too $hort
Was serving niggas in the mall like a food court
Deuce 5 on me I was Derrick Rose in New York
Had to put some squares in a box like some Newport's
Was known for poking niggas for that paper like a thumbtack
It's free J Real until the day my nigga comeback
I catch you clowns running around get your face painted
I put the chrome to his dome cause I hate aiming
10K for a show, you better hurry before the price change up
Versace shoes on looking like the white ranger
And shawty wanna blow my whistle she be beggin me
You call her Stephanie?, I call her referee
Head down between my legs OOOUUU pedigree
KP
Like why you keep on sonning them I should get a vasectomy
On my legacy
Saucing they want the recipe
I'm flyer then a Frisbee got all the bitches fetching me
And your bitch like my song she know every word like a spelling bee
felony's
I'm on your heels like i'm Beverly
After U like the letter V
Might bag ya bitch
Go through walls like casper shit
Rap god to some I'm blasphemous
They can't stand me like Kapernick
Steve Nash assist
My wrist matches Michael Jackson's kicks
cactus's
They broke as hell but paying tithes
Reason there pastor is rich
Pole inside my jumpsuit look like I be running track and shit
This 30 be my magic stick
I shoot like I'm T Mack with it
glassin' shit
And I ain't even gotta meet her I can fuck your bitch
Balling like Krillin bet I cut like a destructo disc
The greatest pussy never seen a killer come so quick
Look out the window hanging longer then Rapunzel shit
It go BRAAAAAAATTT until my gun go click
I got killers like porn stars there gonna come for the bread
