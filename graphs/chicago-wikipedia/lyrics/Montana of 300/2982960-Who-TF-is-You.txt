And they can't wait to break your ass down like a weak stool
Niggas think they sharks but to my chopper they just seafood
I cut her like a deep wound
Steve Urkel I'm too strapped
And everybody with me got text like a group chat
Put that pussy in the freezer I'm about to do that
Have everybody who knew you
Talk about he was a cool cat
Gucci to my fucking shoes
Flyest nigga in the room
No this ain't no 21 or 22
Big ass .40 on me
No this not no fucking .22
Put a nigga on the news
Than I take off to the moon
Stephen Curry with that 30
Leave a opp without his (trues?)
Blow him down like the hottest suit
I update when somethings new
Bosses don't tell what they do
They just make them fucking moves
Everybody know I'm like abc's
On heat with a mask like I'm Kane
You can get smoked like Jane
I'm flexing on em, Luke Cage
