I feel like it's my, it's my uh, my responsibility to do that and to give you something good, you know. Whether they know it or not, you basically... you're a teacher. You got somebody's attention. And, you actually givin' them something. I'm finna give it to you. Every kind of way, you know, the good and the bad
Fire in my eyes, like when the stove blaze
I am the revenant, I done been through those cold days
Fighting demons, trying not to turn to my old ways
Like you lackin' traffic, I'm blasting ratchets, that's road rage
Ya'll using structures, you niggas ain't using logic
One shot in-between ya eyes, and you closing em like a closet
The afterlife isn't promised, only death, we can't dodge it
This life we live ain't forever, so make the most while you got it
Don't fry your brain with narcotics, see God is my only chronic
Your demons might bring you down, but he'll bring you up like hydraulics
Watch every nigga around you, all friends ain't friends
Don't be no fool, stay on your shit
All love ain't love, my son, all snakes don't hiss"
Check up on me, no follow-ups
Teachin' all of my follower's
Till' they nail me like Yashuwa
Real nigga's don't ever fold
The truth that was never told
Is they'll bribe you with cars and clothes
Shiny diamonds and gold
Performin' at hella shows
And after that, nailin' hoes
Was fuckin' paid, no gigolo
I swear I was so fresh that even Zest thought I invented soap
Lost lots of green like pigalo
I'm just thankful I'm still afloat
It don't make you real cuz there's diamonds inside your damn watch
And never left your hood, and you always reppin' your damn block
And It don't make you savage cuz you be totin' no damn Glocks
Or you stay in the field, like them lil nigga's off Sandlot
If you don't want your momma to see you up in no damn box
Just aim straight, for that ain't cool,
Ken
Now labels on my dick, with hopes they can get my John Hancock
Nobody famous reached out to me, or gave me no damn shot
Made it this far, and I did it without a deal,
Every man dies, but not every man lives
And I'm thankful for my banks, like I married aunt Viv'
