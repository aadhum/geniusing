Like if God had wrote the bible
This is straight from the mouth of the person who made these verses
I'm loading my gun while reading
48 Laws of Power
The rapper that taught you how to acknowledge the higher power
Not eating bullshit they feed us
Robert Thompson
I'm the son that he's proud of, that's linking you like a browser
They beat you therefore you cowards
I'm on a whole 'nother level, Vegeta gon' need a scouter
I am the hottest outchea
Don't need no label to vouch, yeah
I'm wilder than Rockwilder
That's high off the gun powder
Came from the dirt like a flower, fuck nigga don't ever doubt us
My regulators 'gon mount up
wet you up like a shower
The flyest killas you know like them
pilots
gwola
I'm cold as hell like I'm cool with Satan
I've been in my glo like a super saiyan
Forever hustling, might catch me in heaven selling spirits
If you saw my bitch, you swear there's an angel in heaven missing
Bars so hot you would think I sat in the devil's prison
They say Jesus coming, I'm starting to think he'll never visit
If you are listening, you are witnessing exorcism
The best description is: heaven sent him, he's blessed for rhythm
And still saluting pops because I never forget who fed me
Pain is what prepared me, struggle ain't never scared me
Beef with anybody, I love my nigga; you dead meat
And I don't mean to brag, but pardon me like the red sea
And I ain't grocery shopping but I'll be where the bread be
I got this rap shit on lock, that's why they dread me
And I can make the summer cold flow go diamonds cold
I get more money on the road, then the fucking toll
Like strippers catch me with that dough and the fucking pole
Sliding on them like debit
I'm trained to shoot like I'm Riddick
show you pussies what wet is
I studied you, did my research, learned how you work like a medic
edit
I'll shoot your ass like a movie, and then I roll like the credits
I put in work on my own, bitch my middle name calisthenics
selling it like a Bo
When worried 'bout getting poked, had nina under my coat
edit
Beat us killed and deprived us, and we gon' let 'em guide us?
The best disguise is a book, you know they demise us
rise
think
for
Wakes us up everyday but you still ain't opened your eyes up
Stupid folks ain't gon' get it, you stick would who tied the news for us
The same ones who tied the knot and put that rope up
Been telling lies to get the common people's hopes up
And everything that they printed, you chose to soak up
The jokes up, they ain't fear us until we woke up
My 40 on me plus God with me, I ain't alone
They play my songs and debate upon my greatest poems
Can't chill with fake men, I'd rather spend all of my days alone
I seen more snakes than Medusa
Therefore my face is stoned
And you know God is not the author of confusion
Do you really rock with God or were you bribed with an illusion?
Hoping at them pearly gates, he'll pick you up when he's choosing
And your chances isn't ruined by the sinning you've been doing
karma
instantly start
You need to be taught a lesson
See y'all was charged with possession
I mentally store artillery, every thought is a weapon
I'm perfect for Armageddon, curing the narcoleptic
I'm just giving my gift, so I rap my past with my present
I'm spitting bars with a message, not here to spar with you Reverend
I ain't going against God, cause I came across him with questions
hell
I don't wanna go if my loved ones ain't all in heaven
