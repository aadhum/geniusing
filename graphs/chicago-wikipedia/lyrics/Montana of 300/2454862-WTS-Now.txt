Man, ever since I made it big now
And I be dressing like I'm rich now
Got hella bitches on my dick now
They wanna get dick'd down
Was caught up in that street life
Hustling moving big loud
Used to rock white tees
I got versace on my skin now
Bitches on my dick
They want to blow me like the wind now
Knew I was gon' blow like a grenade, I pulled that pin out
So that's that greed within y'all
Man
Man, every time
I drop some music
These bitches get shot by cupid
Man as soon you start buzzing
Hoes crushing all of a sudden
Bunch of niggas showing love
With hopes they can fit in your budget
Out here acting like day ones
When they know that they really wasn't
But I'm out like a concussion
No question they ain't one hunnid'
