Chuck is dope and I'm known for the dough
That I roll for that cake that I slide out yo stove
And I rock, hard like a cinderblock
I'm the cool kid at school
And I'm up on like the wheels on my bike I pop up
See them wires you can't ride because I keep it lokced up
I think it's time to give them remedial classes like niggas with no figners it ain't easy to grasp it,
