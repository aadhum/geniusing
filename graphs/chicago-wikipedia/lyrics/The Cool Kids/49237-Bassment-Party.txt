They say if you ain't got no money take yo broke ass home
[Verse 1: Chuck Inglish]
I say if you got you two dollars, then come through to my party
But get bent before you come cause for that liquor I'll be charging
And take down these directions
It's right past that intersection
Make a right at the light
It's the first house on the left
And get it, got it, good
Ayy I'm chuck, this mikey rocks
we ride bikes
Herringbones
jordan 5's
Got every single color
When it's hotter then a oven
We the coolest kids we know
It's my party, so get up
If you don't you gettin' jumped
[Verse 2: Sir Michael Rocks]
One to the two
Three to the four
Chuckey and mike is at yo door
We don't knock, we straight on that
"When yo album drop?"
You could wait on that
Let me tell you a little about myself
Then I look to the left, she dipping her hips
And licking her lips
At me I guess
Then I look to the left, look to the right
Point to my chest she was like, "that's right"
Cause if you knew what I knew
You would prolly try to
Do whatever I do
Prolly move to chicago
