I'm callin' tellin' y'all how I did it like Derrick Rose
It's no sweat.
The Damon Stoudemire blazer jersey is a problem
[Hook - Mikey & Chuck]
Kick it in the city when we in around town
Next door neighbors telling us that it's too loud
Now, neighbor, can you please just turn that mess down?
This is the sound of throwing pennies on the ground
and a focus full uh thunda. (Pause)
Duh brown dat be unda, man, dey know me as duh king
Faka' as I'm makin' maja' magic like I'm Irwin
Johnson and Johnson baby powder fresh
and my chain is finga roll.
Tamiflu
