I got six cellphones and still ain't pickin' up for stranger's man
Don't walk up on Chuck, disrespecting his home town
He flip on that Detroit switchin', hear it in his voice
I'm Chicago, Illinois, even if I done had a choice
I woulda' still picked the crib that I grew up in
You still on Ian Connor's page tryna' pick what to wear, yeah
Rock band tees and bands they don't know nothin' 'bout
You heard of Iron Maiden once? Bro that don't even count
When Them Doves Cry
I don't fuck with Hulk Hogan
It's the Bape head band rocker
Acting like some boppers tryna' top us
Nigga stop it
Get chalk lined in them Starters
I ride around with black mags
Niggas tryna' sound like Maxo but they Karo my shit
16 Bred 11's with that thing on my hip
