We spin blunts like we slow dancin' with them
The only place I can put you is my home
If you down please give me your phone number
My momma said "get money in the summer" and shit
I need that all year money
That private affair money
That "excuse me you ain't got to count it, it's all there" money
Cause all these pinhead niggas is tryna pop our balloon
But I ain't trippin'
Schwinn three-wheelin' down a sidewalk
We do it with palm trees neon green, it's folded
At the store where the peach teas be the coldest
K. P. and Envyi
Shorty swing my way
