Yo yo this is Mickey Rocks
This is Chuck Inglish
Shout out to the basement
Shout out to Smash Brothers
You are listening to cool ass ninjas
Welcome to Chi Town Zoo
Animal Planet probably channel 102
Imma show you how to survive and what not to do
Cause you ain't watchin the animals they watchin you
Gorillas and Baboons posted on the block
With hats cocked waitin for something to jump off
And the rats keep rattan and the lions keep lying
The bears bear arms they'll shoot you dog *ROOF*
And the cougars got rugers
Swans with bombs; beehives full of knives
So what Im sayin is, run for your lives
Steve Irwin got hurt
When a gang of birds murked him
Cause this is urgent, no longer the days of man
And the bats wanna hang us
Upside down from our legs
Watch that blood rush to your head
Down the street I saw a monkey in a suit and
I had to get a grip, was crabs up on the strip
I ain't talkin bout the crips, imagine little bit
