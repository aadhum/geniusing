Yo, now if my posse on Broadway
Lookin at the gas tank. Then I see the gas light
Stop at the station. He like "Ay yo why ya pants tight?"
Put 10 in the tank. Had to save the other 5
So I could get a Coca-Cola and some cheese fries (mmm)
I say "can you please." He say "pass me the phone."
I'm under 21 and sippin on a 40
I realize that the gas on the bottom line
And I spent my last 5 on the cheese fries
