Im hot as popcorn steam in the bag when it pops
Mailbox on your porch deliver mail to your spot
Door bells door knocks open up its the cops
Now I’m cleaner than detergent
4 by 4 GMC Jeeps Fords Broncos and the
Trunk calf lift drop call me chuck many-truck
Deep dish fat boys stick out like a thumb
In that mustang Cain drove bumping computer love
If it rains let it pour, what you think they made umbrellas for
Forrest Gump running to a bubba shrimp luncheon
To jump off the cliff from the beginning like the lemmings
Late night Peter Jennings here reporting live from the barbecue
And it looks like they're escorting guys to the back
Two black males wearing sporting cap
Just got word it’s the cool kids
