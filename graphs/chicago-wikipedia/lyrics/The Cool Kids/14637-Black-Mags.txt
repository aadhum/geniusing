I got this '89-'90, Pistons champ flat
Bill black Starter cap wit the hologram tags
White Mag rims
red rubber tires
Chain, frame, pegs, grips shipped from my supplier
Dopeman attire
gimme 'bout an hour
And I'll have it clickin, tickin, glidin, flyin like McGuyver
I'm a Murder Club dope pedal rider
Nigel said I'm good to get that ink on my bicep
I gets busy as a bee on my bike grips
If I cat-walk this
sidewalk, I could fly this
That it all coincides with these wheels that I'm ridin
Three point Mags make you think that I'm glidin
..
Shit, nigga I ain't lyin'
I got a long rap sheet that'll say that I'm tied in
"I'm on the Dyno wit the black mag, black mag" (word?)
"Dyno wit the black mag, black mag, black mag, Dyno wit the.." (word?)
I hit Chuck on the pager, "Yo, I'm kinda bored
Ain't got class til later so, open garage"
And I don't really know which way to go,
I ain't trying skate it though
so they send for the law
Joe
Ride past shorty light-skinned with no melanin
Shirt look like somebody stuffed two melons in
Had to stop, so I could preach like Reverend
I grip on the handbrake and say, "Waddup?"
I skip on the handshakes, I'm straight, what else?
I got two pegs on the back
And you got two legs under your skirt - so hop
Dope Pedal Headquarters
Chuck got the red wheels and the white mags, but it's all good
Got the gold hunnid spokes like "Boyz N the Hood,"
With the lime green frame (uh), dollars on the bike seat
Handlebar grips is the same as my Nikes
And the mode of gold I use for my spokes
And the frame is the same as I use for my chain
out
