Bally loafers
Cartiers
I do my thing Penny Hardaway
And if you're knowing where we’re going
Then you'll probably be coming with us!
Friday night nice, Saturday sharp
Edge upon the hairline, side tapered and ball
Sunday winning in the linen shorts sent from the mall
Pieces out the dry cleaning stitched seams and all
That glitters ain't gold but this is
Mars spike editions at the
palace like the Pistons
Peep the way I flipped it
The color on this one is like them other ones
But these colors complement it
wrap bills in jeans fabrics
Tennis bracelets
Andre Agassi
Cartier frames and Ballys
I tilt my woods up, slide them up the bridge of my nose
Them Guccis cool, but they are not originals
Shaw's Crab House
Everybody got a lobster on their plate
I’m not Kevin Costner
I'm not dancing with no wolves
Acting like they sheep
Man the tassels on them Ballys
Checkers or the Rally's
Saying "I don't think they got it like in Cali"
Alaskan Ice
The light bulbs in my jewels show off in the night
half-moon crescent
Wow, it looks beautiful
The stars is praising me
"oh my God! No he didn’t"
give him a bib, cause he keeps spitting
Lines that's so cold where every word's frost-bitten
And his man's pulling up in the Maybach
White linen ,three quarter rope, Ballys from way back
With Cardier frames, white gold all around the rim
