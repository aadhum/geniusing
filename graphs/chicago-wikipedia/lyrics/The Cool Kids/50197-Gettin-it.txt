If I had a hundred grand
And I'll be god damned if I throw it in the air Like I didn't care
And I must say it's no way and nowhere
There's no pocket full of cash too be thrown in tha air
Cause I could take that and spend pair of
M8 gears with the front tips and the lights in the rear
Use my spare change with the green handle bars where the grips is clear
The cool kids in the sandbox ya'll can't play
Cause back on my west coast L.A lakers, 32 Johnson jersey
And They tell me I could do it, juss do it clean
But I'm from the dirty south, I dunno what that means
If she got nice legs she can run on my team (yea)
Now watch me snap like a jump suit
And I work all day like the phone booth
Sometimes shit gets too thick for me too comb thur
And I juss need a relaxer and some shampoo
We get money and we smoke like candle
Stick it to the script like java,
