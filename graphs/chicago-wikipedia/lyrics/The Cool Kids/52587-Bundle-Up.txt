Who told you that you can sit with the kids
Computer wiz niggas still can't figure it out though
Got indo
got out-doe,
Nissan Patrol with the Bose stereo, yo
I dug holes trying to grow my seeds
I got plug like the back of the screen man!
You got designs on the back of your jeans
Many, they steam and I’m cold as a lean cuisine
Coming fresh out the freezer,
I’m clean to the Caesar
The only third grader in the school with a beeper
Clipped to the seams, front pocket of them Wranglers
My teacher took it from me, it's funny how she snatched it
Sleepers can’t sleep if it’s money in the mattress
A lot of niggas still running from their taxes and bills
We feel real, recognize each other man
Damn, goin' ham, Got it hotter than the Mother Land
Bundle up (bundle up) – man you gotta bundle up
Bundle up (bundle up) – I said you gotta bundle up
Bundle up (bundle up) – they said itʼs gonna be cold today
In the city of the frozen lakes!
This glass is half full around here home slice
fam-o
Now let me pose for this photo!
It's me standing out in the snow with my coat on right?
Means I’m getting hotter now, given how cold it's been out
and that's honest
Ironic that we the hottest you’ve seen in the minute comin'
And we ain’t going green like global warming!
But I do get that organic license on me!
Kind of buds you only blowing out in California
Whole food shopping's what me and all my partners call it
'92 Saab 900 with the spoiler,
away game white, baby blue Houston Oiler
Mount Clemens, Michigan and Metro Detroiter
Residing in Chicago where its gets a little colder
