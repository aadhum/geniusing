Girl's moms wish they daughters would have met me first
She dig pro ball players, love what they drivin'
Girl it ain't the car it's the nigga that's drivin'
And if it ain't American then I can't even drive it
Windows way down
engine start pipin'
Rumblin', drop the frame touch down jugglin'
The ball: won't drop it or fumble it though
Dolphin skin greys white strings in the lace air elevens
Cold case when we was in eleventh grade
Don't let me hear you say that chuck ain't dope (nope)
Cause if you did you'd be tellin' a joke
Now that's funny bro
And I'm laughin' all the way to the bank
Bank shot off the glass, peep my no-look pass
Like
We on net, field goal match point (match point)
Touchdown bet a pound flip a coin (flip a coin)
We champions, baby, where my trophy at?
We got handles baby, don't reach
You can see 'em both talking, both walkin' at the same pace
Both heels clickin' like they runnin' in the same race
Same clothes, same face, 20-carat ankle bracelet
a-wrapped
Baby blue infinity truck
In the baby blue carolina sweatsuit, ten and a half
cash rules everything around my set
'92 corvette
Hilfiger jacket zipped to the bottom of my neck
Now pass me a swish like the bottom of the net
