So I woke up this mornin'
And as I start yawnin'
That milk milk pourin'
Into my bowl
Then I thought to myself
Thought thought to myself
That I need to take a trip to the grocery sto'
Cause the bread is low
And the chicken I was eating with the mashed potatoes
Need
a little bit of gold
Oops wrong song lyric
Meant a little bit of pepper
Step out the crib with the bearclaw slippers
Robe tied tight, chest no chest hairs
Sto' close at fo' so I gotta get there
Cause it's like 3:50 and I'm just waking up
And it take five minutes just to get to the front
Now I'm standing in long lines
Lady with the baby
Probably buying some dog food
Dog probably crazy
On a daily basis my days be like this
Cause I got to the register and then the store closed
I'm tryna buy some new shit - what you tryin' to spend?
All I got is five dollars - so you broke man?
I thought I had ten dollars - so you broke then?
TV dinner on the counter - warm it up then!
Aiyyo come, get some, you little bums
I got a lot and you can't get none
That ice cream truck just left, if you run
You can catch - but it's out cause I got the last one
But I got a box of cones that I'm willing to sell
I'll sell the ice cream too, two scoops for a bill
I could build a sand castle without bringing a pail
And go catfish fishing and come up with a whale
But but you know what, that was easy as hell
Well maybe not the line about me catching a whale
But if I did it then it's nothing and I did it as well
Probably easy as it is to move slow for a snail
Did you know I made this beat with my mouth and a bell?
Just a F.Y.I., I'm F-L-Y
And for those that can't spell, I'm a pretty swell guy
I caught a lot of fish I think I'll have a fish fry
