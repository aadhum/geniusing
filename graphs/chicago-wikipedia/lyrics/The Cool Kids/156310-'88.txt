Niggas beat-boxing
I do what I do like I do it for TV
I grab a mic I rock it from 9-5
E-Z Rock beats with bass, ladies calling me Rob
Base, Base, Base, Base
I'm on my '88 shit
Cazal frame lense
Rocking top 10 kicks
I'm back on my job
I press and twist knobs
Just to make your head nod
Do the smurf, Do the wop, Baseball bat
Rooftop, like I'm bringing '88 back
Separating people from the squares
Like a nicotine patch
We can dance if you wanna
We can leave your friends behind
Cause if your friends don't dance
And if they don't dance
Then they ain't no friends of mine
I'm the fresh prince
And that means I'm Will
'88 frames on Adidas track suit
