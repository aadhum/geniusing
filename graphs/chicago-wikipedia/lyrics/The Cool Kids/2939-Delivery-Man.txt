I never had a stain on my shirt
Not work, work
But I shelf boxes of hotness
Don't drop it
Materials of value in those boxes
I'm Sugar Ray Leonard to them Boxers
I pick mine, get twist mine, Jack it'll work
I got a smiley face have a nice day t-shirt
Mikey said you should wear it at our next concert
Hands in the air even if your arms don't work
The Cool Kids banging on the speakers in your car system
Me and Mikey present: "When Fish Ride Bicycles"
Drop the hook
I go bananas before I let the monkey throw the wrench in
Old folks still waiting on your pension
I'm your new landlord just call me when the rent's in
