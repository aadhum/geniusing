Dooney & Bourke
I was buying mikes when they was trippin' with the prices
I'm nasty like your first time trying beer
The second one is better like the remix to ignition
serve, swing, Pete Sampras
I wanna talk to Sampson
Man for real, these niggas stealin' my clothes
Like "Chuck, I seen you with them and I had to get those"
Trust me, don't tie your shoes. That tight looks ugly
Guaranteed like a jail phone call
Lights out Bitch!
