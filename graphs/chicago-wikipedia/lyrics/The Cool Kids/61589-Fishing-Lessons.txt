[Intro]
Damn when I get paid
I'mma get me them dope new Nikes, like ten pairs
And I'mma get me some stupid gold holmes, crazy gold
Like this tooth right here
And a five finger gold ring
With my tag bustin' all out that motherfucker
When they hear it they gone be like "This go hard then a bitch!"
Cartier's
Man, I been captain since Animanics
had packs
And had black Bulls patches on his jacket
Them top notch Nautica nice guys
The same range that Nas had in Belly
