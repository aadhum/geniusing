I brush a lot of shoulders
I hold a lot of babies
What's up? This is us, politicking with the ladies
I'm in the cut--
I brush a lot of shoulders and I hold a lot of babies
I brush a lot of shoulders and I hold a lot of babies
I brush a lot of shoulders and I hold a lot of babies
What's up? This is us, politicking with the ladies
Check the flavour we kick, know it all like we majored in this
But I ain't finish school (nope)
Shame that these niggas don't pay me
People always wanna know where do I be at?
People think Phil put Jordan on the map
Just let your head bang like there's hammers in your hat
Either that or sail a boat rollin up another garcia
You ain't heard? Me and Mike the bees knees around here
