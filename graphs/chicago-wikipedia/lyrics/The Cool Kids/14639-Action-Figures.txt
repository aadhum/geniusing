My images stay in the hood like the reaper's skull
Now he's buried under the hood like transmissions
And they ain't running on treadmills when they running to get rid of the extra weight
Same concept though, they just run in place
No progress, you always see the same faces
Over and over the cops pulling you over
To make sure they filling their quota
And then asking you if you sell drugs or shoot like rappers do
That's the image we was given, didn't like it from beginning
Cuz the records that we spinning disrespectful to our women
Can't say I'm not involved cuz they say I am a dog
That's one of my biggest flaws but that was all I was taught
That's all that I know
God forbid when they meet
Po-pos on the street
Crooked cops is the biggest gang on the block patrolling the streets
While you trying to pose hard like mannequin men
Fully poseable arms with no kung-fu grip
Cuz you a doll not an action figure
Cuz you don't want action nigga
If you ain't auditioning for a snail movie u ain't got to act slow
Yo it's like T-bones on top shelves, the stakes is high
I let it drizzle on your brain like the filling when it rain
It's like a scripture from Matthews
Bide my time unwind the twist tie and throw it back at you/achoo
I'm a let you do you if you let me do mine
