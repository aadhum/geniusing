When I hop behind the wheel
Of that hot piranha red Dodge Challenger
The caliber of dudes in my association
It's like them Halliburton dudes corporation
Keep paid, keep safe
Just in case we skate out of the state
With a couple of then easy racks
We be back
Tasmanian fur when I burr for the freezing cats
Keep my doors locked like the hair under Weezy hat
This old man was smoking to The Chi-Lites
He started speaking of secret societies and 33rd degrees and his son
The whole universe
The keys to unlock it
Prophet...I had to consider my options
