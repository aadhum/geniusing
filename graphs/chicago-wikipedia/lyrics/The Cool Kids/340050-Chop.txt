Live nigga brought back the starter
When I get there first I'mma call you
Looking like a tall glass of water in the drop
Sound like I'm trapping out the Carter
It's the part, put the hammer on the blammer
Line it up, let it bump like it's Tony Montana
Wanna know who I stash this for
Couldn't really tell you if you ask me though
Couldn't really tell if she had ass or no
A ten in the face is all I ask her for
We was riding 'round like the Wu-Tang
Wallabees Tommys and the North Face
Nautica sailing like a boat race
Small gold chain on my chest like a neck brace
I can do anything, everything is in my range now
Pick up where we left it semi-precious stone store records
Bullets in the chamber but an early dismissal
Is not out of the question
I'm not about to wrestle
Way too skinny to be the guinea
Pig we be testing on
We kick it like Ash and Brock
We cook it like Action Bronson in the dope pot
The LSD make my room look like cosmic bowls
You know that some of them try to rhyme
But they can't rap like this
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't, no no
Said some of them try to rhyme
But they can't rap like this
Some of them try to rhyme but they can't
