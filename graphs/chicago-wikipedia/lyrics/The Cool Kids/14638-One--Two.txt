One, two, lace up my shoes
Three to the four when I stepped out the door
Five, six, kick a little something with The Cool Kids then we do it again
What it is, what it is
It's the new black version of the Beastie Boys
Chuck-Ie, Mikey, some dudes don't like me
Don't care, I'm dope, they lame so bite me
Find a rock to kick or a bridge to jump off
Smooth as the vinyl in the black bag
Stumble like the wino with the brown bag
Size 10 Jedis
Obi-Wan Kenobi
Chuck was dope but chuck is cold
As a ice cream cone in a Iceland snowstorm
Feeling like a ceiling fan blowing out the window
Midway city is the city where wind blows
Fairly cold
frigerator
a little bit of gold
Infrared Spike Lee Jordan number fours
Bow for a second then I pause for applause
Let it rain clear it out, that's the proper protocol
When I steps on the court with the ball on the floor
You dribbling around just being a ball hog
If I ain't got the shot then I dish to my partner
Step behind the arc, I cross, I Byron Scott-er
If you want it I got it, dripping like water
