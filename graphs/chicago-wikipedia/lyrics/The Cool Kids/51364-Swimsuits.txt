This is what should be playin in them Jeeps
Swimsuit girls at the pool, beach
In town from L.A.,
So cold in the D
Went to school in Atlanta, in Chicago for the week
Friends and their friends can get in
SWAT team
I lost both keys
Nameâ€™s Chuck Inglish, Room 313
And it's boomin'
scooters,
ATVs
Out in Hawaii, parasail, jet skis
Watching sexy little spicy mamacitas I see ya
Cash bar only, no need for the Visas
A lot of girls walk around here in bikinis
Hot tub on the boat,
rolling joints by the lake
Twist up the Grape Ape
Yeah it's our year great view up here?
put on your swimsuit
Two straws is pokin' out the coconut, I gave her a sip
Showboating, now I'm all in the mix
Only toasting purp weed.
Degrees in the high 80's
'Fore I even said "Hi ladies"
Said I seen you on Collins,
The car you was driving
The lights turned on like eyelids
Then the light turned green
And a scene from Ice Cream Man popped up into my head
When P had the white Lexus, Silkk had the headband
You and your man's looked like them
Right then my right hand reached my cell phone
And I needed her right name to type in
First name, Mike man,
write on the white sand
That's where you can find me
I be in the Bahamas
Your girl wanna chill and I drill when I wanna
The real on the real nigga, keep it a hundo
With a Cubano finna Mambo
You see the trunk from the front like Dumbo
Good drinks,
good view from the condo
Say that ain't a good combo?
