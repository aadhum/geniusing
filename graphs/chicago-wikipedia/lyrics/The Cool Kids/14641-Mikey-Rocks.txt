Hold the phone like a call on the other line
I'm on the phone with a bone of another kind
Grip hand, you might need assistance
Then we can kick it like kickstands and
You know I pedal til the chain slip
It's repelling to rappers as soon as I stage hit
high end
I don't use bad grammar so please excuse this
I'm just trying to let niggas know who I is
Sayonora to afros and old flows
The concept of rocking shows is so old
Just keep them off the wall like Vans logos
Cause if you got change in your pocket
Then instantly the dames start flocking
Inglish
snares and kicks
Now it's a riot on the track
