Kick it in the city when we in around town
Chuck Inglish
Turn it up, I don't think they hear it enough
Back when Jordans' and a gold chain was livin it up
Auburn Hills, Michigan - home of the palace
The place on the map where Isaiah beat Magic
Throwin elbows
had them Rick Mahorn habits
With the 8-9 bad boy hammer on my cap
Tell 'em, kiss it off the glass or, pass or, kick it
I'm Coach Chuck Daly, a/k/a Daddy Rich
the flicker of the flicks
All net, finger roll, Allan Houston off the pick
the pick, of the litter with the kicks
Twistin off the faucet washin washin spittin while I'm walkin
Then I start thinkin I should hit the sink and get the flossin
Awesome and then I hear the Mrs. barkin
Not my Mrs., Mrs. Wilson from the yard across us
I'm a Minute Maid man, made minutes into paper
The vapors, now cue the steam, who is it you see?
Sittin down with some twins now I'm wishin it was two of me
