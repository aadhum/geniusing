[Intro: Steve Harvey]
Hey player, I knew you was gonna come back
Left something didn't ya?
With ya cool ass
Told me back stage his name Boogie
All right, Boogie
What you do for a living, Boogie?
I go to Computer school
Computer school, hmmm
I'm the reason that these copy niggas wanna be themselves
The reason that they put them black mags on the wheels
I originated cool, come on cuz
I'm the reason niggas started rocking gold
A bunch of lil niggas dropping out of school
Trying to be like me
Be like Chuck Inglish, boy quit it
This The Cool Kids' table where you sit
Better late than never, though
Two is better than that
Spend my money on stocks
Air boats and off roading
Bird brain you're winging it!
Don't try shit, my bodyguards talk like Smaug from The Hobbit
I wrote this by the pool, bitch
Listening to Wu
Took a lot of y'all to school
Back at it like we new
You know what we gone do
You've seen it on the news
Reporting live from the trunk
Hey, this is what you want
On assignment I'm styling out the sun roof wildin'
Tell them kids to go inside
Like we out here shooting dice
Brick phone still on from '96
Magic Johnson retired, I cried real tears
We need to run this back again
[Outro: Steve Harvey]
