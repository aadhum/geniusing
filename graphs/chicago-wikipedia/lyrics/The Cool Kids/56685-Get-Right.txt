Ma, don't waste you're time
You with the wrong dude if you waitin' in line
Talkin' that bull shit, soon to blow
We ain't mad at you girl, you don't know
Look, don't let life stress you out
Tell me where you going, let me ash you out
Check the boards ma, we put up numbers
Come on, let's get right for the summer
And I'm Nautica'd out to the socks
Fortune 500 CEOs on the yacht
We don't talk about cash, we talk about stocks
I ain't there for them Heat though, I'm here on the beach
If I go to the club, I ain't gotta spend nothing
They got a table ready like
"I hear Chuck's coming"
You on the fence now
You said you like who?
You never tried what? But you would like to
You goddam right you got a right to the high life
line out their salary income
I started rap team, but all of that cream
That'd be harder than a gang member bat swing
The other half of me wanna smash like a crash dummy
buck tooth
