Cause I can't get a nine-to-five So I rhyme
I... I... I rock
If you don't think so nigga kick rocks
And if looks could kill then she'd be in jail
Freeze!
Now take my picture
I drive a 5.0 GT that is
Drop-top roof with the Dayton's on the wheels
Then flip the Sidekick peep my options (yeah)
Go down the list like "hmmm not that one"
Maybe her tomorrow but that's after
I find out just what she's after
If it's dough then she gotta get gon'
She'll never get a call like broken phones
(I ain't got no penthouse)
We party on the rooftop
