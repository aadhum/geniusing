The Pistons got the eighth seed in the east might not be all year
But at least we in there
I woke up out of bed and I wash my face
Brush my teeth my routine
I do the same thing all week, know what I mean
The top ten adidas
and the DMC jumper
The way I lace the laces up make 'em look dumber
Colder than a cherry shaved ice in the summer
I was a good at double-dribble, duck hunt and mario three
But fuck paperboy paper wasn't usually seen
we turn nights into AM
