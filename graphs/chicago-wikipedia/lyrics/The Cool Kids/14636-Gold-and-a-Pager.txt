With a little bit of gold and a pager
Pedal down the foothills, wheelies on the front wheel
(for real Chuck?)
Not for play homebro
I made those and those
I skate those in these
Four finger ring
on my belt buckle strap
Got to hold up my jeans cause they falling off my ass
Then you got to check these Nikes at the bottom of my pants
Then you got to check my hip cause my beeper's on blast
Just got it activated, you ain't even got to ask
So if my phone's off you can page my ass
So I guess what is is I'm who I is
And I'm well aware, a gold rope's what I wear
And they're big and they hang and they swang here to there
Mikey Rocks, I'm a graduate of Cooley High
The last day of school threw my hat in the air
With a new pair of shoes with the gum sole
and I flicked like a glass fixture
When the tip of your finger hits the switch
Motorola pager
Been blessed with this gift since the day before Christmas
I'm trying, I am nice with the science
On how to stay king of this jungle just like lions
move just like a bumble bee
So please no steez biting
I'm just a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
