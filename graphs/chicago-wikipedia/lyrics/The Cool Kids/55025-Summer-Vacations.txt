Jeeps ride in the summer
Any other time other than the summer if we ride, we just might freeze
Hoes looking for them niggas in the fresh white tees
The light poles got cameras
There you go, say "cheese"
Drinking Carlo Rossi with my west coast posse
Ted DiBaise
We so far gone that's word to my man Drizz
