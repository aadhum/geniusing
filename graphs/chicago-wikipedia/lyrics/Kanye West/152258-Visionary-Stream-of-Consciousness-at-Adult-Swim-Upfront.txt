I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I ain't no motherfucking celebrity.
I don't know if y'all know this one thing about me, but I'm a terrible, terrible, terrible celebrity
I don't know if you know this one thing about me, but I'm the worst kind, the worst kind, the worst kind of celebrity.
Because all I do is make real music. All I do is sit in the studio and make real, real shit. And that's it. That's motherfucking it, that's motherfucking it
So I don't want nobody coming up to me with no cameras trying to like, sell pictures and shit to magazines.
Y'all take the pianos an octave down.
somebody asked me "when you do SNL, are you going to do like a skit about the paparazzi and shit and like humanize yourself?"
It ain't about me humanizing myself
At what point did I become so inhuman where I had to turn myself back? Or maybe I was demonized, maybe I was treated inhumane in that type of situation.
I ain't kissing nobody's motherfucking babies--I drop your baby and then you sue me and shit
Motherfuckers chasing you down about to make you crash into shit, and all they want you to make is a nigga to laugh and shit.
Hell no I ain't doing no 'SNL' skits
