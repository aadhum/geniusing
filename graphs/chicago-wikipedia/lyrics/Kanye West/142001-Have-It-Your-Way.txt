Don’t want nobody to die
Don’t want to have to ride but in this game
I guess that’s just the way, I guess that’s just the way
Have it your way
It’s gonna be slow singing, flower bringing
Gat clinging, bat swinging, bullets flyin’, niggas dyin’
Mom’s cryin
I felt the hatred, cause when I turned around like the Matrix
Comin for me, an array of bullets headin dead for me
First the one, and then came the two and three and four
Five, six, seven, shots from a mac 11
Platinum producer killed by haters tonight on Channel 7
Ya know my piece is, hotter than grease is
With no wrong way to eat ya face like a Reese’s
Now everybody got a gun in they hand, yeah bitch nigga run to ya man
Especially talkin’ bout havin’ ice on and I could barely keep my lights on
I feel like, my whole city on my back
I feel like, next year, my whole city on the map
I’m from, Chi town, where the raps the realest
gorilla
