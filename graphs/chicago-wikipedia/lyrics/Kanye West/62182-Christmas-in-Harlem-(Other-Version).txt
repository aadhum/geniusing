[Hook: Teyana Taylor]
Christmas in Harlem
Right after autumn falls
Soakin’ it all in
Then we go hit the mall
Even though we ain’t ballin’
Feels like we bought it all
The mistletoe’s right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin’ the good life
Yeah, though it’s forty below the wind chill
And we wipin’ snow up off the windshield
It’s still, wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I’m, so happy I’m with my baby
And we a li’l late wit’ the Christmas gifts
Rushin’ for the mall, don’t trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that “You the star at the top of my Christmas tree”
My only question is, “Where my presents?”
She said, “Shhh,” she got a gift for me that ain’t for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in you drink, mami
Got a surprise for you that ain’t on your Christmas list-es
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said “It’s D-ricious”
First, I wanted to say Merry Christmas to y’all
For Santa Claus, so bake a turkey, burn a few logs
I be there soon, on my sled, me and Rudolph
Thugs think I’m a Blood ’cause I won’t take this red suit off
Her voice slow ’cause “I always got a sore throat”
You never see me ’cause I shop when the stores close
And my sleigh go faster than the Porsche go
Ha, I got nine reindeers
That’s Dancer, that’s Prancer on the fourth flo’
That’s Comet, that’s Cupid, that’s Vixen
That’s Donner, that’s Dasher, that’s Blitzen
[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
All the flashin’ lights up on a tree
The house lit up ni-ice
Wit’ your family’s where you wanna be
Here on Christmas night
When you wake up and you see the gifts
Don’t that make you feel go-ood?
So since we all snowed in in Harlem
Let’s have Christmas in the hoo-hood
[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
All of the flashin’ light
Yeah, when they shine so bright
Always for you and me
Baby, you’re Christmas Eve
If you like what you see me
Won’t you come sit on my knee?
Tell me everything that you want
‘Cause, baby, I’m your Santa Claus
