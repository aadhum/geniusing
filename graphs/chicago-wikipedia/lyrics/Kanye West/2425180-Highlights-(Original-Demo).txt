Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
We only makin' the highlights
Tell my mama, tell my mama, that I only want my whole life to only be highlights
(I want to play with you all night long
Then after the night)
Can we play that back one time?
And after that night I'm gon' wanna play this shit back, I don't know
You got to get up every morning
You got to get up every morning
You got to get up every morning
With a smile on a face
And show the world all the love in your heart
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastelle
Walkin', livin', breathin', girl you know my past well
Hard to believe in God, your nigga got killed
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
I love social media, I love fitness, and I love photography
with ChloÃ« Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny
