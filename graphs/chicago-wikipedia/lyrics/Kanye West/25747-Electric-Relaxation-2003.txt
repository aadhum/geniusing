(You got to...)
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
Relax yourself, or we'll back you down
All day long man, we back in town
Homie check it out I got her mesmerized
So when your hooker choose Cons, she telling you "Bye"
Street poetry is how your boy get paid
And when I walk up in the club, you know I do not pay
Aiyyo my name is Kanyeezy
Roc-A fam
Where the Glocks don't jam, so when we pop, them scrams
See I showed you on "The Champions" how we get down
So don't twist your lips up like Bobby Brown
You got B2K all on your bedroom wall
But if you be with Kan', I'm gonna work your walls
Straight from the South Side of them Chi-Town streets
The top three in the game, with these here beats
You staring at my rose gold way too long
that's why I wear Teflon
So if you want the drama, holler at your boy
Original rude boy like Pastor Troy
The G-500 is my favorite toy
They say "he don't look like a thug or a hood"
"But he keep them gorilla's, so he still be good"
By the way my name is K, don't forget the A
And the N-Y-E, out N.Y.C
I'mma still rep the gold, no matter where I go
Everybody say I'm hot, I'm sayin I'm cold
Hate when niggas leave the city and switch up they raps
On the real homie, I don't get down like that
I'mma milk the game, 'til we all can eat
Now the Chocolate Factory is what I bump in my jeep
So roll me up a L, but don't lace it with leak
'Cause that shit'll have me zoning for a couple of weeks
Now your momma told you let the cleavage show
'Cause that's the best way, to get a nigga with dough
They'll fake a pregnancy, and call the attorney up
But she ain't know I'm cheaper than IKEA furniture
