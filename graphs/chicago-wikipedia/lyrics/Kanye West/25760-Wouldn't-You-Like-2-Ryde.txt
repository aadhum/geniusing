[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Liquor store out of Arbor Mist
we Irish Rosed it up
Then we rolled to the movies, you rocked your fake Chloes
You had Gap and Gucci, that's still two G's
Ooh you so bougie boo you could have fooled me
Cuz five years ago you was so Fugees
Now you don't want nothin' unless it cost a few Gs
You like the light-skinned Ania, the dark-skinned Aaliyah
The black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on your cell, but not Nokia
It be goin' in and out, that's why I barely hear ya
It be goin' in and out like a robbery ah
I'm tryin' to take this money like Rob and G. Dep
Then I'mma take you to the house like Trick and Trina
Malik Yusef, bet your baby momma know the name
The most critically acclaimed wordsmith in the game
Never a pretty boy, always a beautiful mind like Russell Crowe
Now you in places no cabs'll take you, only the bus'll go
Stiflin'
All you wanna do is shop at River Oaks
Thought my real nigga quotes would make you truer
so I passed her like a reverend
Returned to my Bishop Juan ways goin'
Wild West like Kanye
Wherever I lay my ??? is my home,
You still wanna ride though
