So after walking through here I decided that I wanted to make sure for anyone that didn’t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show.
you can have tickets for the entire office!
I really do believe that the world can be saved through design
everything needs to actually be “architected.”
DONDA
were architects that started designing t-shirts instead of buildings.
So the reason why I turn up so much in interviews
is because I’ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact, and affect in a positive way.
I believe that utopia is actually possible
but we’re led by the least noble, the least dignified, the least tasteful, the dumbest, and the most political.
