Niggas old as hell, trying to get they rapping on
In the club looking like a fucking chaperone
"Guess Who's Back"
If not that then the Just Blaze track is on
It's all Roc the world
we all got your girl
Caught your girl
never gave back your girl
Watch the rap unfurl, after Beanie Mack confirm
Kanye best producer-rapper in the world
Now I have beans
they bite
they plagiar-us
They spit the style for the niggas that made it up
That's like me buying soul beats for my album
I hold beats for my album
February 18th
Niggas forcing me to keep the heat up
Black strap, white handle, I got
Jungle Fever
I'm in the game getting change like a parking meter
And since Takeover
They like "Damn, I heard you charging 50 a track! I mean
You can at least give me a stack
You can't do all that hard work yourself and not give nothing back
You know how shit change when your name get to buzzing
This year alone I got two dozen new cousins
Niggas popping out the woodworks, talking about "you owe me"
Mama, I'm famous, niggas hate me that don't know me
I see an SUV and the window rolled down and shit!
And this black lady from Chicago, she like
"Yo, um, I just bought one of these in black."
You know I just got the G5 or whatever
She like, "I just got one of these in black
How does it drive?"
I'm like, "it drive more like a truck than my last one."
I'm like, "yo, but I'm from Chicago, too. I wanna be on your show!"
She said "yo, well, oh, ok, well, who are you?"
a rapper
