Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Head to the sky, wings raised and
She's about to fly and take her place in
Out there in the stars when she leaves the ground
But ain't no going back, this is how it must be
He told her she'll be burned alive, she just told him "trust me"
If funerals are beautiful, this ugly
Hard to hide his feelings, as it engulfs her
Now she's a bright blaze, light rays
A shooting out, a phoenix on fire burning up the nightscape
So lets hear it for our heroine
Applaud as her spirit just flies into the never-end
One closed chapter, it opens up another part
So this is more like the end, question mark
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
Don't let me hold you back, I only hold you back
We're on a dead-end street, this block has got a cul-de-sac
So fly baby, my baby so high
Sometimes it's so hard to say bye
We made it from the alley straight up to the valley
We pulled up at the valet
We'll raise us a Beyonce
maybe she'll be a Halle
You would've been the best mom, I would have been the best 'Ye
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
we go, no baby, me go
You got my heart, baby this what it beat for
I give it all, walk as far as my feet go
What you mean "me go", why can't it be "we go"?
What happens when people turn to tears (huh?)
Dreams turn to memories and weeks turn to years,
huh?
Standing in the same spot for a couple of weeks
Give me my feelings back, wish love came with a couple receipts
Man, our vacation was coming next week
Girl, I swear you was a trip, let's make it a couples' retreat
Woke up to a note saying "the world did this to me"
Drinking all I can so I can turn to fire when I hug you
But its not even half the feeling as hearing your "Seans, you know I love you‚Äù
Shedding tears everyday, and I'm tired of lying in these puddles
I ask why sometimes, like a fucking vowel
Been hitting trees everyday, like a fucking owl
Of the phoenix sun to Nash it out
I know you can see me now
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Fly like an eagle, whatever you do
Don't look down, it's an impossible view
Spread your wings, aerial
