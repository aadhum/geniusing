Yo it's the Lake Shore Drive
You better hurry up, they can't keep it in the store
Tryna flex your technique
You gettin' blasted with a TEC, that shit is mad ironic
Like Alanis Morisette
you try but can't jet
Bunch of airline lyrics, rhymes for low fare
Flyin' out of O'Hare
While these no-name ass niggas wanna go there, nobodies
Livin' three blocks from nowhere, down the street from nothin'
Let me show these niggas somethin', visual aid, the page
But they wanna play the role, actin' hardcore
Watch the whole career, flow, my style is too cold
Always, forever like Luther
Live and die for rhymes, dedicated to hip-hop
Shit don't stop
Niggas they wanna know what and who's next
And you roll up in a Lex
That's the train stop,
my brain drop mad lyrics
I rhyme with the spirit off the top, I drop nonstop
Like EPMD y'all niggas ain't seein' me
what
We're enormous, nah, do or die
I got the rhymes on the brain
Bring it on, pass it to my man Tariq
Rock the mic all week
