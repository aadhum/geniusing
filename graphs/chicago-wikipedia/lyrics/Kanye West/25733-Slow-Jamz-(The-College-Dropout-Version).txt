Kanye, it's Foxx, man
I'm just sayin' I was talkin' to the girls you know
And we don't put enough emphasis on the ladies sometime
You know, I was talkin' to this girl
She was talkin' about the music all fast in the club you know
She gotta drink water cause she thirsty
She danced like ninety-two hundred songs back to back
With ain't nobody really try to find out what she feelin'
Like how she feel... you know what she told me?
Are you gonna be? (Check it out, this is what she said)
Say that you're gonna be (Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, oooooo)
She said she want some Marvin Gaye, some Luther Vandross
A little Anita will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)
She said she want some Ready For The World, some New Edition
Some Minnie Riperton will definitely set this party off right
(are you gonna be, are you gonna be, are you gonna be
Are you gonna be, are you gonna be, well well well well)

I told her to drive over in yo new whip, bring some friends you cool wit
I'mma bring the cool whip, then I want you to strip
See you is my new chick, so we get our grind on
She be grabbin' me, callin' me Biggie like Shyne home
Man I swear she fine homes, why she always lyin' though?
Tellin' me them diamonds, when she know they rhinestones
She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
Got a dark-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson
I played Ready For The World, she was ready for some action
My dog said you ain't no freak , so you bout to prove my man wrong
I'mma play this Vandross, you gon' take yo pants off

Al Green, OH!

Whatcha know about the Isley Brothers?
Now Kanye, I know I told you to slow it down
It's good, it's all good, it's beautiful
But now I need you to do it faster baby
Can you please - do it faster, baby, do it faster
Damn baby, I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can, Twista!
Got you looking at the glist on my hands and wrist
While I'm layin' back and smoking on my cannabis
When it come to rockin' the rhythm like Marvin and Luther
I can tell you ain't no messin' with Kan man and Twist
In the Chi and I be sippin' Hennessy - play some R&B
While I smoke a b - you can preferably find that I'm a G
Come wit me and sip on some Evelyn Champagne
You ain't know Twista could work it like the Whispers?
Rims still movin' so I bump a lil' Spinners
While I'm smoking on a b -
Wit my Earth in the Wind smoking Fire
Let me get ya sheets wet listenin' to Keith Sweat
Put you in a daze wit Maze
Fulfilling her wit every temptation, slow jam, and havin' deep sex
You ready for the world girl, come on go wit me
I touch you all over your body baby don't say no to me
And every moment be controlling me
Jodeci
you be bumpin' Teddy Pendergrass
And when some Luther come on I hope you feelin' me
