I've lived
Yes I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each, and every highway
Much more, much more than this
I did it my way...
It go my way, Chi-Way
This way or the highway
Shots'll lay you off on your day off, like Friday
The ROC got 'Ye, but they ain't snortin' it
They just got him up at Baseline recordin' shit
Yeah I've been broke
Now I'm good bitch
I ain't no Kennedy
But I'm hood rich
I took the road less traveled, the unbeaten path
I've been beatin', but never broken through the darkest past
It's sort of like when King spoke and said we free at last
Ain't nothin' free from that point, though
We needed cash
And we need it fast
We broker than Ethiopians just tryin' to eat at last
Now all the blacks cookin' up, they're almost white
Cause gettin' green makes 'em treat us like we almost white
Almost
Chi-Way
On their local mix-tapes
There they go again, lyin' to consumers
Get their hair cut in the little shop of rumors
Your lil' sloppy with your cockyness ain't ya?
A little arrogant with all your comparisons
I got the most plaques since the beginnin' of rap
Y'all just talk about my dough
How I left Chicago
How I'm the only one eatin'
Shut your pie hole
And you a parrot, you copy what I do and say?
When you walk straight, niggas tend to look at you sideways
I say, fuck that, dog, I get my own way
Niggas ain't believe me, 'til they see me on TV
And seen K freely, gettin' head on the freeway
Then pass her to Freeway, just like it's a relay
We stay 4 stars or better
And back, before Benzes, when we could afford Jettas
Stay gettin' somethin' off lay-a-way at Marshall's
