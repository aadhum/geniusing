We ain't finna play with them no more. "***Flawless", Beyoncé video. And Beck needs to respect artistry, and he should've given his award to Beyoncé.
Because what happens is, when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music, you're disrespectful to inspiration.
We as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day, and they listen to that Beyoncé album and they feel like it takes them to another place.
Then they do this whole promotional event, they'll run the music over somebody’s speech, the artist, because they want commercial advertising.
