I guess I get mad when you get boxed in
So mad, you wanna start boxin'
So mad, you gonna turn to Tyson
Slicin' and dicin'
Paparazzi, I'm like a Nazi to 'em
I'm not Bill Cosby to 'em
And I ain't Bing Crosby
More like [?] to 'em
Aye yo, I've got to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to doin'
When people usually do music
I am a visionary,
Christian soldier, don't confuse it
Burn it down, burn Hollywood, burn like Ice Cube said
I'm the rudest, a lot of people say that
My crib's spatial and my relationship is interracial
I don't know where to start, I don't know where to start
Maybe the chart, maybe the heart
Maybe the flow, maybe the gold
Where I was grown, what I grew up in
straight from Chicago
Aye, yo, like IBM or Apple, Steve Jobs of this
You heard me on Jimmy Kimmel, I can do it every tempo
I wanna build a temple, I wanna build churches
I might short-circuit, I might just black out
Hit you with that "BLOCKA!"
You know I'm Ibaka
Number One Chief Rocker, Number One Chief Rocker
Ain't nobody gon' stop him, ain't nobody gon' stop us
Because God on my side
One time I had lost my faith
But I had to stay faithful and grateful for the God I was given
See, when I was 30, I had 6 parents
Grandmother, grandfather, grandmother, grandfather
Mother, father, now I've only got one parent
Life could change in a blink, and that is apparent
But still you've got to stay strong
Sometimes I don't listen to music, I just need to zone out
Sometimes I don't listen to music, everybody clones now
But sometimes I be in music and feel like it's a prison
But see, I wanna do everything
And I know I could do everything
And be anything that I wanna be
I wanna be like Christ, I wanna be that nice
You know what I'm saying?
Okay, this beat just threw me off
