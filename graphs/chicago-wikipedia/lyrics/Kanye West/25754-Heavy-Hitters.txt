You rappers think I give a fuck about the way that they spit
Wanna be on my album but don't want me on they shit
Everybody thought I was makin' a compilation
I was really makin' myself they competition
Fresh off the plane from the All-Star game
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave
'Til I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Gotta lotta problems, money's one that I not have no more
Uh, well Dame look at how everybody changed
Tell Jay that I'm 'bout to change the game
Tell B.I.G. that we about to get paid
All my niggas about to have it made
Goddamn Kanye! (Kanye, Kanye)
Ain't nobody messin' with me dog
I told dude "You can't even rap on my interlude"
Now does that make me as rude as Jude?
Yamamoto Adidas is sick with the fashion
The way ya rhyme give me Tribe Called QuestÂ‹ flashbacks
And let's not even bring up the tracks man
Nope, nope, let's not do that man
You eatin' up the game like Pac-Man
He got the whole world shakin' just like crack fiends
Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
I used to work at the mall with nothin' at all
Seein' niggas that ball, that shit was depressin'
Keep my clothes in the cleaners, I ain't with the pressin'
two hoes like John Ritter
Roc-a-Fella is fo' life
Throw your diamonds up, throw your diamonds up
Throw your diamonds
