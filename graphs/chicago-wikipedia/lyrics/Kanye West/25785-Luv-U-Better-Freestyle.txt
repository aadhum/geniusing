Yo it's your boy, super pro-huhum, I mean super RAPPER Kanye West
[Verse 1]
Was it because of the Roc
That she wanna rock with West?
Because after the Blueprint I got lots of checks
She don't play X-Box but got a box of X
That make her tongue move faster than Das EFX
I ain't gon' lie they only fives but together they tens
Hummm, it's like old folks pissin' cause it all Depends
And there's no coke sniffin', just juice and gin
Grey Goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin'
The track that got you movin'
Buyin' boots just to tell 'em that I Jimmy choose 'em
See she don't know if she's comin' or goin'
Cause mommy after I'm cummin' I'm goin'
Back to the show
Just frontin' and flowin'
Jewelry stuntin' and glowin'
It's like somethin' outta nowhere
Yeah, and I've been known to have a ho or two
Cause my diamond's yellow like a smoker tooth
Roll a joint, smoke a few
After that I'm pokin' you
After that it's over boo
Baby grab your coat and peeeeuuuun
She said, "I love you K."
"I know you do. If I was you I'd love me too."
How she gonna tell K about L.A.?
When I got three hoes that stay in Marina Del Ray
Voice high like Mich'elle
