[Verse 1]
'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up out a movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'd turn my life to Stephen King's
Up late night like she on parole
Checking everything like I'm on parole
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, Ok, Ok
You will never stop it now
You need to stop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Verse 2]
Just looking at your history
You're like the girl from Misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
Shorty kind of crazy but it turn me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it’s some things she don't need to know
She never let it go
Ok, ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Ok, ok, ok
You will never stop it now
You need to drop it now
Drop it, drop it

[Hook]
Cause I don't want no Robocop
You move is like a Robocop
When did you become a Robocop
Somebody please make her stop
Make her stop, stop…
Somebody make her stop, stop…
And we won’t stop
I go by the name of – Kanye, West
We’re gonna run through some of the new songs and some of the old songs
And tell you where the whole thing went wrong, and tell you were the whole thing went wrong that forced me to write these songs
That spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl
That spoiled little LA girl, you just an LA girl

Oh you're kidding me
You must be joking
Or you are smoking
Oh oh you're kidding me
Oh you're kidding me
Haha that was a good one
Your first good one in a while
Your first good one in a while
You need to stop it now
Go ahead and stop it now
You need to stop it now
