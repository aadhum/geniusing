Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take this one for the team
You know what? I figured out I'm not a nice guy
I shook hands, kissed babies, gave it a nice try
You know what? I hate pictures of other people's kids
I hate plastic couches in other people's cribs
I hate when other people's cribs smell like shit
I hate when I leave and smell like the crib
What's the cause of the poor smell?
She said "I just cleaned up"
Baby I can't tell
Why every ghetto bitch gotta smell like Love Spell?
Or that god damn cucumber Bath and Body Works
I can still smell the sweat the shit hardly works
What about Cool Water? That shit probably worse
This here a classic like the Lodi Dodi verse
And my man probably hollered at the hottie first
I score, he took the charge
Oooh, that shit gotta hurt
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take this one for the team
If the cops ask, that's my gun
That's my weed, anything you need
I'm a take, I'm a take, I'm a take this one for the team
One fat ass, one flat ass
Nigga hit the switcheroo on my black ass
Ever seen Joe's Jeans on a jackass?
And my bitch got on tights with a tack ass
I'm a fly nigga, and I carry on
With them bottles of that Ros√© and Perignon
Double date, don't cooperate, kill switch
Fuck me and my man, you a real bitch
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take this one for the team
Boy I know you the one that I heard about
I know you working with it through word of mouth
Looks like I'm a have to test you in and out
It's a dirty job but sometimes you gotta
Take it for the team
Playing with her kitty made her come in the car
She a redbone but her cousin is dark
A little out of shape but she'll fuck in the dark
Until she start complaining about her feet hurt
I'm trying to fuck she talking about she want to eat first
Trying to get her back to the nest so I could sting her
So I hit Big Sean on the ringer
Said, "I got a chick for you that look like a singer"
On a scale of one to ten she's a fifteener
You should've seen a nigga's face when he seen her
He said the bitch wasn't pretty enough to finger
On my team she would be a fifth stringer
I said I got the fine one in the Beamer
I'm the point guard and I need a winger
Doing my thing, pocket full of green
Your girl a queen, my girl a thing
You know what though, I'ma take this one for the team
[Verse 4: Kanye West]
It's the nigga they love to hate
But all the bad model bitches they love to date
You need to check my swag and get up to date
Check, check my swag and get up to date
We in the bathroom now, she get her back blew out
She can't clean but I bet she got a vacuum mouth
Her pen busted, goddamn, who brought the raccoon out?
For the team
[Outro: Kanye West]
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
I go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
Go for, I got to
Like we always do at this time
Like we always do at this time
South side, we gonna set this party off right
This time
This time
