[Hook: Kanye West]
Hey Mama, ahhhhhhhhhh, I wanna scream so loud for you
Cause I'm so proud of you, let me tell you what I'm about to do (hey Mama)
I know I act a fool, but I promise you I'm going back to school
I appreciate what you allowed for me, and I, I just want you to be proud of me (hey Mama)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna tell the whole world about a friend of mine
This little light of mine, I'm feelin' let it shine
I'm feelin' take y'all back to them better times
I'm feelin' talk about my mama if y'all don't mind (hey Mama)
I was three years old when you and I move to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fix me up something that was good for my soul
Famous home chicken soup, can I have another bowl (hey Mama)
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I can keep on my bike
And you would give me anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and the glove, but didn't give me a curl (hey Mama)
And you never put no man over me, and I LOVE you for that Mommy can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
Cause a nigga cheatin', tellin' you lies, then I started to cry (hey Mama)
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said, "Mommy, I'ma love you 'til you don't HURT no more!"
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta WORK no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford (hey Mama)
See your unbreakable, unmistakable, highly capable, lady that's making loot
A living legend too, just look at what Heaven do, sent us an angel, and I thank you
The sun rises, the sun sets & goes away
"How this day went so fast?" is what I thought
Only 12 months in a year - life is short
Before my time is up, you know what I'ma do?
Take this time out to say, "I love you"
