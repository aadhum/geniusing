Disick: Hey, do you like Kanye West?
Cheban: Yeah, he's okay, I guess
D: Well, the early work was a little too hip-hop for me in my taste,
but when Dark Twisted Fantasy came out in 2010, I think he really came into his own, both musically and lyrically
D:
Kanye's been compared to Jesus,
Hitler,
Walt Disney,
and even Steve Jobs
C: Hey Disick
Why do you have copies of Billboard magazine all over the place? Do you have a little dog - a little chow or something? *laughs*
C: Is that a raincoat?
his most exciting record so far.
It should be obvious by now that "New Slaves" is the undisputed masterpiece of Yeezus.
A song so catchy, most people won't even remember the lyrics!
But they should.
D: Try getting the Yeezus album now motherfucker!
