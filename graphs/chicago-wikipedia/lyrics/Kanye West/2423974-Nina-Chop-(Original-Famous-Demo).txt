I feel like Taylor Swift still owe me sex
Why, I made that bitch famous (Swea)
I made that bitch famous (I made her famous)
I feel like Amber Rose still owe me sex (Chiraq)
Why? I made that bitch famous
Not really, but somewhat famous (err, kinda)
Vague
Every bitch in the spot wanna drink my Ragu
And did you know that the country, Switzerland
It was famous for lakes?
And I think I got my ring from there 'cause it's icy like skates
Nigga, icy like hockey
Cold like a dead body, yeah
Nike slave, fit in your place
The world turnin' Black slowly
Where you can call niggas "niggas"
But you better not mention Hitler
So tell me who run the label, where the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
Tell me now, where we get the guns from? Us
US!
I bet that money come around if you stay down
I swear, I just came from Europe, my money colored like a clown
Nigga play with keys, Swizz Beatz
Still Michael Jackson after all these leaks (what?)
Yeah bitch you're still Dirty Diana to me (woo!)
Came up out a hot boy, fuck a baller blocker
Bitches makin' lots of noise like Griselda Blanco
Lick the molly off my hand
Got fish filet but we don't fry these
