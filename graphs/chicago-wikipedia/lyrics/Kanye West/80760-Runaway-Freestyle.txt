Runaway, did I make you runaway? Did I make you runaway?
How many people came with the one they love tonight?
Especially when people in your business like the way they do Yeezy
can make ... tonight
Don't listen to me baby cause I'm an asshole
And you always find, and you always find
If I told you I can make the way to heaven tonight
And you always find, yeah you always find
Don't listen to me cause I'm an asshole
I thought you'd always be mine and if I say I didn't love you, I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying
I swear to God I was lying, I swear to God I was lying
