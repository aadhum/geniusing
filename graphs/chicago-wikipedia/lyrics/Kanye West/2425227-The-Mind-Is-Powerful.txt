[Intro: Fats Gonder]
So now ladies and gentlemen this is star time
Are you ready for star time?
Pulling up in something looking foreign
Remember when a nigga couldn't afford shit
And if you're out in the crowd
Don't you play no
So I got the Marvin Williams with him now
And when I die they build statues
You niggas ain't got the cashews
From the city where cash rules
Till they run up on a bad mood
Bitch get out the way
