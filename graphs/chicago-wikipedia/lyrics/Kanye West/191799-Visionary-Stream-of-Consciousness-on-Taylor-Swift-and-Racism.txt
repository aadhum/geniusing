It ain't no love. What the fuck was Pink performing? Don't nobody know that song. Pink performed twice! Two songs?
How the fuck Pink perform twice and I didn't even get asked to perform "Heartless." "Heartless" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter!
I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink! They put me in a fuckin' room and projected it
