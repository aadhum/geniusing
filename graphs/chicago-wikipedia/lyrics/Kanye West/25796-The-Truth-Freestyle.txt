Yo, it's Kanye To The
I did this beat in '96 and ah...
Is it the because my beats the nicest
Got me chargin' niggas Dr. Evil prices
Niggas will sell their soul to go platinum and gold
I'm cold cause I got the gold and kept my soul
Drop an album full of soul
Sold twelve times gold that's six plat
Man that's a sick plaque
Like grabbin' fake titties, I swear I feel the phoniest
Cause I'm from a city where you never know who your homies is
Cause everybody wants your spot
No I.D. told me this
Oh I seen homies get
Shysty on me quick
Wooooh, just imagine if I only spit?
But I do beats too, that's the American dream
Stack two, make sure my shorties inherit some things
A couple real estate investments
Got niggas sayin', "There's the Kennedys"
But oh yes it's, the Wests
Brand new Roc-A-Fella most fresh to death is
Definitely Kanye, peace to Sportie L.A
That keep my shoe game
Plus keep my closet cooped up like a slave ship
How you gon' look at me and say I ain't made shit?
Just look at my outfit, I got all the basics
Air Force, check
Rolex, check
Call Gee and Hop, did you get the, check?
Roc-a-Fella piece, check
Don't forget the neck
Last 9/11 I was poor on the ave
Till I pluraled my math
Now it's Porsche 911 and I'm floorin' the gas
Got a lot of problems, money's one that I not have
Date ballplayer's wives, that divorce and got half
Only book I ever read I could have wrote
48 Laws Of Power
Seems like I got more brain off my fake chain than my real one
Cause on the real son
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuckin' smoke
If you paid, then she's thinkin' bout her children
Feel him? probably not though, unless you got dough
You know what I mean?
You will think the grass greener when you finally get green
I told Gina, you ain't been in a Medina
Yeah, I seen you grabbin' on my balls like Serena
