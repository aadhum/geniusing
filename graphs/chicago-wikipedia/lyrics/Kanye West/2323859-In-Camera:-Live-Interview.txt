Yeah, I think there's people who understand. They see it. That's the same people who see an earthquake coming on, or see a tsunami coming.
I think there’s people who don’t want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class, or snobbery, or whatever comments they have, to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due, or just opportunity as a form of discrimination.
