Well the song says no one man should have all that power right?
There’s definitively been times I let
Let power, get the best of me…
And let the world take the rest of me
I look in the mirror and say
“God, is this, is this my destiny?
Is this what I’ve done
After all the years of you blessin’ me?”
To keep me at bay
Like the Chesapeake
C.I.,
dolo
