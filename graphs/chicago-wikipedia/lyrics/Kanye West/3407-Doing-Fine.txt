Spit it to you, say little West the little beast
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East, peace
Peace, couldn't afford the S-Class so I had to cop the baby mama Benz
Jeep
had a girl nicknamed Sprewell
'Cause when I try to stop, she still made me spin
And get that cash money like Baby and Slim
Pull up in something tinted
so tinted she squinted
She said, "This car real old," I told her her it was vintage
And I need to hit the health club and get a girl that's
Into the fitness, tryna get into the business
Make her open wide like she made me her dentist
And let me get inside
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"
To make the Middle West blow like the Middle East
peace
What I gotta win five Grammys before you finally let me play Alicia's Keys?
If I can't bone, I'll get a clone
Get her there, got her there, grab her hair
She bobbing, don't stop her there
Told me that she love the Roc so much
She drove all the way to Far Rockaway for Roc-a-wear
More popular, cause I abracadabra my Nissan
To a car throwing a peace sign
peace
Damn, that's like the same line I used in the first verse
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wait, it gets worse
I told her S-U-C-K before we F-U-C-K
I give a F-U-C-K if your nephew see K
And if CL like U-C-K,
that's how you know chickens C-L-U-C-K
I'm tryna find a crazy female with a cutie face
A big pimper on the DL, like UGK
Who claim, "I gotta go to work tomorrow, but tonight's the night
So pour another glass of that good stuff
A couple more shots and I'll be doing fine"
