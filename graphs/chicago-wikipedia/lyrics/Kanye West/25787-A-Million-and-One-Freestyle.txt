I freestyle battle niggas for (a million)
How many niggas bit the soul? 'Bout (a million)
How many hoes did I bone? 'Bout (a million)
There's (a million) ways to die, choose one
(A million)
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Lot of people askin' 'bout the money I made,
How are they for real, is them niggas really paid?
Is it true he won't send a beat tape until he get a check?
Neptunes,
check
By check if "H to the Izzo" is the only single that went gold?
If Roc-a-Fella shit fold and you move back to the 'Go
Is it back to ghost producer for D. Dot on the low?
Questions like Toni Braxton,
harassing me
Like you don't care about my son's feelings?
Can I get a minute, you wack bitch? I ain't gotta jack shit
You heard "Takeover", who running this rap shit?
Ugh, fake tits,
Can't we all just get along,
spread love like Take 6?
Bring guns to the arraignment
While the judge in the chamber
Let one up out the chamber, BLAOW!
'04, College Dropout, I make the game different
I don't know what the hell y'all niggas been sniffin'
'Ye still flicking,
Five days out the week, you'll find me in the kitchen
'Cause these beats change the game and the hook's right too
Cats back in the Chi was buying tracks for dirt cheap
Man, what could I do?
Knowing I supposed to style, I'm the fly boy poster child
'Bout to be on Oprah now
Just to make it hot
booming like Master Aces
"Stand Up", number one, and there's more to come
All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
Fred, Barney Rubble
Not a damn thing, nigga, we doing our damn thing,
