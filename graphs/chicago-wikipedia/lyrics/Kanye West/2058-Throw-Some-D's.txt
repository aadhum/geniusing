This the remix
I mean, I ain't really into rims and all that
If I'mma take, five, ten stacks of some D's
it's gonna be some different kind of D's
Kanye's got stacks, ya'll already know that
Louis
Gucci this,
Throw some D's on that bitch
Just got a stripper chick
(Throw some D's on that bitch!)
Something feel different
Cute little college chick, lining up a scholarship
Just got a school grant, spent that on some new tits
Get you a cute chick, face got potential
Working with her little hips, waist like a pencil
Says she love Beyonce, let me upgrade you
Spanish chick grab my chain, says "is that Jesus?"
If I'm unfaithful, blame it on the Grey Goose
All my friends says implants is a selfish gift
She ain't pregnant but about to have twins
Now, is it real love, I need to ask Cupid
She real smart but her ass stupid
And she gon' finish school and get all type of degrees
But I bet she never had them D's
Man, that's a prerequisite
Melrose
She ain't no hoodrat, she ain't gotta prove that
I peep the McCartney's,
Stella got her groove back
Hold on, lemme ask you, why you spend your money on that shallow shit?
Why don't you buy some bigger tits?
Something that'll last you
Halle
But I'mma let you know soon as I get a chance to feel
I don't need no hands to know Lindsay Lohan
She on the same program as Britney, is you wit' me?
That's why I respect Alicia Keys
She say fuck getting them D's
I'mma just ride out with these
