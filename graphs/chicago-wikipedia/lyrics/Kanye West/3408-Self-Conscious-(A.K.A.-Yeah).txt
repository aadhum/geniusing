I know you're wondering
How is Kanye spittin so hot?
Cuz I listen to the ROC
And I listen and watch
And the first thing I copped was a glistening watch
Off that Blueprint money
Yeah I know I'm a dummy
But what I am supposed to tell a girl in the club, why that ass is getting feeled on
If a girl think you broke, she just wanna fuck and smoke
If you paid then she's thinking 'bout her children
Feel him?
Prolly not though unless you got dough
You know what I mean
You would think the grass green when you finally get green
[Verse 2]
Man I promise, she's so self conscious
She has no idea what she's doing in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents will look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurrre
The concept of school seems so securrre
Sophmore three yearrrs ain't picked a careerrr
She like fuck it, I'll just stay down herre and do hair
Cause that's enough money to buy her a few pairs of new Airs
Cause her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car so she named her daughter Alexis
She had hair so long that it looked like weave
Then she cut it all off now she look like Eve
And she be dealing with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail and
Man I promise, I'm so self conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollies and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothing, pass that versace!
Then I spent 400 bucks on this
Just to be like, "Nigga you ain't up on this!"
And I refuse go to the grocery store
Without some ones thats clean and a shirt with a team
It seems we living the american dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss cause they degrade us
We trying to buy back our 40 acres
And for that paper, look how low we a'stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coope
Wack ass niggas
And uh hating-ass dream killin'-ass niggas
