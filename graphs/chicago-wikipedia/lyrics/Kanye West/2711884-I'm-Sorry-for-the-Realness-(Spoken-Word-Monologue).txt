It was like the moment.
All black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we’ve dealt with out in this town. And this is the moment. ‘You get your night. Go ahead. Chris Rock is going to do it. Bam. Talk about how many times you’ve been blocked from being able to excel.’
I didn’t take it as a joke. It ain’t no joke, as Rakim said. It ain’t no joke.
‘I used to let the mic smoke, now I slam it and make sure it’s broke.’
‘Hip hop started out in the park…’
When I make clothes…
t’s funny because I’ll sit there with Obama and Leo’s talking about the environment and I’m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like, ‘That’s not an important issue.’
