I spit it
I spit it so you could feel it
I'm saying I put my personality into it
These hoes is all the same
They all want a nigga hollering out "money ain't a thing"
'Bout pathetic as a player that lost his game
How a motherfuckin' hoe turn a pimp to a lame
See these sheets is like the street you gotta stay strapped up
Cause that's how these hoes'll get you wrapped up
