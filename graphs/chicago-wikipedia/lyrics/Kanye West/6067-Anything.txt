Lookin' out my loft windows man my dreams became true
Lookin' at the mirror, wondering if it's the same dude
Hop in the car and asked the OnStar where this life goes
Drive Slow
Then errrr, away I go
And the way I flew
I know this is what God put me here to do
But in this excitement
You just might miss
A shorty with a demo like "Hey, you might like this"
And see
He
Remind me of me
Just a year ago
Now he
Tellin' me
I'm his her-ro-oh
I took his CD and asked him what he's lookin' for
He said, "Man, I don't know. Maybe a miracle"
There ain't no way
Your dreams are gone see the light of day
And what's the sense in Cons tippin' strippers named Diamond?
conflicted no different than diamonds
And the Lord is the only one that he can confide in
So I don't know how you think that you could deny Him
I open up the Book and the message is clear
To grab at that fast money just to get out of Queens
To bag up the work that they give out to fiends
But that ain't gonna work if I say what I mean
Cause at the end of the day I'm trying to
Get Out My Dreams
