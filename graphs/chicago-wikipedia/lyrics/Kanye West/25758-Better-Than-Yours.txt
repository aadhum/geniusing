My plaques is better than yours
We can start with the hits on my arm I already got the bomb
Now all I need is my first LP to go gold
I'm Kon the Louis Vuitton Don
Bought my Mom a purse now she Louis Vuitton Mom
Still might throw on a little low arm they want me to stop go on gon
They don't want me to shop and me spending that hard
Oh my God is that a black card
I turned around and replied why yes
But I prefer the term African American Express
La La La La La Off MTV
La La La La La When you gonna go out with Me
Brains Power and Muscle like Dame Puffy and Russell
Your boy back on his hustle
Every stylist want to know where they can get the shirts
But they don't give me my credit that's the shit that hurts
And save they whole deal They wrist is on chill
They house is on hill
You could be Lauryn Hill
When I wanted to rap y'all thought I was just playin
Better step in the name of love
Freed your mind at a cheaper price on the street trying to seek advice
Ha ha we in this bitch
