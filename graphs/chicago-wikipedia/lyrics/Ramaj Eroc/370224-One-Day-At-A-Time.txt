Surreal Gang nigga, TDE
I never been the type to go out & commit murders
I don't wanna lead you on, I don't wanna lead you on
She ain't said a word to me, since I told her I'm movin' on
Damn, I guess being honest is being wrong
I just hope she hears this shoutout on this song, I hope she take it one day at a time
These days kids don't een know who Cosby is
Ima getting old as fuck
I'm bringin' Jazz back, The black Pistol Pete
So every verse I smash, Is a no look pass
I'm jus saiyan what I feel, son Goku
Never judge after cases in which adjourned
