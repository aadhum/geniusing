Baby How Can We Move On, When We Both Refuse To Change
And Every Single Day, Its The Same 'Ol Thang
I've Tried To Run Away, From The Same Ol Pain
But It Ain't Always Umbrellas In The Rain So What Im Sayin'
Girl I Love Youuuuuu
Im Here When You're Ready
Love's Here When You're Ready
I Never Been The Type To Fall In Love
Im Stress Out, Is This What Love Does, Love Does?
If Yes, Then No, I Don't Wanna Fall In That
Its Like I Feel The Warmth Of Yo Body, Vibrations Set Off When We Kiss
The Softness Of Your Lips, I SMH Just Thinkin About It
& Ever Since We Split, My Days Been Feelin' Like Shit
You Text Me, I Text You, You Hit Me Back With An Attitude
Then I Hit You Back On Some Selfish Shit, Then You Text Me Back, Like Im Mad At You
Then Thats When I Wonder Why? Then I Dwell On It, I Dwell On It
So Ima Pack My Bags & Then Leave, Pack My Bags & Then Leave
When The Time Comes & You Hit My Line, You Won't Get An Answer From Me
I'll Be So Far Gone
Baby How Can We Move On, When We Both Refuse To Change
And Every Single Day, Its The Same 'Ol Thang
I've Tried To Run Away, From The Same Ol Pain
But It Ain't Always Umbrellas In The Rain So What Im Sayin'
I Love Youuuuuu (That's what she said)
But You're Runnin' Out Of Time
You Got Me Losing My Mind
Im Losing Control
I Don't Know Where To Go
I Swear Im Losing Control
You Did What I Never Thought You'd Do To Me (You Broke My Heart)
You Did, You Did, You Did, You Did, You Did (You Did, You Did, Yeah)
1 Question, Is This The End Of Us
Cut Off Communication
As Much As I Hate To It
So I Packed My Bags & I Left, I Packed My Bags & Left
I Tried Giving My All, & I Can't Give You Whats Left
I'll Never Understand What Went Wrong, But I Damn Sho Know Whats Best
When You Care More, You Get Less, Im Done With All Of Our Stress,
We Cannot Move On, We Both Refuse To Change
Cause Every Single Day, It Was The Same Ol Thang
I Done Ran Away, From That Same Ol Pain
& I Packed Extra Umbrellas For This Rain, But Still Im Sayin Girl
I Love Youuuuuu (Even aafter all this) I Love Youuuuuuu (I still feel a certain way about you)
"Even after all, all that we been through..."
"It's quite amazing how love's still here.."
"Waitin' on you..yeah"
You Did What I Never Thought You'd Do To Me (You Broke My Heart)
You Did, You Did, You Did, You Did, You Did (You Did, You Did, Yeah)
