I Feel The Same Feeling Since I Was 16
Trapped In The Basement Of All My Sick Dreams
Wrapped In The Hate, In A Deep Battle With Faith
Wondering If Me & Satan Been On The Same Team?
Psshh, Why The Fuck Do I Think Of The Worst?
I See Why My Mama Tried To Force To Church
The Words Of The Preacher Never Seemed To Be
What I Needed
That Forbidden Fruit Of Passion Was Eaten Like
Damn, Now My Words Gets My Point Across
Now They Follow Whichever River I Point Across
Now Exhale
Inhale, Like You Escaped From The Heavens
Roll The Blunt, Light It Up, Hit It Once
Wit My Paper On My Mind
Rappers Is Bullshit Now, Half These Niggas Is Worthless
So Put An End To They Show & Show These Niggas The Curtain
I Told My Granny, Dont Miss Me, Cause When I Return
I Won't Be The Same, Theres So Much More To Learn
Many Directions, & There's More If I Turn
Surreal Gang Til I R.I.P. Nigga
If I Died Why Ask GOD Why Me
So Until He Hit My Line, A Few Times & I Miss It
The Shit Is Cool I Got Caller I.D
Uh Blow The Weed If You Got It
Get Drunk, Drink Until You See Shit If Thats What You Do (x2) Yeah UH !
You Ain't Gotta Smoke Weed If You Dont Wanna
If You The Hottest On Yo Fucking Corner Tell'em Call You Richy Blue
Getting Shot Not The Only Signal To Stop Nigga
I Put My Entire Life In Hip-Hop Nigga
I Ain't 7 Feet Tall, But When We Ball
Play Me One On One I Swear To GOD Im Olajuwon Nigga
Ima Dream
Wit The Same Vision That Michael Had
The Same Vision The Engineer Building The Eiffel Had
Drinking From That Fountain He Found In His Own Drought
Baby You Can Take A Nap At My Place If Its Combed Out
I Laugh At My Metaphors
My Mask Cannot Be Worn Anymore
Im Jim Carey Sometimes I Can Be A Funny Guy
Love Can Make Be Evil So You Won't See Me Affectionant
Surreal Gang
