I just wanna live a life like a Cosby kid
Is that an issue?
If me explaining my wants to you is a pet peeve
Then its no point of me tellin' you what I need
& I don't need you, never did, never will
Baby mama bleeds pain, In her eyes I see blood
But I only see them drip when she's mistreated, her position
As A mistress has her wishing she can be the one
To make him leave who he was married to
Back in 2007
whats the truth
When you hear lies leave the mouth of the reverend
I apologize for speaking in circles
Please be safe & please be in before curfew...hugs & kisses
Exit home, enter real world
Enter feeling real love from A broken girl
Exit side chick, hoes, & nosey women
Enter unwanted niggas being in your business
Since beginning we been pitching ideas
Hoping one will unlock the door to a Surreal Life
And We all wonder what that feel like
So we rely on spitting written confessions of our troubled past
too many hot-headed niggas holding heat
Its best to stay out of beef
Because if best served cold, then I serves no purpose
Its hard to cheat with death, but death love flirting
I'm shooting for orion's belt
remember that ski-mask I mentioned
How would you feel if I used it for the wrong intentions?
I really feel no one would care much if I died today
Damn, Is that bad to think?
Happy nigga but he waits til he gets mad to drink
As he sips every drip he spills his feelings out
He said he rather cry to god than take the sinner's route
I just wanna tell you go girl
