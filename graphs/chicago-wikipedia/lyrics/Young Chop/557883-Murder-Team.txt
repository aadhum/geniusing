L's
I won't be the victim, all my niggas killin'
We gon' turn up on you whoever wit em'
Throw your sets up, please don't forget
We the murder team
Murder team, murder team x2
Free bro and that lil boy got great aim
Roll with us over Twitter and Facetime
Never again nigga pussy don't shoot
He forfeit bro into a nigga, police all on the case
First 48, shorty wait
Shorty jam while I'm talkin' to the state
He get out Imma take him to another state
ATL, NYC, MIA or LA, even the Bay (even the Bay)
Outta all the alphabets I want that K (why)
Chop him down, murder team, not a sound
Police come, I'm not around
I ain't here, I'm outta town
Green, bling, or red whatever, I'm on him
