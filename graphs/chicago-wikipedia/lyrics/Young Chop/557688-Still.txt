And I still got these streets on lock
still don't trust a soul
Still ridin' with my Rolls
Still sendin' shots at cops
that's in my B-I-O
You's a lil' nigga, you can't chill, you gon' squeal
And I still got these streets on lock
Like Jack and Jill I'm still at the top
Like Hank I'm the king of the mothafuckin' hill
These niggas still ain't comparin' to lil'
Still Black Disciple, nigga
And I still got these streets on lock
