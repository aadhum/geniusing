When you suck me up, you gotta suck Chop, lil bitch
We got big ass chops
Now Sosa got big ass chops
It's me and Young Chop
I say all I want is top
You can keep your fucking bottom
She say all she want is Chop
Then I say, "What? You off a molly?"
And he chop a lotta blocks
Bitch, my pockets the size of Chop
I'ma let it bang like Chop
My necklace a lotta chop
This bitch think I want her, I'm in love with the gwop
Know how we rock, boy we got 50's on that block
Lamron 300 shit boy you know how we rock
Only the fam, only the family on that block
Can't trust a soul, so I be moving with that Glock
Can't trust a soul, so I be moving with them shots
And I'll put that bitch on any opp
