Keep the pole on me won't catch me snoozin
Don't know what you did heard about
Bitch niggas we not worried about
Come to where you hang out
And blow yo fucking brains out
King Rell, I'm the man now
Fufu niggas hate on me hard
Got thirty shots in that Glock. I'm on my block
On parole, I can't sip lean, that purple syrup it gotta tempt me
And these old hoes they boring
