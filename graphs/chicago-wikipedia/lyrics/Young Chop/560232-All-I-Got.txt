All I got, all I got
This money and music that's all I got
[Verse 1: Young Chop]
All I got, all I got is them shooters up in the back
All I got, nigga wanna take my chain, that's a wrap
All I got, pop a nigga, young berg, I take it back
All I got, I got this thirty with this beam, ho
I got this 4-5 with extendo
Blow a nigga like Nintendo (Cartridges)
I got the forty with that beam ho
All I got, is some bitches beggin' for top
All I got, my True Religion pocket squad
