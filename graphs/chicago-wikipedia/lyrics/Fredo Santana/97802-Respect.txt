Money, power, respect, that’s all a nigga know
I got junkies at my door, I sell a lot of coke
So much dope, so much coke
Trapping can’t get old
I need a new connect, cause his prices getting high
Threw some bands out at the factory, I’m just trying to get it back
Aye Fredo you know, we getting it in
Split the profit with my mans
