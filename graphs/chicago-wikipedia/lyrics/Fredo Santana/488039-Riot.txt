Rest in peace Blood Money
Rest in peace Lil Rob
Rest in peace Odee
Glo'd up, taking selfies, I'm so selfish
These bitches be so childish, these niggas be some actors
I'm like hold up, hold up, hold up
I don't drink Champagne, shit I'd much rather be sober
I'm so predominantly winning
On all this rap shit, the king of comedy
And writing, and all this acting
This ain't an act though, it's facts yo
Talkin' shit internet to my face, silence
These critics is fuckin' haters, they love to hate yo
But wouldn't say that shit to Fredo cause they afraid yo
He could rap but he shouldn't,
tried to kill him, they couldn't
No one else understood him, he's a joke
Then why your favorite rapper asking me for help?
Oh I swear to God, oh I swear to God
We the realest niggas, ask my fuckin' squad
My money talk, you silent
My weed loud, you silent
My Tesla engine is silent
And you soft, more than college, oh
Slidin' in your top five, let 'em hate on that line
