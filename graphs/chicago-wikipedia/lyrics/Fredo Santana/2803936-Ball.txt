Ball on these niggas mane like there's no tomorrow
Got a couple bad bitches on me, I don't even call
Call my choppa Queen Latifah cause I'm 'bout to set it off
Real trap nigga man, I done sold it all
Marble floors, no beat down roaches on my wall
Remember going to school broke with holes in my drawers
Now I got 'em Gucci drawers with a 1000 bitches to call
Now I'm that nigga man, who would ever thought
Now I'm that nigga man, who would ever thought
Who would ever thought mane who would ever thought
10 bands on your head just to get my shorty's something to do
More like free Money and 'em cause I'ma pull up too
