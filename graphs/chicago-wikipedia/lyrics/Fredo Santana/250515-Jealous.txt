I can't leave the country cause I'm a felon homie
And I don't trust these niggas, they be telling on me
And I don't trust these bitches, they be plotting on me
Everybody ain't real, you gotta watch homie
Niggas say they real, but they acting funny
These niggas changed and got jealous on me
I don't trust these niggas, I don't trust these bitches
Drunk right now, so you know I meant it
If you know me then you know nigga Chi-town like my second home
I done flew a private jet for some Harold's Chicken straight from Rome
I done bust down on a few thots, Fredo hit me on my phone
"Nigga I can't talk right now, got pussy on my tongue"
I got worry on my brain, I been gone all summer
Just to fly back home and found out y'all done killed my little brother
Shit is fucked up on these streets
Why the fuck would I think about some rap beef?
Nigga I got bigger fish to fry now
Empty out my account and I'll pay for sleep
Where's my bottle?
Money change and people change and people come
And people go and act estranged
I'm aggravated cause they hated, confirmation for success
Anticipated, I can taste it
I can chase it back down with liquor
I could drown out my sorrows
But I ain't a sorry ass nigga
Get up off your ass, make yourself a hundred racks
Bitch, get up off your ass, throw it back back back
Back inside my 'Bach, back in a garage that we can jack
Bitch I love my hood, I'm strapped up, what's good?
Coming up, gotta watch who you hang with
I'm still with the same niggas I came with
On the block with the same niggas I banged with
If you ain't talking money I don't know your language
I come from that very very bottom
Now I'm getting money and I'm seeing stardom
My niggas savage, don't start 'em
We up them guns, if it's a fucking problem
Money coming in, don't have money problems
Kicked your bitch out cause she ain't wanna swallow
All these bitches thots, acting like models
Fredo, I'm the king of Chicago
Gotta .30 and I fill it up with hollows
Got bricks and I feel like El Chapo
I'm the shit, I'm the shit, I'm the shit bitch
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch
