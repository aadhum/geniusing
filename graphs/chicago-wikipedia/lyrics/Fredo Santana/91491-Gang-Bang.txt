Hundred shot TEC, I don't need no fucking aim
Every nigga with me throwing up the same thing
Hundred shot TEC, I don't need no fucking aim
All my niggas grimy, all we do is gang bang
Who the fuck is you, you can't hang where I hang
I got shooters thats gon' shoot, bullets going through your brain
I'm three-hundred, so I know she gon', ain't much I gotta say
Middle fingers to the Jake's
Fresh up out of jail, I be on my trap shit
Hit Chop up on the cell, I need a beat I'm on my rap shit
Two thirties in my hand,
