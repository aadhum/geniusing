I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
All my niggas savage up, you don't want war with us
fuck boy get yo trap up
I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
Promethazine and codeine got me drinking all this pain away
I ain't worried about the next nigga
Bricks came in, got a young nigga flexin'
Flexin' so hard got me feeling like a wrestler
Heard you want some lean, then you know I'm finna tax you
Asking dumb questions, what you want to get slapped or something?
I ain't worried about what you said, just pass me the double cup
