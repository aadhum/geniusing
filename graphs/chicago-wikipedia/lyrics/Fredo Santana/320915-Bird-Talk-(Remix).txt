[Hook: Fredo Santana]
You want a wrist like this
You gotta bird talk

Expensive kicks like this
You gotta bird talk

Drive whips like this
You gotta bird talk
You gotta bird talk
You gotta bird talk
You want a bitch like this
You gotta bird talk

[Interlude: Paul Engemann]
Push it to the limit
Walk along the razor's edge
But don't look down, just keep your head
And you'll be finished
Hit the wheel and double the stakes
[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Bird talking with them pigeons, make them bitches fly to you
Looking like the police, I'mma have to lie you
Run up on me wrong. boy, you don't wanna die do you?
Them shooters at your head, and they killin' everybody that's riding with you
Gino got the pistol and we solving all these issues
In the field we play with missiles and these niggas soft as tissue
Savage squad records man this the new world order
And we kidnap your daughter catch a case I call my lawyer
Call up Pablo and place my fucking order
Every-things good as long as he get em cross the border
40 for a whole and them halves for a quarter
40 for a whole and them halves for a quarter
Last week I met a plug in Minnesota
All white foreign whips same color coca
All white foreign whips same color coca
I know this one fiend she a very mad snorter

I said I buy pussy (I do) and I beat the bitch up (I do)
I'm prayin' for a brick,
Rolls Royce outside, damn, Imma fuck a bitch
Ayy (Basedgod) what it do (woop!)
Aye mane west side, nigga, mane
Damn right I sell dope, damn right I face time
Got a number on my jersey
In the strip club, spendin' all my money
Sell crack, hit licks, just to flex money
Stipper bitch wanna dance, Imma spend money

She's on fire
And she burns through the night at the speed of light
