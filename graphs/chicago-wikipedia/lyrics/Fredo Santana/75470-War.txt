Foo Foo ass niggas, we expose those
Call my hood niggas up about a stain tho
Sit down, plot about it, then we take it down
A lot fans don’t need a guard (uhuh)
And I got a lot a niggas fuck a entourage (yahh)
High as fuck I’m coolin' with the stars (chillin)
Too much money for a war wit' us (yahh)
GBE bitch it’s only us (3hunna)
When it comes to stains we take down niggas
Ki's and pounds nigga hit the ground nigga
Let 30 shots go, call that shit a crowd clearer
Lots a loud innas foreign cars in ‘em
Money over all no ops in this mob nigga
Put money on yo' squad that’s a group a dead niggas
