Beefing with me, shit, you better beef with other niggas
Got my gun, try to rob me, I love shooting niggas
Grab the popcorn ‘cause it can be a movie nigga
Voices in my head like, "Fredo, you the truth nigga!"
Up in my own lane, don’t compare me to fool niggas
Rap don’t work then someone’s jewels missing
That don’t work then, back to the kitchen
Got a thousand hoes but I’m trying to get more bitches
45 on me, nah, I ain’t lacking
