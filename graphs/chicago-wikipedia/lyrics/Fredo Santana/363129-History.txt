In my pocket, dead folks, Nuttin but history
It's all about the Glory man, these bitches ain't shit to me
Pull off in a rari man, I left my top history
Nigga run up on me I'ma leave his ass history
His mama lookin' for him, Man i made left his ass history
I keep it too hood, I'm what you fuck nigga's pretend to be
Sit down class, pay attention, this is history
Young livin' legend, Man I'm givin' out history
In my pocket, dead folks, Nuttin but history
I don't smoke no other weed, all i smoke is OG, I come from oh six one
It's all about the Glory man, these bitches ain't shit to me
Pull off in a rari man, I left my top history
Nigga run up on me I'ma leave his ass history
His mama lookin' for him, Man i made left his ass history
I keep it too hood, I'm what you fuck nigga's pretend to be
Sit down class, pay attention, this is history
Young livin' legend, Man I'm givin' out history
In my pocket, dead folks, Nuttin but history
