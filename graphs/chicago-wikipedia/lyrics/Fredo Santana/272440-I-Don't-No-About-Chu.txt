I come from the streets, that's why street niggas feel me
And I know I did a lot to make niggas wanna kill me
If I told you what I did I know you won't believe me
Growing up in the Chi man I swear ain't wasn't easy
I speak real street shit, real street shit from the heart
I done came a long way from selling nickels out the lot
I done sold a lot of cocaine at my back door
How many times the police kick my shit, about four
I done did a lot of dirt, I done sold a lot of work
Just to take the pain away I just pour another four
N'other four, I just pour another four
Just to take the pain away I just pour another four
