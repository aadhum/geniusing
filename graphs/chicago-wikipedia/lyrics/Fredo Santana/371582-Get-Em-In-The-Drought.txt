I’m still selling cocaine in the drought (cocaine)
Whipping birds and I get ‘em from the south
I-95 hot, need another route
That bitch wanna pick she just need some clout
Police hit my spot need another house (the fuck)
Get them birds coming in and they coming out
When it’s a drought, my niggas tote 30s when it’s a drought
And nigga wanna play monkey, ain't feed him bananas I feed him straps
He 'bout to drop me 8 I only gotta pay for 3 (love)
Get them birds coming in and they coming out (birds)
