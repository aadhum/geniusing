Go all the way back when I was a young nigga
Got my first pack, fell in love with drug dealin'
New jewelry, new kicks, what them licks did
M.O.B., fuck a bitch, I put the block first
In the trap, fuck a job, that's where I work
And this bezel on my wrist, it makes my arms hurt
No conversation, I got this 30 I'mma spark first
50 shots in them choppers
