I used to sell dimes on the third floor
Now I got bricks by the boat load
I used to sell work by the corner store
Now I got crack like it's '86
The world is mine, I'm looking like Tony son
El Chapo with the work, I'm mister double up
Vatos hit me up, he need a hundred of 'em
I used to sell dimes on the third floor
Now I got bricks by the boat load
I used to sell work by the corner store
Now I got crack like it's '86
They asking about me all in Tijuana
I used to sell dimes on the third floor
Now I got bricks by the boat load
I used to sell work by the corner store
Now I got crack like it's '86
