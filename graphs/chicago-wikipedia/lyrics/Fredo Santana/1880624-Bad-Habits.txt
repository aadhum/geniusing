Pourin' lean up like it's water
All I hang around is killas, I got bad habits
A-R 15
Couple bricks up in my mattress
Police snatch me up, man, I ain't doin' no speakin
[?] , boy I swear them niggas beezy
Pourin' lean up like it's water
All I hang around is killas, I got bad habits
Don't run up on this car right here, man, it could get tragic
Pourin' lean up like it's water
All I hang around is killas, I got bad habits
Holiday season, aye
