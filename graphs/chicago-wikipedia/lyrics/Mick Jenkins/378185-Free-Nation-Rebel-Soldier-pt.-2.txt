I promise you the waters is coming
Saying it everyday got me feeling like Noah
They say I'll blow up
My aunts and uncles see me rapping
They say I'll grow up
Some stop and stare  like how he still a vegetarian wit all this good meat that he throw up?
Trust ima Show up when it's show time
Running threw the field like dion sannders wit four primes
We need mo primes
Where the fuck is megatron when you fighting lions?
Tellem whatever they selling nigga I ain't buying!
The world been coming to an end and I ain't need no Mayan calendar to feel that
Got the people rooting for the waters like Phil back wit a younger Kobe
Young shin obi
Nigga moving through the shadows of the city
got no hittaz but the youngins know me
It was always bout the growth and development
Never to big
Elephant in the room how could you not notice?!
Can't you smell when I'm cooking this rock?!
Dwayne Johnson with the raw
Ain't tryna live life to BIG it might stop
Stay Ready to die am I PAC?!
Holograms of the southside
I be blessed just to make it back to my spot!
Steppin over squares like hopscotch I'm top notch
Got hands like doc OC
It's a wonder that he dont write more
More fire for the water to be boiled get impurities out
I'm here to cure any doubt that you may have had bout the kid in the leather boots
Tommy bag full of Cole/coal and you know what pressure do
A flawed diamond still impeccable
Why the simple shit on the cover of complex?
