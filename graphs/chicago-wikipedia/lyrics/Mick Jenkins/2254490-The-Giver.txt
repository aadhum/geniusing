[Chorus]
Girl it's nice to meet ya
I really like yo’ style
Westside mamacita
The sunshine in yo’ smile
And I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me
[Hey]
Give it to me, give it to me
[Hey]
Give it to me, give it to me
[Huh]
Give it to me, give it to me
I’m tryna build, I'm not a mason but
I’m thinkin’ blueprints when I face the joint
She tastin’ truth thats what I laced her blunt with
You don’t gotta hit the weed just make sure you bring your smile
And that seed, I got water
We connect and it grow
[Chorus]
Girl its nice to meet ya
I really like yo’ style
Westside mamacita
The sunshine in yo’ smile
And I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me
[Hey]
Give it to me, give it to me
[Hey]
Give it to me, give it to me
[Huh]
Give it to me, give it to me
[Bridge]
Know somewhere that we can go
If you down then let me know
On my way right now
On my way

[Bridge]
Know somewhere that we can go
If you down then let me know
On my way right now
On my way
On my way right now
[Oooh]
Like it was your yo last
Like you seem about to die
It was like I saw the future when I looked into your eyes
And I just want you to
[Oooh]
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
I just want you to
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me
