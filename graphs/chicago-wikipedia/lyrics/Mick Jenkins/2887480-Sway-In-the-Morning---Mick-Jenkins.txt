No dibs on doobies, bout to get lit by my dolo
White Grape White Owl was my first love, I can't go no more though
I be the token
Black guy in the room full of people screaming "nigga" with me
Now am I wrong if that's sitting with me
And all this water got me feeling Misty, we making mad noise
Tell them flamethrowers I be Blastoise in your city
I'm lightyears ahead of the buzz y'all toyin' with
Cowboyin' wit
Makin' points I can't be much more poignant with...shit
