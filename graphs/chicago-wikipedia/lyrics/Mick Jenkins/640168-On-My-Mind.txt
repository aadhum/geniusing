Tell 'em that i'm straight up out the Chi, and i'm reppin' that, to the def
Gotta couple homies that'll second that, reckin' rap
OG Skywalker like Luke
I been one with the force so I ain't never had to force it
Tommy Hilfiger, fuck them horses
Stuntin' on these niggas somethin' I don't be endorsin'
You don't really gotta brag if you got the bigger portion, fool
Trynna cop a bigger morsel of this pie called life
Like a 5 star dinner with a dash of Allspice
Niggas salty cause the system has been built on faulty premises
