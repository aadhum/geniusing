You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, yeah
We could take our time, or, you can take your time
I mean, I know what I want
Hella respect your disposition, you open my mind
It really makes me no difference if you don't open your legs
More interested in introspective conversation instead
Been ahead, of most niggas my age for quite some time now
If ever in distress I'll peep yo' S.O.S like batcalls
No smoke in mirrors you ain't even gotta hit the backwood
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, at all, at all
Lady I ain't pressed for time
At all, at all, at all
Girl I got your back and I ain't into fronting so I'm pennin' something so you know that I ain't thinkin' with assumptions at all
this shit might take a while
I mean this might take some time, I mean you might need some time
I mean- I mean I know what I want
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind (hol'up)
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, yeah
We could take our time, or, you can take your time
I mean, I know what I want
You was on my mind
You had crossed my mind
Holla at me Jill
Lady I ain't pressed for time, at all, at all, at all
Lady I ain't pressed for time
At all, at all, at all

H- h- y- y- y- y- you can take your ti- time

Holla at me Jill
