I only do it if (I want to)
Look in the mirror, do I (want you)?
I don't know. Do you know?
Whether I'm checking my watch or I'm hitting my dab
You use the same muscles to cough with as you would do to laugh
Man y'all don't hear me, if you've never been alone how you know yourself?
You should love you so much that you go Marylin Manson and blow yourself
It's some things that you gotta learn that only you can show yourself
Getting introspective, it can only go right like you ain't got no left
Like a wack-ass point guard
Or a porn star, yeah I'm going hard
Young Coinstar
I've done seen change, trying to turn this shit to dollar bills
Touching souls, not just copping feels
(I am, um) I am absolutely, positively happy
Exponential, gratitude for rapping
Only God and a blunt could help me
And Noname quit the weed
A good rap song is all I need
[Outro: Mick Jenkins]
