Put that in your pipe and smoke it
Then tell me what you see when you inhale
Big box that will never be open
How the fuck you got pops that don't show up
When his kids just wanna hang like a pigtail
You gon' always get props when you blow up
All your nigga get the Range with the big wheels
Little nigga put the hand on the big steel
Couple strays make the hope start to fade away
Best day i had
I had copped me a quarter
Dont ride around with that shit in your impalas
If you let them off the chain like Django
You gonna have some nigga lookin for tapanga
That ain't marijuanna that you tastin
I just let them hit the truth
I just let them hit the truth
Read between the paradox
The skinny jeans and pair of Docks
I know I love the Martens too
