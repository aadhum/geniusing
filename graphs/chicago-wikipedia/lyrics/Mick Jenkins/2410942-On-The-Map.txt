She lives in North Dakota
She lives in my lap
She hit me from her Motorolla
I told her face-time me on your iMac
I want to be her nigga
Cause she's always in Tommy Hilfiger
She know my passport got the stamps
Stamps like I'm an envelope nigga
She lives in Arizona
I told her drink more water (sip)
She lives outside the matrix
I told her I'm a martyr
She like me cause my third eye open
Said she want the world
Didn't know how to get it
So I asked her
Where she want to go
