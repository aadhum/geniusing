Cause you never met another nigga quite like me
A southside nigga way too Free
A groovy nigga that's way too G
In the cut, twisting lemon kush and jasmine
Lemon verbena candles burn slow
Watch the verbs flow
I spit that fire they can feel it in the third row
He shoot deep, heroine, Larry Bird flow
They got your silver spoon heated
Over here, it's ginger ale for your hoes
I don't want they souls
Spit it full of solder, they speaking that tight, too
Fuck with my famo
