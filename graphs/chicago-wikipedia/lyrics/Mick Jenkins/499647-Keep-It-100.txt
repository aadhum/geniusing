check the style, I can spit a couple clotheslines
Hang em out to dry,
Talk green with the PGA
Spark a stogey, I’m so up to par
So up to par, these niggas bogey
Fuck a cop if he crooked, fuck a coward if he busting
Imma teach my niggas justice like it’s John Jay
Ain’t no honor for the meek,
ain’t no power in your speech
Either say it with your chest or get it concaved
