Yeah, chilled evenings and cold Fanta
I would take that over vodka and pole dancers
Niggas ask why I just give a cold answer
This is life without the flash like an old camera
Cause popping bottles like a fad now
So I pass on the glass bring the grass around
I've just been trying to chill all day
I've just been waiting to get a feel all day
Of what it would be like to live this day
As if this day could be my last
Damn
I shouldn't be doing this
Kind of apprehensive still
I so fucking new to this
People say I got a chance
I know there's some truth to it
Cause the free is hotter than sleep
In 90 degree weather with no AC a blanket and three shirts
Long sleeve right next to a heater
