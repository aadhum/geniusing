[Intro]
But now love is so much better
And Lord knows if my words don't come together
Just listen to the melody
Cause my love is in there

[Hook]
Just listen to the melody (x3)
Baby
A nigga feel like going in
Feel like letting out the bullshit I've been holding in
Music, school and money, on what should I be focusing
The jeopardy of choosing the wrong door and opening
Fuck it, take the music for a thousand, Alex
I'm tryna dress it right, I'm talking thousand island
I'm aiming for the pocket, I'm like a thousand linemen
I'm in the barbershop searching for the silver lining
Can someone tell me how much good will really come from this?
Is all that company gonna leave a nigga comfortless?
I could have the white moving quicker than an avalanche
I'm looking round like maybe I shouldn't be here
Fuck it I'll just stay and I'll have me a little feast here
And for dessert can somebody bring me a chocolate eclair
Those are one of my favorites, I'm eating until I make it
Niggas gassed like I'm driving two cars in here
And even if they don't feel it, they felt the need to lie
Trying to eat, fucking starving artist here
