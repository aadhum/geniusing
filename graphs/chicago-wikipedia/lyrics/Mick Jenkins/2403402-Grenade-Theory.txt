Chicago
Chicago
Chicago
The streets of Chicago
They are waging war on the streets of Chicago
We be, raw with it from the veggies to the truth
'Bout the flakes, and the snakes, and the people that just cannot pump the brakes
Ye told me "drive slow"
there's been a flood in the attic
It's made it's way from the basement
Do it all for less than pennies, I will
Why so many do it for the gold?
Why so many fold like a crease
Why I can't play around with the wordplay?
