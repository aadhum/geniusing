Marijuana rollin'
Keep them bottles comin', models comin'
Take a seat, be fake with me cause they know I got dollas comin'
This is what it takes to be happy?
Please...
Don't let them bleed yo' mind
My nigga just free yo' mind
I hope you can see it nigga, been prayin' for peace/piece of mind
Chiefin' on leafy greens and thinkin' just like LeBron
The 4th quarter's up on us, i'm hopin' we finish strong
The quotes is what's really potent, the focus is on what's wrong
The message is in yo' mind, i'm hopin' you sing along
I know you gone listen close, I just hope that you see the prob
Calypso it be the bomb, tell 'em about it Mick
