I mean, we all had to fall on our shit before
I know y'all niggas was late on your rent before
Ran into a couple Harvey Dents before
Fuckin' with the children of the indigo
Free ain't what cheap i
I see kids talking work with empty briefcase
We put the beef under rugs and call that sweepstakes
Then roll a joint like a nigga need a knee brace
Karl Anthony Towns and Carl Thomas the sounds
Summer rain water color paints all over town
Oliver Twist, the artful dodger's all over this
If she with me, then don't call her my bitch
I'm in the VIP, with a big bottled water and I'm sparkin' the piff
Food for thought, I ain't paying the chef
With cleft lips on the bass clef
Singin' with strep, I'm sick with it
On one knee like Tim with it
Message gettin' clear as the piss
I mean, we all had to fall on our shit before
I know y'all niggas was late on your rent before
Ran into a couple Harvey Dents before
Fuckin' with the children of the indigo
Bring the cash in manila envelopes
I mean, we all had to fall on our shit before
Know y'all niggas was late on your rent before
Ran into a couple Harvey Dents before
Fuckin' with the children of the indigo
Told you once, I told you twice
Never was in it for the Oberweiss alone
Mercy mercy, me, that Murciélago
That 7 hundred-dollar jacket purchased from Barney's
Ain't hurtin' my pockets, but fuck, what do I know?
I'm really just a southside nigga with a Nas flow
Never been as passive as Rondo, I mean, a
Condo on my wrist has never really been a goal of mine
Less “Goldie,” more Dolemite
You wanna understand my truth
Then just comb through my statements
Just comb through my statements, statements
‘Til it's Roger Roger
Renaissance Man
You wanna understand my truth
Then just comb through my statements
Just comb through my statements, statements
'Til it's Roger Roger
