With THEMPeoples moving a piano
Choppin’ all these bars, trappin’ out the bando
Money bag, money bag
Patient, breakin’ profits with my kin-folk
Plus I been payin’ tithes, I need that ten-fold
I’m still on this ten-speed, touching these tempos
Eatin’ this tempeh
I feel like Dikembe, I never been dunked on
Chip on my shoulder, this queso is not comin’ in by the case-load
We was rippin’ samples by the crate-load
