[Intro]
Young, nigga, been sick for a minute
How come you still lost?
What you ain't noticed the cough?
What you ain't noticed the sneeze?
Bet that you noticed the steeze
Stupendous troubles I wrote
Waterfalls up through my nose
sweetie I got these loafers on
I don' already told you I don't need your two cents nigga'
Ain't you heard?
Theres dollars in yo pocket if you ride with the freaks
Theres choppers in the pockets o' these lil niggers ridin through the streets
Like big boy, so fresh and so clean
They gon' be stretchin yo dreams
All cause you flexin yo cream
Blood is the sweat of the streets
Even with sugar it's never that sweet
You gon fuck around and need a condom for yo heart
Cause these niggas don't love
White tee look like Derrick Rose's jersey
Ol' grille look like ol' dirty
Enter the wu, from 35th up, you gotta enter the zoo
And they fuckin' up my tommy hilfiger shirt
Cos they fuck with the sentence and feel niggas first
And it hurts
Whether Lincolns or Limos they still see a Hearse
Black whip creeping on a black boy reaching in his backpack nigga grabbed a black mac made him do a backflip head on the backboard
