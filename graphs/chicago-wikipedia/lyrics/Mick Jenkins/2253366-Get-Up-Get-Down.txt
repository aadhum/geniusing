Came in this bitch with intentions to black out
The audience all white, I thought we been blacks out
See thirty five show tour and I almost backed out a year ago
Back in my bag, back in the days, a young nigga trapped out the pad
Couple of ounces, no, It wasn't too bad, cup full of water, I be missin' my dad
That's on my kidneys, my piss soo much clearer
Down to the letter, you can't offend me, it's February
We didn't come for Gold Line, from that southside Chicago, I got that
I can't go, ma, I'm still underground, pay attention, that's a gold mine
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, nigga
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up, get out, get down
Get up...
