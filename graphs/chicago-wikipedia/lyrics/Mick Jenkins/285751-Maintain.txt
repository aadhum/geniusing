Would you fuck with me, if I gang bang
Niggas out here throwing hand signs
We just out here tryna' maintain
Do it for the free so the passion is thicker
South side flow but the fashion is Wicker
Wake up lets hop on band wagons and fasten your seatbelt
We like barista
This is the mindset
WWF we like Batista, raw
Flex on a nigga if you ever got a problem
I don't know know trig
CPS don't know your kids
We just know maintain
Over they head, call it they Kangol
This is the angle
I guess that's a hat trick
Shit can get messy you best bring your chapstick
Or else it's crackin'
Free nation action
Pivot been out here mackin'
Fuck what you Hewlett packin'
Off the block I'm Ewing Patrick
Niggas jump wave like cruise ship captains
Too distracted
I be like fuck you on it's Mick Jenkins ho
Cup of ginger ale and a peanut butter loafer
Motherfuckers betta' get a coasta'
Turn into a Harpo
Motherfuckers better get an Oprah
Don't talk to me about no diploma
Tell me why niggas on cornas'
Middle finger to the badge
Like these niggas can't hold us
These niggas can't hold us back these niggas can't hold us no
I was just sitting with Frsh
