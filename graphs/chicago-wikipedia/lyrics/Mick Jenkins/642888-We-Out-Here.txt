You know the hater's gone hate
But my homies gone be down to ride, so we out here
You know they always gone hate
But my niggas gone be down to ride, so we out here
(x2)

Fool
I swear to God, I'll be hookin' niggas up
When it's time to leave, got you in that box, hope you box, hope you bob and weave
They done had the nation on lock since the colonies
But i'd rather stand high and die than live on my knees
I told my closest niggas tell those who don't know
Fuck a YOLO
I'm trynna live life in slow-mo
Take a photo
Maybe invest in Acapulco, gold homie
