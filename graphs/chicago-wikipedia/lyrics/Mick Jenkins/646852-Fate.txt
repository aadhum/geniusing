Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
Who knew that shoulders could be this cold
I, told her holler when the pain thaws
I was rolling chemdawg
She was off the menthols
Please, we were not on the same plateau
[Hook]
Face it lady we weren't meant to be
Basically I'm tryna set you free
I know, I know
I told you I won't let you go
I know, I know
Didn't wanna feel like that no more
I know, I know
I just might miss you when you gone
Demons in my shadows
Water in my bladder
Watch the people scatter when the rain falls
How do we breathe under water?
[Outro Skit]
