All these wack niggas at the top about to fall
They call it asbestos
And all these niggas who ain't never want to talk wanna hang
Just call it a necklace, of fake niggas
And you don't really want me to break niggas
Spit a sixteen, every bar hit like a fist
What's that, like eight niggas?
Been trying to fill your shoes, my dawg, my foot is about to start blistering
