Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack cause I'm coming from the back like the heimlich
Maneuver
Rap MacGruber
Don't do no molly but niggas shroomin like Koopa Troopa
And hittin' holly like I was hanging with Mr. Cooper
Just ginger ale for yo hoes I don't want they souls
Like Dennis Rodman in this bitch it's so much going on in my head
He kinda like Robin in this bitch I flip you just might catch the bat That's acrobatic you gasp that's asthmatic what you can't breathe?
You talkin' tough Toucan Sam, don't get to fuckin' wit me
I clip yo wings
Now you fly as penguin
A fuckin' slave, I can still see the rope hanging
Blame your environment or blame your companions
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Burner in the back pack
Don't sleep on them knapsacks, bet you don't see black jack if you do my g
Blow fat sacks wit the crew we be on backporch talking truth probably
The reason most of mine done seen they 84th season
Only blues when niggas bleeding
Free Nation Rebel Soldier never tolerate the treason
Free masons bumping shoulders never contemplate allegiance
Free basing baking soda with the coke it couldn't get this dope it's all 'bout how you whip it
How he sip it wit his pinky in the air this ain't no champagne
They shoot for stardom
I be the Anne Frank
He be high and writin' in verses just like writing books in attics
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga, dont lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
Youngin' tryna be timeless
Don't lack!
Don't, don't, don't lack my nigga don't lack
Don't let me catch you lackin' famo
