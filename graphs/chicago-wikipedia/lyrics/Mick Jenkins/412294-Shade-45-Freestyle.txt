They want it less complicated, I’m never gon’ lose letters
Don’t feel the need to beef it up when I abuse lettuce
Cop the purple or the green when the BB King blues get us
Make it for you niggas, hope that you catch the message
Hope that between the flash and the flare you pause and reflect it
I’m hoping checks get collected like a Nike shoe fetish
I’m shooting for New York Times, right now we newsletters
Not enough paper, way too many issues
Sweat from the grind require way too many tissues
Get a towel in here, F-R, can a nigga get a vowel in here?
Matter fact two E’s, matter fact that’s FREE
