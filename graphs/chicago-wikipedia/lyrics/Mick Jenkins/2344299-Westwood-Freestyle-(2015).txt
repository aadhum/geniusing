I'm from the Southside of Chicago
Deez is my negus
Runaway slaves, please don't act like they freed us
Best watch how you treat us
Caucasian preferably
Oh now he racist again
Bitch, what's the basis? Face basic infringements of rights on the daily
Fuck Mayor Daley
Purified H2O
Some called The Water[s] a storm...that's just the calm
I got [T]he [H]ealing [C]omponent man
I can't bang with a nigga, I don't hang with a nigga
If I don't see that man as a man
Lotta lost boys looking for a Tinkerbell
And that shit bout as real as a flying Peter Pan
