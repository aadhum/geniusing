Peg cuff the denim so the socks showing
Nigga 'bout to
Flood 'em with the flow
I rock those
Loafers as smooth as
Butter with the toast
Fleeting conversations couple niggas getting quaint with queens
Couple sinners with a saints regime
More concerned with the beef
And the salad that make you Caesar
We on the lookout for Brutus
Couldn't pimp us for no silver
I ain't related to Judas
Never kiss and tell
Hope it do like granny saltines and ginger ale nigga
Just like your neck
I'll be like "Nigga, I'm at your crew!
And damn near Manute Bol
When I maneuver through the blocks
I'm talking writers block and 63rd
Niggas got Sachs like Goldman
On that BS like Rodman
Fuck with me famo!
Fuck with me famo!
Fuck with me famo!
Fuck with me famo!
Momma taught me well
Cos we been taught to fail
But we been on the grind
Get a whiff of that coffee smell
Ain't seen the phoenix sun, we barkley still
Get with it in the paint
Gotta have some logic before you start with the pro tools
Since Biggie wrote them 10 coke rules
My spirit been Goku'd
And lyrics just super sayings
We put the pressure on pussies
That's out here flexing they Kegel
We Buick through all the bullshit
No disrespecting my Regal
