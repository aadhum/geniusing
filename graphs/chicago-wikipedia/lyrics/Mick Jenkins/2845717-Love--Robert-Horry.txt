Shots from the corner like I'm Robert Horry
Or Anne Leibovitz you need a bigger name
Or that nigga from City of God, I forget his name
Celebrating 'fore you even win the game, what's the basis?
stepping, switching lanes, it's so easy to forget about the basics
How we pace it on the daily
But it sure is grapes that sun dried, it's raisins in the sun, my eyes is watching God
All I did was finish Trees & Truths and start The Water[s]
And I wrote every single word like a court reporter's attention to detail
I can see the bullshit in all of the retails
Still I copped the Yeezys though, I bought them hoes resale
Grabbed all the clothes that I could like Ezal
see shore with sea shells
I found peace in the heart of the storm
I had to get released 'till inner demons was gone
Then I linked with the Nation and they helped me move on
Now I'm staring directly at the sun 'till my eyes go blind
Nigga never understand, the purpose is so divine
Pictures too intense, make you have to press rewind
Cause everything's microwaved, they don't ever take the time
Free give you what you need, for spirit, body, and mind
If keeping it real is wrong then I be committing crimes
My nigga it's FreeNation, we water turned into wine
Give you photos of my life through these allegory
Lotta niggas talk but they ain't got a story
We out here taking shots from the corner like a young Robert Horry
I don't need to hear the comments for me
If you get the picture you can peep it through whatever frame
