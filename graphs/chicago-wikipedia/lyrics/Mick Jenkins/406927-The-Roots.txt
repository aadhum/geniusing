Uhhhh, uh uh uh uh
Uhhhh
I just, wanna, see you find the light
I just, wanna, see you
Where you going with all that soul, nigga?
If you can see the trees you can see the truth
But still the light can't reach the roots
Roots, Roots, Roots, Roots (x2)
Doctor said his teeth were looking off white
He told him slow down on the cigs
Didn't know that he was off pipe
Shit was getting hazy
He was looking through the fog lights
He Tony Stark
Grab the iron
He was Megatron that he didn't need the Teflon
Moments later chest was gone, fool
Just pussy popping the lips with a bad taste in his mouth
Now you agitating the Ops
Who that? The Free
I thought you knew that
Nigga never seen a winter this cold
Ask John Cusack
Dash of ginger, put the tingle in your folgers
Moving weight, but no Al Pacino
I got a different kilo
Burden big as boulders
Heavy over beats
Like the Hornets when they left Charolette
Nigga flows like oceans thats uncharted
Drop lines like drunk barbers
They Bob Barker your soul
If you want the truth hit the roots
Bring the Carhartt for the cold
Don't know sunshine down there
Cause the revolution would not be printing the Sun Times round here
They tell him that it's better when you do it for the Cee Lo
But you can't get that deep with no fucking C notes
We do this shit for the Free and everything it denotes
Make sure your roots don't need no remote
