Talk proper, settled at the baritone
Got the Gilroy, tried to hit her with the pheromones (pheromones)
Like a phoenix, young dust out the ashes in a three quarter jacket
beep beep
I'm like "Ma, I got keys to the Jeep"
wrapped in all these instrumentals is intentions and goals
We spreading love, I could never give enough, give it up
Spreading love, I could never give enough, uh
All the time like, 24/7 like, 365 like
Might go 9/11 when we fly low, all under the radar
Fully in command like the space next to the space-bar on a Macbook, I don't play y'all
