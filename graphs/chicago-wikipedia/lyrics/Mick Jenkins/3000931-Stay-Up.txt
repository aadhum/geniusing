Cole park was the hideaway
First day that you took me shit was lookin' like a holiday
Nobody in school everybody kickin' it
One nigga talkin' everybody listenin'
Never paid attention to the shot callas
[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Here, flamin' hots and honey buns are a heart healthy breakfast
Children speak as if their past lives weren't nautical
And newspaper is nothing more than a fan or insulation
It's a cold, cold world for a broke ass nigga
It's a windy city when ain't no warmth in yo' pockets
