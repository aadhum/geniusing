Shouts to 3k
Told me roses stank
I just opened up the pack
I can't tell if that's the dank
Or her rose
She was cold
I'm like shorty what you drink?
Ask me did I have some water
I know you know what I mean
Drop lines you should read in between
Hotlines, we could hop on the phone
Sailor Moon type save the world complex
No contacts, but I see you clearly
I was built for this
Damn near reckon, I might kill for this
Moved the crowd like a pilgrimage
Moved the crowd like police do
When my niggas peacefully assembling
Could see I've seen her and felt adrenaline
Shouts to 3k
Told me roses stank
I just open up the pack
I can't tell if that's the dank
Or her rose
She was cold
I'm like shorty what you drink?
Ask me did I have some water
And I replied, I got ginger beer in the refrigerator
See I ain't getting at you for your derriere
You not a player yeah but I crush a lot of herbs
Roll up big L's
Girl your energy is so flowery
Shouts to 3k
Told me roses stank
I just open up the pack
I can't tell if that's the dank
Or her rose
She was cold
I'm like shorty what you drink?
Ask me did I have some water
