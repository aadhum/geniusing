Still drinkin' water on y'all niggas, man
[Verse]
With perfect pitch I'm singing free my niggas
Polished and purposeful he's producing pristine pictures
Pay me, gimme plenty, the trees begat keys
I'm pressed and like pests, I'm in every nook and cranny
Your pantry, with some patience your panties
I got patience, it's prevalent in the previous plannings
I been on my P's and Q's, fuck is this? A Quiz?
Peep this nigga passion, I'm not picking him to quit
Watch him paint, ain't it quaint?
All that presence in his pen, he be pearlin' all that wisdom, all that pressure be to sin
Niggas quiver in the cold, are you equipped for the weather?
When there's polar and it's piercing through your sweater to your chest
How you persevere and press on through the quest?
I been on my P's and Q's, can't you see I do not play?
And I pack it full of quotes
Pray you perceive it in the way that I intended
I ain't preaching and I'm never that pretentious
Not pretending, Quasimodo how my back is
I've been bending, I've been lifting all the pounds
Politicking with my peoples' then my partner
You picked defeat, if your efforts will only ever be passive aggressive
I been on my P's and Q's, quantum leaps ahead of my peers
They not even in my peripheral, pray I keep it proper
Cause they play it so political, the petty is so pitiful
Niggas Peter Pettigrew, I'm of a higher pedigree
I'm getting high off the feel, y'all just trying to make some coins with it
You've been gifted like I pearled a couple poinsettias
On my P's and Q's
Message never mystical
Breath of antihistamine, I'm trying to heal the physical
Requiring a pivotal stance
For my mans niggas, know I'm not dolo
Provide you with the proof, it's never quid pro quo tho
It's Free Nation, please no photos
Yeah, power to the people, middle finger to the popo
