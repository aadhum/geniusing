Yea, it was right off 79
Real niggas would roam the halls
It was Hirsch High
It was bankin' on your withdrawal
I was shellshocked
Donatello, I'm stickin' to it like a bell hop
Crack the 5 right up the middle
A couple blocks, was just a stone's throw away from the folks
It was at war, I hit the peace pipe
That just means I had no protection
No chance for a nigga to save peso
They say it ain't no love
[Hook]
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
Moët, we pour it up at gatherings that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
Love is what flowers and finish blooms beget
Show me your plot and I'll do the dirt till my wounds cement
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet
Don't let the struggle make your heart harder
Sip the truth, spit the truth
That's the smart water
I'm talkin' gospel, J Hova, no Shawn Carter
It's more cons than pros
The Southside so cold
I suggest your keep your Carhartt
Love is stronger than pride
But also love is a muscle
You gotta build from inside
And amidst the hustle and bustle
Amidst the roll of the thunder
I play the role of a Russell Westbrook or Simmons
Either way Free Nation got a couple more of me on deck
Young Nyjah Huston did the street trials
Kicked and pushed until I beat down barriers
Kicked and pushed until I beat down
They say it ain't no love, but I've seen it, I've seen it
They come few and far between it
But I've seen it, I've seen it, I've seen it
Pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
I bet that you could pray for me
Just holla at me, I could pray for you
Try to make a play for you
Won't you show me...love?
They say it ain't no love here
But I do see blood, tears and sweat
Moët, we pour it up at gatherings that we'll soon forget
Cause the day by day negatives be consumin'
Haters boomin'
