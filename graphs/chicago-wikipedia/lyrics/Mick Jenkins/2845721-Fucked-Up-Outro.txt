[Intro: Michael Anthony]
I cut through the surface
Repair, heal, and spread love
From deep within
work the path and the vision
Then you can see the fruits of living
[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
I been bright
I been in spaces dark as midnight
My pen write on both
My insight on both is skin tight
In spite of the fact that I'm inside the hoax
All my niggas got a horcrux or two or four
We don't die, we multiply but you knew that already
If you don't give me credit for nothing but making kids in Chicago drink more water
I proved that already
I'm someone with influence who'll use that to better the youth
And that don't make me better than you
But as far as this rap shit goes
If Drake ain't holding down Quentin Miller why the fuck would I ever give any credit to you
We shit on these niggas then burn up some incense
Drop off the album and turn up the interest
Make 'em pay interest
Since they was so disinterested before
Check that insolence at the door
Or, it can get a lot more intimate than you expected
The underrated and often neglected
Are often expected to deal with it
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)
[Verse 2: Mick Jenkins]
Like we in here off a meal ticket or something
Still waters run deep as the love and the serve from Serena
Balls in my court and we serving subpoenas
Don't miss this jet ho
Don't miss this view
Straight truth, no tricks, no presto
It's drink more water, don't trip off petrol
Just sip the kool-aid
The same wrist that makes this whip the Pesto
Break bread with me
Better yet, bake bread with me
We be so worried bout how much we need the dough
We tend to forget the little things we need to know
Like how to knead the dough
If done properly it won't spread so thin when your people show
I'm four iPhones and two pencils deep at this point
The cliffs don't seem so steep at this point
And all I see is wolves and sheep at this point
No Lil' Bo Peep
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
I think y'all niggas got me fucked up (fucked up, fucked up, fucked up)
But I cannot go for that, no, oh-oh
(God did not make me that way, God did not make me that way)
Water[s] was just the introduction to the idea that there's this truth...
