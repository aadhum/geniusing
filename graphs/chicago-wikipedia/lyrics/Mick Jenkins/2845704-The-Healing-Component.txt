You wanna know about The Healing Component
No, I know, listen
I mean it's whatever. All you're doing is asking me about the healing component, so whatever you wanna say. Like I said I never explained it to you before either
You actually did but okay let's hear this
You don't remember it?
Yes I do
Alright what's it about?
Alright so uh, what is The Healing Component?
Aw, you tell me
Lately a nigga been meditated
Probably overly medicated
Started drinking water at the party, I ain't even gonna front
Seen him put something in the punch bowls
This box is Supreme and so are the mathematics
Spread love, try to combat the sadness
Got loud to match this
Dose of reality, lit she hit like jabs from Cassius
These titans clashing
Get a new directive
Fuck fucking up a check, it's a new collective
T-H-C, T-H-C
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this T-H-C, T-H-C
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this water (for this water), for this truth (for this truth)
Tryna put some love into everything I do
Thanking you for this T-H-C, T-H-C, T-H-C, T-H-C
[Verse 2]
I'm not always talking marijuana when I'm referencing these trees (trees)
Always talking water but that's just the truth you gotta read between the lines
And got you sniffing coke off hundred dollar bills ('llar bills)
We sip the lean, we pop the pills (the pills)
Why everything that's supposed to be bad gotta be such a thrill
Why is praising mediocrity such a skill
It bothers me
When rich niggas with minds below poverty lines
Get to play like they Socrates
I play like apostrophes
I mean I'm over the words unless they verbs
That's when we see curves like sundresses in June
Who rolled up the truths?
Who rolled up the foots?
Brought the water had these niggas drowning and choking out
Tryna spread The Healing Component
T-H-C, T-H-C
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this T-H-C, T-H-C
For your grace and mercy Father, we thank thee
For this water (for this water), for this truth (for this truth)
Tryna put some love into everything I do
Thanking you for this T-H-C, T-H-C, T-H-C, T-H-C
And I ain't ever claimed all guilt but I know if it was me in that garden
I probably woulda let all hell loose too
Who knew that a young black man might just swoop through with a new roots crew
Like the first time Mike moonwalked
When you know you got something foolproof
This ain't what you smoking on a regular
Smoking on a regular, smoking on a regular
This ain't what you smoking on a regular
