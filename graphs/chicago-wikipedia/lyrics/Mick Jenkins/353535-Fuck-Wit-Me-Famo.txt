South side stepping
Bitch I'm repping where I lay my head, break my bread
63rd and Rose
We blew a joint like moo and oink them pigs
Peanut butters, I pop those
Step up the convo
Rolling up basil leaves and cilantro
Checking out condos
Lofty thoughts get awfully awkward
Reaching them living with low ends
Potpourri if your nostrils open
Come get a whiff of this coffee
I twist it like digits throwing sets
So I paint a picture so vivid to get you wet up
