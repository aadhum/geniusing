They say there's gon' be a downpour
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
We probably gon' need a boat
I'm thinking kindred to Titanic, like why panic
John Legend to slave master, punish a slave faster
She stripping, it all depend on who tipping that bitch
She showed those niggas love, diamond in rough
That's a ten of clubs, they told her it was gon' rain
They told her "do those drugs" then she'll feel no pain
Cold shouldered all the ops they probably cashews
Section 8
My nigga too fly, our people dying I ain't kidding like our tubes tied
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
(They say the water gon' wash us away, no)
Everybody gon' need a boat
(Everybody gon' need a boat)
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
Tell me 'God is gon' save us" now where was this nigga when rain didn't let up
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
They say the water's gon' wash away my people
(They say the water gon' wash us away, no)
Everybody gon' need a boat
(Everybody gon' need a boat)
They say there's gon' be a downpour
(They say there's gon' be a downpour)
