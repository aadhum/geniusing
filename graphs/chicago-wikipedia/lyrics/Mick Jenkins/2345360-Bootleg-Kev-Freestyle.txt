yall
Better know it just a mustard seed all, that I ever really needed
Yea, sippin' water like it come with different cheeses
Hit 'em with the Visine, tried to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers
the best part of waking up is the alignment of self of God
And that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't never really hug the scene
Yall know I been submarine with this shit
A lil' more activist how I lean with this shit
A king, no dream
just Ving Rhames with sick shots
It's a Dawn of the Dead and I feel so alive
Man the free been ahead you can tell by my mind like....
[Aaaaye, Mick Jenkins!] I almost died
