Old ass nigga...
Plastic on the couch's headass
I don't really care about giving this nigga shine
Ain't no light that he could use
It don't make me, no, nevermind
I mean, lets start with the quality of your videos
Guess who's who, this oovoo versus vimeo
Blues clues with the verses
I got all these kids attention
Not to mention all these niggas in your mentions cause they fuck with me
And this is only one percent, my nigga, that's luckily for you
Craig Mack shit, it could get really ugly for you
In reality, this ain't even really nothing new dawg
You even got into it with Lu dawg
Vic Mensa, Joey Purp too dawg
It's like it's what you do dawg
Know you heated cause the city cold to you
And you probably feel like summer, that money saved is old to you
Cause niggas that your dumbass thought was little bros to you
Gave some cold to you and a bitch and you showed through you
How come if no fans then there's no projection
A double entendre
Still surface level, water supposed to teach you deeper lessons
I guess you just another nigga missin' it
I mean, I could've retweeted the comments under every post
At this points responding to you's just doing the most
At this point I could just let it be done
But these days, I ain't been that good with holding my tongue
You insane, I'm Usain, can't keep up with me at all
It's like you bolted to the floor with this shit
I'm on the 47th floor with this shit
Opening doors with this shit
On tour, nigga turnin' down whores with this shit
At your court serving love like a young Serena
It's been apparent that a long time ago you lost consciousness
I'm tryna wake 'em up y'all
It's inception
He's in limbo, I think this nigga stuck y'all
Don't really care about giving this niggas shine
It ain't no light that he could use
It don't make me, no, nevermind
WAKE UP
Wake up, wake up
Wake up
WAKE UP
WAKE UP
WAKE UP
WAKE UP
WAKE UP
