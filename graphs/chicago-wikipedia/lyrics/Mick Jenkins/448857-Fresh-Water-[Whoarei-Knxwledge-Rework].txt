I don't want it
I don't want it fronted
'cus i ain't ever front it
Nigga 6'5", you can see me clearly from the back
Off an edible I wish that you could feel me
Sip the ginger flip the genesis I still see- the simile
Let me chop it with you for your energy
And if you never caught a fade
Better know that I could throw you one
Do it for the love
Nigga free is what I know you like
Writtens got my wrist twistin
Whippin sorta soda like
Tryna catch the vibe your aura sendin me
Are you enemy or is you into me
No signals yet
I'm tryna get connected like a centipede
Puttin in work like mike lowery & martin luther
And mike tyson I might bite em
I know you hear it I know you felt
I'm in this water, you now I'm phelps
