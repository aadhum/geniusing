Focused on threats, I ain't watching no throne
I ain't focused on checks, just the craft that I own
In the wrong neighborhood full of folks that are knowns
Where your pockets get tapped, like we put em on phones
You ain't getting that back, we ain't taking no loans
Fuck you thought it was?
Little nigga got it tucked in his jeans
It's these little niggas got it stuck in their brains, shoot
Pull the trigger til the shit is empty, recoup
Me and my team came after your cream
Caught all of your hoes, then slaughtered your bros
My nigga, we banged all over your scene, BOB
Getting rich or die, dying in the plans somewhere
