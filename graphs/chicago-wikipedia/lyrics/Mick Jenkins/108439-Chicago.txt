I grew up round them white kids first, Paranoid like a crack head
A blemish in they world, yea, I was just a black head
Proactive
they put me with them smarter kids, I didn't care
I was just mad that I was the darkest kid with thick hair
And they stared, like I was not suppose to be in there
I grew up, mama living like Kadeisha and miss Sinclair
That’s single, she didn't like to mingle with her kids there
And when they tried to woo
we brought the Whoo ! like Rick Flair
No chin hair, what was I eleven nigga?
And that’s when you decided that yo kids would come second nigga?
Just barely walking and you still just kept it stepping nigga?
Now that’s some sick shit, what is you a leper nigga?
See that’s the type of shit that make not respect a nigga
Just know the debt you owe is looking real hefty nigga
Nah, I ain’t mad, I just said that for the record nigga
Nah, I ain’t mad I just said that for the record nigga
But I digress and reminisce on days after he left us
When honey buns and flaming hots was healthy breakfast
When micros and kinky twists gave hell to edges
And them girls in your class started wearing heels and wedges, ahhhh
I know somebody out there like “it sound hood homie”
But the hood was all we had, and we made good from it
Especially them D-boys, I know they made good money
Made good dummies, start selling that wet work
Cause we see them stacking paper like cubical desk work
They grandmamma chest hurt
Her heartbroken, cause the streets done got up in ‘em
They rocked the uniform: white tee, 5 pocket denim
Nikes, no clocking in
But they working that nine to five
High key they don’t know better,
buy trees
And go and choke like rabbit first time at the shelter
I see
A people stuck in they ways, no it’s not just a phase
They see a future in tomorrow, they are stuck in a daze
But I got it hot and ready for the street nigga
I’m vegetarian, but it is full of meat nigga
Then hit the mall like I’m hitting athlete figures
I’m just warming up, but they say that I’m sautering this
But got on my Scrappy Doo, just “let me back at ‘em “
And show ‘em how I’m much flyer than your average kite
And now they grabbing tight
But I’m just picking them off me
Writing these death certificates, Killing them softly
