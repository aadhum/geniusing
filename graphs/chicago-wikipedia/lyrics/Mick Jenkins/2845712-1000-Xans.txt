In some circles misconceptions make 'em think my inspiration herbal, it's not
I mean sometimes it is
I mean sometimes I'm tweaking and laughing 'til I hurt ribs
Forever creeping until I'm peaking through valleys and skies
That's the heavens, I mean I'm trying to get high
Some claiming cloud 9's, I'm floating around 11s
Rose grown in the alley
No stems for the thorns
Cause those buds is from Cali
I mean the buzz could last a lightyear
I played boggle at a young age
So a nigga know words
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched
It's just the motherfucking drugs
I can't shake it, it got me shaken
I feel like I'm breaking everything I've touched
Cause food is a whole ass drug
I mean Ronald is a old ass plug
And he chopping rocks for cheap to keep your whole ass stuck
The black Neo of this Matrix
Directing homeostasis
No pay phones it's getting harder to leave
