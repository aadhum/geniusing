You say you a bad bitch
You got ass, you got ass
You got ass and tits
Where you buy that, girl?
Where you cop that?
Where you buy that, girl?
Where you cop that?
Where you cop-cop that?
I say you just average
You do coke, you pop pills, got no skills
All of your girls stand in line for the bathroom
Coming out faded
no Peter Parker
Could spin a web of lies like this
A measure of a woman is defined by thick
What would you do to be noticed?
Singing, what would you do on some Klondike shit?
And her pussy on point
She ain't never been afraid of needles
A simp ass nigga gone fuck, resistance is feeble
Fuck pilates, you purchased the
perfect
body
Thirst is probably got you parched
You got niggas out here thirsty with them ass shots in starch
And I swear that she used to be darker, no Peter Parker
Could spin a web of lies like this
The measure is a woman who's defined by thick
What would  you do to be noticed
Screaming what would you do on some Klondike shit?
World star hip hop
Do this shit (?)
Even though you put my motherfucking video out there
Showing my cooty-cat
Who does that?
Y'all ain't even pay me for that
But you know what, imma' let you have that cause I'm a real bitch
And I'll let you keep that little bit of money, it's okay
You know, you put my business out in the streets
World star hip hop
But guess what?
Y'all can kiss my ass
Cause I'm still the baddest bitch
Cooty-cat or not
And I have a pretty pooty-cat
For y'all motherfucking haters
Get with the program
The baddest bitch alive
The Puerto Rican princess
Shout out to the real niggas!
My booty is fat, my titties are fat, my stomach is flat
And I'm the baddest bitch
And bitches don't hate
Get with the motherfucking program
Get like me
Don't be mad at me cause I do what I do
