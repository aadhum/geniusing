Since Oakwood I’ve been moving this dope
Trying to give you this truth
So potent every line is quote
Or a hit, I’m a fiend
Niggas scratching like I been in a dj booth
You don’t want this smoke roll the words I wrote
Puff puff til the joint go poof
Southside where they shoot magazines
I’m alive never picture me posing, nah
I ain’t never did GQ, and I ain’t never claimed GD
I’m just with my folks
Do it for the Free even when I’m broke
College Dropout, he drive slow
Next best out the Chi and I told y’all I ain’t leaving no room for no debate on that
I’ma keep dropping bombs, I ain’t really gotta flex for that
