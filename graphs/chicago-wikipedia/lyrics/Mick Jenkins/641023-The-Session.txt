It was 6 o'clock in the eve, we thinkin' 'bout goin' H.A.M
We vibin' to Mrs. Badu
Open another a bottle
Them hoes was a couple 7's and now they lookin' like models
Comfortable in her skirt
Shoulders had mellowed out
Drinks was startin' to work
Shorty was still sittin' but hips had started to twerk
Twerk
Shorty twerk
Work
Shorty work
