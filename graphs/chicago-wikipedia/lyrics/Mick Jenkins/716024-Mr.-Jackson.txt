Take two
Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
I can blow it all and roll up something stupendous
Or coastin' in my car, cause niggas wanna go thriftin'
Or floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars, heard Mars got pretty bitches
I'm floating through the stars
Stars... (x6)
Twenty in my pocket
How will I spend it?
Smoking shit that is guaranteed to have you suspended
Them other rappers in there, I'm comin' for they necks like a razor after chin hair
I been rare, like steaks that's undercooked
I stay under radar, that's why I'm overlooked
Can't see me, like Stevland Morris, better known as Stevie
