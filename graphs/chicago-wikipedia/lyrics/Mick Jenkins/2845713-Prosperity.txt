No longer ashamed of my thread count
Time spent is still like the only real measure
Of the four letter word
Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
Spread love
Fuck a dollar
Fuck your lover, get some head-love
You see, I'm only ever lost when I ask where the trees at
Niggas lashin' cause they simply missed the message, listen
See a chance startin', I'ma take one
Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
OK, the love of money root of all evil
the camel through a eye of a needle 'fore a rich man
Before a rich man know heaven
So I'm in this bitch, no wrist band
Say, "he trippin'" till you check my balance
10 years later you can check my talents
I done doubled up from a 2-4 from 5-10
I never been no type of man to hide his shit beneath the dirt
Big bracelets, Rollies, big faces
Jesus pieces can't save you
VVS is stressin'
