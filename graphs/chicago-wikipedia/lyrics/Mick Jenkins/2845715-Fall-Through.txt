[Intro]
I see the light
Hesitate
Hesitate
Hesitate
Hesitate
Don't you feel the soul?
That's the truest well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate
Stop, dropped and rolled in the middle of this fire
And the smoke, nigga had to go and breathe for a second
Plus I needed direction, a fork in every road at like three intersections
Pray for discernment, I'm seeking his blessing
This ain't no sermon but vermin ain't never want to see they reflection
Come and see his reflection
Like
So sticks and stones I rub them off
At this hater conjunction I'm an apostrophe, above them all
That's why I keep my circle small
Seen so many rush as Limbaugh
Niggas talking shit that I just cannot trust at all
But trust I fall, you can trust I'll tell you just how I trip
Before I ever power trip
brought the light like a power strip
Fuck a Powerade, we bringing water
On some straight 'Black Power' shit
Shift the culture watch the power shift
Fist raised, nigga proud as shit
Even if you wasn't privy to the trees know you hear the leaves loud as shit
When autumn asked you
Do you (do you do you do you do you...)...
Children of the Indigo
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (When autumn falls, you see the leaves)
You feel me, y'all don't hear me though (You feel the breeze, you feel the breeze)
Don't you feel the soul?
That's the truest well
Of all the things you know, do you know yourself?
Well enough to trust the way you go
When you don't, know the way
See the light, still hesitate
See the light, hesitate
We descendants of the illest souls
Children of the Indigo
I been all around the globe, different languages they feel me they don't hear me though
Told us we was inferior, we imperial
I've been talking all this Lake Superior
Politicking with my big homie Sensai
City really been on fire since 10Day
Shave the truffles on my penne I'm eating good
Fuck the opposition gotta do with my position?
Is it popping or is y'all just politicking
[Outro]
'Coz I might fall through if I catch the breeze
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
Children of the Indigo
Know you probably missed the roots, but I know you seen the leaves (seen the leaves)
Children of the Indigo
