[Verse 1: Mick Jenkins]
(It's 18 hundred ways you can take the...)
It's 18 hundred ways
You can take the truth straight to the face
Better keep the pace
If you drinking this fam
Couple shots and that be it fam
Keep it thorough as a New York borough
Frankincense and myrrh, heaven sent these gifts
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
Good smoke, lungs stronger
Damn near breathing underwater
Damn near feeling just like Peter
Damn near walking on this shit until I falter
Young Jerry Rice going deep...with it
See it clear through Fetty Wap left, I don't even gotta creep...with it
Monkey see, monkey do
Crabs in a barrel everybody sheep...with it
Thousand count sheet fitted everybody sleep with it
Police can't keep pulling these triggers
Won't go for that shit much longer
This ain't Country Time
This ain't Minute Maid
This ain't lemonade
It ain't never that sweet
You can never match me
More and more vultures coming at we
Racists motherfuckers ain't happy
Me and all my niggas in here banded up
Don't get it twisted fam this ain't backstreet
If we eliminated every black invention
Motherfuckers wouldn't last a week
This ain't Country Time
This ain't Minute Maid
This ain't lemonade
It ain't ever that sweet
