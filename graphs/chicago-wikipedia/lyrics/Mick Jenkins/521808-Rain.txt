Hit this Indonesia, tell me how you feel, we got hella chill
Alcohol never was the thrill, hella ginger ale (HELLLAAAAAAA ginger ale, my nigga)
I'm too on point, no need to point 'em out or pin the tail
Like huh? What? Where did this nigga come from?
He speak his spoke with so many layers, he must be onion
I am peeling back all these roots
They peeling caps in the streets
Hit this helium, I'm straight past your ceiling like fuck the roof
And I'm healin' 'em, straight penicillin out the syringe
Sealin' the joint with lemon kush
And jasmine blends the bride and groom
Seal territory in these waters, fuck a Heidi Klum
Fuck a tidy room, it's dirty in these streets
Out my window, I can see my people's pain
Never tears, though, they blend in with the rain
Shit is gettin' old, niggas grindin' for the gold
Ain't really no goal, he just shinin' for the hoes
And she got her ass out, she just tryna get chose
All I ever brought was ginger ale for when it throws
Look at my city and tell me that shit look pretty
The south side is like a blemish, like country breakfast, it's gritty
People movin' with purpose, the petty only get pity
Peep the proof of the purchase, I'm barely pushin' them pennies
I've been doin' it for free, my nigga, shouts your Link card
I'm just out here tryna free my niggas
Cause the shit is gettin' old and they comin' for your gold
Thick socks for your sole,
Shoulders gettin' cold like the winter when it snows
So I'm here for your tears, I forever wish you rain
