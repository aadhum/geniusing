Life ain't nothing but a cat-mouse, nigga
Mice get trapped in the trap house, nigga
Lives get sacrificed in the streets
White lights when you blackout, nigga
Niggas talk shit but I'm over their verbs like accents and apostrophes
Black rap
mans dichotomy
Better call your god if you doubt my G

Just ginger ale for your hoes, I don't want they souls
Just ginger ale for your hoes, I don't want they souls
Don't you see the pennies,  I don't need your two cents
