I think I might have what you, what you want, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I think I might have what you, what you need
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
[Verse 1]
The Parmesan ain't never been the problem
You'll probably miss the point if coin is all that's on your palate
Changed a whole lot
Shout to DJ Khaled
This one here is Black affirmation that we sunkissed
And my worth and my God and my devil, I never did Prada
I'm comin' at giants with pebbles
And praying three times a day
So nigga throw me with the lions or rebels
And I will eventually find a way
No mortal man could ever come take my kind away
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
If the alcohol gonna make you tell then truth, then let's get wasted (wasted, wasted, wasted)
If you want the truth from me, I got the water, you ain't even gotta chase it, do you?
And the basis is love, and this shit came straight from above
His homie sold him out for the silver
It's beside the point but it wasn't even gold bruh
Still die for a nigga just like him, and I know a nigga just like him
And that ain't nothin' but love, that ain't nothin' but love
This THC ain't just no fuckin' weed, this ain't no weed
Know I keep the water for the tree, for the tree, yeah
