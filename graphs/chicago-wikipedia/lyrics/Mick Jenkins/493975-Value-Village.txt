Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, and they telling you they love it
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen, save money, nigga
Don't listen, save money
Don't listen
Fuck yo, designer on my momma I get fly without them labels
15 minute savings, stacking paper with no staples
Geico wonder how I do it
Shot from every angle, yet this style is so congruent
I make these niggas mad when I'm dressing like they dads, out the 80's
Rekindle that fire, now I'm sparking all the interest with they ladies
Like where you get your clothes nigga, what you call your style boy
Can you take me shopping to some places I ain't never been?
Emani found that Dolce and Gabbana and Benny rocking the shit up out that letterman
Letters falling off but never ever is cheddar falling off
No never ever is cheddar falling off, nigga
And I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That YSL fly as hell but fuck it, I'm on a budget
Man fuck it, I'm on a budget
And, I be lying if I ain't tell you I love it
That YSL fly as hell but fuck it
Tell them, fuck yo, designer on my momma 'til I'm rolling in that dollar
Liable to find your ho some Oval and Taiga
For like three bucks
Ralph Lauren slacks, I cuff the crease up
Like denim off your ass, boy why it so tough to keep up?
Comme des Gar√ßons
kiss my ass
And if they horses on it, fuck yo' vest
I'm on that Brooklyn Cirque Du Soleil shit
With a pair of killer gloves on some OJ shit
Stepping on the scene on some probate shit
And I dress it like I spit it on some Colgate shit
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck the mall
Fuck yo' full price
Fuck yo' sales ho
Fuck, I'm dead broke
So fuck yo' sales ho
