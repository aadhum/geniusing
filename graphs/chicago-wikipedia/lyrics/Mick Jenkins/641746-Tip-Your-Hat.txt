Middle of a Alabama summer, field nigga weather
Value Village trippin' 'bout to catch a deal with the cheddar
Tell 'em that i'm straight up out the Chi
And i'm fly
91st & Langley, neighborhood guy
Went to Hirsch, off the 9
Seen to many in a herse from the 9
Lot of busted holes couple of them fine
Nevermind
When it's hot, niggas get froze
That's just how it goes
In the hood
