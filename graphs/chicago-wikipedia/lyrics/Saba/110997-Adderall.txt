You know the ones when your eyes don’t close at all
And this girl want me over
But my grade can’t afford it
So I’ll pass so I can pass
Just last week seven hours of sleep
And that was in total
But I swear to God if my teacher test me
(Contains sample from Juicy J "We Trippy")
I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
You know I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
Cuz I don’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
No I don’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
So I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
You Know I’ll be
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
Cuz I can’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so trippy)
No I can’t sleep
(At your local college baggy full of adderall, so)
My to-do list is like an encyclopedia
I need something to keep me up, for real
Cuz Red Bull no longer gives me wings
And mommy sings me lullabies and they don’t put me to sleep
It’s time for bed, my eyes are red
so why don’t you go?
I’m like I got a show
My phone ring (phone ring)
And I’m ignoring all my calls (all my calls)
Only hit me up you got Adderall (Adderall)
Got a 30 page paper due next week (next week)
