Fakin' a fight it is not real, John Cena
Filled of frost, on that Wendy's city shit
With the fam like Caillou, listenin' to Badu
watching T-Mac vs. Ivu
Yo, Poetry in motion how my haiku's movin'
Fan base universal not just high school students
I'm Peter Petrelli, a hero
Uh,I skipped college no honor, roll
About to eat, devour beat like this shit so delicious!
Doctor Lipschitz, since a rugrat,
