[Verse: Saba]
Was scared of shit in my mind, now I smile in my pic's online
Isolation taught me patience 'bout the way to go
Had to learn my mama depression wasn't my own
Had to feel the pressures of the pessimism
Trying to convince me that realism was a better vision
Never been accepted in the ghetto, but I'm on Division
And I'm livin', inability to be myself in a room full of niggas
Focused on hittin stains and gettin' bitches
I don't speak, I'm silent as a mouse by my own house
With a bit of bitterness, worried about fittin' in
And I go to school the next day like ain't shit happen, excelled in great grades and they ain't matter
Standardized tests educate data
Granny lost her brother, her other brother, her daddy
You wonder why I don't drink
Wonder why I don't smoke
I wish I didn't have to be famous to be important
Left the hood, somehow I made it back
Back to life, back to reality
Will my life, ever belong to me?
Hypothesize the definition of free
Realize this dream wasn't meant to be
I too am an American dreamer
I too dream of American freedom
I too sing an American plea
I too scream 'til liberty rings and (x4)
