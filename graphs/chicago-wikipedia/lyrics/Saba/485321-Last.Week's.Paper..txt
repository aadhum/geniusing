I’m in the hood like I’m Eric Wright in 85
I’m too prudent, straight A student
Ladies call me mean cause I don’t speak
Ain’ that my ways, I’m a shy guy
All my mutual friends through FB comment on my Youtube
Like yo you rap ain’t know you do that, but like who you ‘pposed to be
Lupe or something, is you getting paid or something
You doing big, nigga you think you faith or something
