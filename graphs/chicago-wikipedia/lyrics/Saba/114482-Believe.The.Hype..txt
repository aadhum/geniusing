Saved up enough, now it’s time to spend some
Records in my archive, gone spin one
Zone in ya eardrum
But there isn’t a comparison
So there is no resemblence
Enter this my entrance like titantron
If I was you, I’d be alarmed like early morning
This the part where I go
Mayhem cuz Im back with a vengeance
Like revengers
Payback from a young prince
Nigga hum this tune on the moon
Cuz even on mute, you hear it
Lyrics reach out and touch your spirit
Eye open, Eye closing
Emoticon, semi colon
Encore, clapping nolia
I’m annoying I’m anointed
Higher up, my bars are bouyant
Hit and run, there’s another hit
Like relationship of battered wives
You keep coming back don’t you?
I make you want to
Any problem coming up
Know we nip it in the bud
And you gone worry, don’t worry bout us
Tell em everything gravy nigga
Mashed potato ah
And you gone worry, don’t worry bout us
