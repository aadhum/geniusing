indigo
Hitting blocks till in the store
Such N Such, Save Mula
Saba saying PIVOT though, Pivotal
That’s enough hang it up, Mistletoe
They say you judged by the company you keep
Oh well word?
Well I’m with real niggas, what do that make me?
Surrounded by the illest, PIVOT
Get ya muscle up, bodybuilder, Arnold
Go in like a hard on
My flow hard core
Arkham asylum psychotic cottonmouth rhyming
And dreams valid
Boy I’m fleetwood mack
Like Jimmy Jones fill your cups up with juices
Such N Such saving it up
You spending it all
Get played like you dumb
But nigga you say she the one
My niggas above
More than just a rim
Like 2Pac Shakur
That 1994 hit
My flow the cleanest, get my lather on
Yeah I scrub-a-dub
Such N Such
And Jean Deaux, nigga that’s the cuz
And it’s for the love
Like a bone thug
Strictly for my niggas, Pac in ‘93
That’s a small circle
