For the real world, that my teacher keep talkin bout?
Im trying to buy a planet, she talking bout a house
And eyeing spouses, but I ain’t bout that
I’m about to blow up
And they’ll just be like so uh..
Remember me from high school?
No actually I do not (no)
We all wanted real jobs
And lil nigga you thought you was 2Pac
And stepped outside of my comfort zone
Like the black pinocchio just tryna be a real nigga
I see dead people, Shyamalan
You epic fail. You babylon
And you need to be in it
So here take this joint and sip this liquor
Oh your favorite player was Tmac?
Impossible don’t exist?
Remember that?
I’m evolving
Til school year next august
