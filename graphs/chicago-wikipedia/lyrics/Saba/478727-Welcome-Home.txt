Yo Saba it's been a minute, you better, you benefited, is that what you thinkin' now?
My nigga comin' home soon, he found
If you think you gettin' known soon, don't
Welcome home a doormat
Yo, I walked in Def Jam on my 19th birthday, I can't recall my 18th
I just pray that you get home safely, ironically the green line trained me
Cause I was softer than cotton startin' college something that here you can't be
Can't see them niggas gettin' on no time soon, we worried 'bout survival out here
Like where the hell I'm gonna get my food, nigga fuck your song I don't care
So where I'm gonna get my support at?
Where you go when you on your last?
The fam you actually had before rap
But my heart can't be teflon, I feel everything and some
