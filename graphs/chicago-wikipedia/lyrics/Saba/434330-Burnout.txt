My grandad adamant about Adam and evil
How after the show in the back it's a Katt Stacks dyin' to meet you
I wanna rap with the Beatles, I just wanna rap like the Beatles
On the road to success caught a detour, picture me tourin' in England
I got stranded in Englewood outside of this chick's house
And since then I ain't ever really been south
I'm on mute with no remote, so I don't talk much
they theme music on cassette
Yellow tapes
Seen a guy on a bus ride, he'll probably die doin' dope
In Armageddon
I'mma be a nigga with a sword, like Mace Windu
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out
Crashin' cars like burnout, I got burnout
So I dropped out, see I turned out okay
On the Holy Bible told a lie to teachers in the twelfth grade
On my entrance essay, I just want to live, find a college to attend
Get a pup and picket fence, stop the choosin' and just pick
In my head I keep a pic with a fist on the end
I'm hella out west though, where the buses stop runnin' early
I used to run home, I was scared to walk, people bled at dark
It's funny we play with chalk, and then lay in chalk
Foreshadow the shadows, it's more cattle for tattles
It's beef or snakes with the rattle, they tryin' to dethrone your castle
I call it like a sportscaster with stats on tally and tackles
I told this lie for a white whore who thinks I'm a statistic
Bitch you hate your job, so fuck your condescendant, I got common sense
You got passed up like a close call, don't let them catch you sleep and doze off
Hey universe, don't come at me with your bullshit
Your nonsense, your issues, can't handle it
These problems keep me up at night
But in the end there just problems and everybody got some, right?
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
Shut up, shut up, don't nobody want to hear that
I'm right here, we burnup
Pull the windows down and roll out
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies show me love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up, yeah wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies show me love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
