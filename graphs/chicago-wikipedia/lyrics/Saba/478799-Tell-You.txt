Diamonds are forever yet even a rock broke up
Magazines, the faster things leave quickly as they came
Leave as quickly as they came
I’m grown up, what a change
I said I wouldn’t put that in a rap a lot
I say a lot, I figured it’d be aight
And we can be forever as long as the sky is lit
And even in the dark we ultraviolet
And a chick with a bit of aphrodisiality
The grass is green, garden of eden speaking
