Skydiving, hoping my pilot land and my 'chute is good
And my show went well and my cheque about to go to the hood
If I die before I can make change, 'least I made a tape
And I pray someday you're inspired by it and make your way, look
All aboard, it's just like the Green Line, we finally off the train
All I wanted [?]
swear I must got angels
swear I must got angels
I ain't never smoke, fuck it? Why not? Guess I'm trying pot
Might just say "fuck it", get my hair cut and say "bye to locks"
Yeah, thinking outside them squares
Whole world know what it is
Scratching off my bucket list
swear I must got angels
swear I must got angels
