[Intro: Sample]
I'm ridin' like I fell in love
We out the hood it's better for us
A private school in the suburbs
They wanted me to speak up more
And I took this shit overboard
I walk up in this bitch like ya'll know my name but it's funny cause I used to be kind of shy
Like, remember when [?] said hi, and I would just walk past her
I got a lot to say but not a lot of space so I talked faster
Now I'm far from the silent, feelin' less lost and misguided
College course is horse shit,
no offense and I'm still undecided
On the fence like I was just here for the ride
I'm not up for election
So quiet, because rejection like my biggest fear
My character embarrassed, that it´s hard to just be myself
My cellphone went from zero contacts to 'bout a million in a year
If it’s flawed, it falls
If it's real, it won't
Talk about some shit you've been through instead of Bentleys and bent knees
They not alive but one dimensional, he went to the bank and withdrew his soul
But my soul is what I give you
Like Cassius duckin' the draft, now the fight is over hopefully I can win
At war with yourself when you look in that mirror you realize who you been fightin'
I'm out my comfort zone, I found myself, now accept me for me
Fake girls callin' me by my real name
Well wishes like a quarter thrown
I'm 'bout to take it back like the waiter got your order wrong
Black ops lurkin' like COD
And white cops wanna kill me
Only cause I'm a black boy
They kill niggas for their Concords
Me, I'm just tryin' to go on tour
You must got your finger pricked on a spindle
Friends call me L'z, but you can call me Vincenzo
Minus the Uzi and kitchen
I'm on a mission 'til it's
Breakfast at Wimbledon
You need a dollar I got ya,
spot ya like Glenn Close
They pulled me over, L'z suspended, damn, I didn't know
Didn't matter, cuffed to a banister, finger prints on a scanner
Most niggas that talk about shootin' dudes is actors
To keep it real you probably hard as chutes & ladders
My next shit a brick of piff, you smell it through the plastic
Sonnin' all you bastards
and you gon' meet the parents like a male nurse
send that bitch to the moon
Remind me to let you know if the hammer fell first
Zoe Saldana
Might cut her off right after summer, I don't really want her
Keep it a hundred, she just a prima doma that's on a scholarship
I told her save that shit to a floppy disk
Girl save that shit to a floppy disk
