Y’all to busy joking, y’all to busy riddler
So two face is next,
Me and [?] smoking in the basement and all we doing is rapping
That nigga started trapping, but I’m too focused, I’m too focused
My time now, get used to me
I’m only writing a eulogy
Like what’s a verse, I’m only writing a hearse
Cards is dealt then I’m all in nigga
