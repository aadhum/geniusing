[Intro]
(Russell Westbrook)
What?
Bro, what are you talking about man?
Bro, I’m out man, ya'll niggas trippin’
You can’t get paid in a earth this big
You’re worthless, kid
When daddy said he was leavin’, did it hurt mom?
Wait, wait who the fuck is this new nigga on her arm?
They call him shorty I’m a shorty damn near his height
You get outta the car you hitchhike, you ain’t ridin’ with us
You can die my nigga, I don’t care if I’m 5 my nigga
But everybody like you except me and you trynna accept me
Shit it would be easy if you bribed a nigga
Taj
to come out
I, look around and go downstairs, ‘cause even if I don’t wanna go I know that my momma wouldn’t allow it
He took me to the store and told me that he got me
And then I started pickin’ out shit, glass cut, inside Gold
And a sphere so it rolls, it looked like a bunch of globes
We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin’
Foreign, orbit
The big one is my shooter
Shorty is the man to me now
You owe him money, better have it all
‘Cause you comin' with half, let's just say that that's something he won’t have it all
For salary, people hustle like Cassidy
I just got a new Casio and a karaoke machine
light
Got into my first fight, and he lost his front teeth
Shorty taught me a cool handshake and I thought we made it up
Got to high school and realized we was just shakin' up
We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin’
Foreign, orbit
You can’t get paid in this earth this big
You’re worthless, kid
Time to take action, affirmative
Bump, some alternative like
I ain't never heard of this, shorty let me burn the disk
Keepin' his head above water like he learned to swim
seen
Makes his way to a car, he go to pick up my mom
Like heaven can wait
When you this big planets start look like marbles
Just pray they don't use the sun as a shooter
We're all formless
Shapeless, flowin’
Foreign, orbit
