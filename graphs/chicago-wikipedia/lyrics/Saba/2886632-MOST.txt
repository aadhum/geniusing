Snakes and a python, wrong with your haircut?
Hand on the bible
Sleep when it's bedtime
Gave up the airtime, whole city graveyard
Ball with a ballpoint
And most of these shooters be the boys in the blue
[Verse 2]
Ridin' with a new scent, chain like a new noose
Cop in the rear-view, save all your two cents
Try and catch me like Mewtwo, they'll be happy to shoot you
Life not some sitcom
Streamin' on Hulu, there's no one to the rescue
No one to defend you
Most of the youth in love with a gun
'Cause most of the young don't wanna be young
[Skit: Chance The Rapper]
