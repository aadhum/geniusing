See the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove...the right direction
'Cause I don't wanna slow...down for no gas
And plus I'm runnin' low on cash
But I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California
Hmmm mm mm Cali, Cali
What does love look like in the 22nd century? Merely a memory
I sip the tea after my opinion
They Pistol Pete, dishin' out assistance
I said I stopped dreamin', instead I decided to chase
And I ain't look back, that's how you turn to stone
My first friend up in high school was a Stone
He said come and join, I ain't come along
Not cause I'm high and mighty, just cause I knew right from wrong
Somewhere I belong, looked but I didn't find
But instead of getting discouraged I got my city behind
Now I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY
Next month LA, then back West Side
You change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe
He got out of prison then called my phone like, "where ComfortZone?"
And since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back
I finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask
They ask me "why the Bucket List?"
You know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock, made it to the top of the precipice

Yo yo yo what up? This is Lupe Fiasco
And my bucket list...has many things in it
One of 'em is uh, wantin' to win the Nobel Prize, for somethin'. Uhhhh, I also want...yeah that's it, I just wanna win the Nobel Prize
Yeah!
