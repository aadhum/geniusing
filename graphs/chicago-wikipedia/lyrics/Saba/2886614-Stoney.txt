Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Use to dream about it when my cousin had a cutlass
Hit up Jay Caves, turned it to a video
Riding with the windows up because my shit is broke, just like we were broke
Coppers tryna impound vehicle, we all see ‘em though
Ay, Squeaky had a Buick he would play our latest music
I just backseat drive, catch the vibes, in a hooptie
Yeah, tryna finesse uber with a new email
Ay, pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
Kobe whipped a station wagon and he hotbox that bih’
Came home straight skunk like I know my mama mad
Still don’t smoke but I smell like my friends
All my nigga day one like they just got the job
Never bought a train card, but bet they will train hop
Yeah, I just bought a hooptie I can get from A to B
Yeah, wildin' with my brother’s Waters, can’t wait till he free
Remember they ain’t show no love
Now it’s only PDA
Ay, screaming Pivot loud as fuck ‘cause that is really fam
Pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
I'ma pull up in my bucket and I’m feeling like fuck it
Felt the same way when I ain’t pull up in nothing
CTA short, balling on a budget
