West side spawn yeah
Real life law and order
Six piece coleslaw
By Max Payne sawed off
Dodge em in slow mo
No homi’s in Oak Park
You late as Peter Parker with a pizza
I'm so far
Ahead I'm like Mozart
Conducting an orchestra
My paper the origami
Been folded since Folgers
That's like 4AM
Or since I been 4 feet
I been in this shit y'all talking Kylie
I am quite offended giving wisdom
Like it’s my teeth
Tag-a-long like it
Soap box on my stage bout to start a mosh pit
Been killing this shit since I was 14
I'll let you meet my team
I been too quiet now I'm outta my shell
They ain't rocking with it, oh well
Bucket list completed
Bury me a legend
Cut my granny pension
I might have to cut a nigga
Politicians pimped us
Heard another school closed
Districts discuss
Imma need that back plus interest, interest
You are not a person nigga
You look like a serpent with a
Plan that's parallel to poverty
Bout to split the dividends
Me and my degenerates
I been too quiet now I'm outta my shell
They ain't rocking with it, oh well
