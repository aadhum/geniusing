Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
President off a write ins they not even on the ballot
Spreading love like rotation I just pass it like in Cali
I been running rap so long damn my foot got a callus
City cold think you need a coat but you really need a vest
Speak on if you blessed I'm coming for your heart like skeeting on your chest
[?]
You'll be gone in a year like you signed to Diddy
It is not a biggy it is natural
[?]

Good riddance, Good riddance, I drop good writ-tens
Parade daily that's Bud Billiken
Drop a tape and they lovin' it
It's in my genes my blood denim
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Westside rasied me I should get that shit tatted
Grabbing that knife you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Westside raised me I should get that shit tatted
Animal beats so I Dr. Doolittle them
My pseudonym is GYM
I stay working it out
Killing the fear and the doubt
People keep dying we keep buying the liquor just to pour it out
The earth is a drunk just spinning around
Grabbing that life you can be living and never get right
If you looking down how you put up a fight?
Pick your head up never let up never said once it was gon' be easy
Cause a nigga with attitude a lil less scary than a man on a mission
And I'm painting this clear like a radiant child
Same old same old
We are engine number 9 or number 6 what's the difference?
compassion at war
no Basedgod but ain't it I
Buzz got the worlds eye Lil B
