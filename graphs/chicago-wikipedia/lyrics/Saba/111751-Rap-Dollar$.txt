I’m that loser that they let sit with the cool kids
Like Lazarus, I resurrected rap.
Like resuscitation, bro I brought it back
To Life
My bills never paid on time
This the life that I chose
Getting choked up on the stage at 15
Is this really your scene?
While Pops was singing
We on Massasoit
With a 4-track and more raps
I wish I could build me a spaceship and fly
Towards them
Say, did that blog post you?
Pro tool
Or is he too far gone?...
The Drake
He popping now, consider dropping out
Cuz school the opps
if I ain’t on when I hit 20
Are you still rocking with me?
You can see my gift, like a bad wrapper
Sab fans is family
This all we know
This all we are
