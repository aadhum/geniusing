And I put a few pounds on
Since I had my cap and gown on
Uh Aye tested out, no scantron
Bout to put my camp on
Penny for my thoughts, pitching coins on the playground
A spark from the pen and the pad and bet they all will come with me
From the ground up like a snow man
I'm your man to gamble on
Play my cards, I get my gambit on
