Here 911 don't come though
Next door from a bando
Yeah I'm Back inside my fucking mind
I swear this like my biggest fear
I fucked around and almost died
The last time that I took this trip
I never said I was a saint
Just said that I didn't smoke
Never said shit about my family who overdosed
Momma drinking comatose
It's in my genes like a chromosome
Daddy left he said he won't be long
But He was also wrong
I go to school from my grandma home
Seen my mom in that ambulance
She was laid out on the floor
And didn't recognize her boy
Hunnid none less you lose your hand you try to short me too
