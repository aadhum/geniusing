You are all the cause
This for you, this for you
This for y'all
On my second bowl of cereal, second semester
Me and my classmates all on separate sections
City on the rise from decadent anthems
Funny they wanna see us all rot just
Drown out the ant farm, used to rock Phat Farm
Used to watch Cat Dog, now you a rap star
And I started hating this song while writin' it
She came to my crib and she leave with bites and shit
I can't even sleep in my bed
I still got degrees on my head
The temperature hot
Silkk The Shocker, got no limit, limit
You are all the cause
This for you, this for you
This for y'all
Young nerd Neutron, didn't fuck with my prom
But turned in writin' prompts
Uncle on lock, they probably scared I got a bong
But Jimmy good, he all straight
We know this nigga beatin' his case
Like how you innocent in inner city
They scared of you like Insidious city kid
City on the brink of extinction
And all we do is sing songs I see ya'll
Cause the funeral love the young brother who doesn't know better
Still O.C. with it can't seem to control his fuckin' temper
wanna
You are all the cause
This for you, this for you
This for y'all
And even if we don't get rich up out up this bitch
We don't get ticks on Priceline quick
Enough to where they jump, way way up
And you can't afford the shit
We still gon' do it my nigga
We still gon'-still gon' screw on them bitches
I treat you like Blood
And I treat you like Cuz, 'cuz
Yo it's us and them, red stripes, on the corner every night
Argue though you dead right, and I'm dead wrong,
no headlights
And them red lights behind us,
they don't mean nothing as long as you don't, Go reachin' for something then give them a reason to shoot up the truck up
Cause you supposed to be protectin' and servin' the public
Take turns like she a Nintendo
Understand me, 10-4
