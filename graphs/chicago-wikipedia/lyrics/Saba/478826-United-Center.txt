The United Center
You actually could have made it out
While you were learning to spell, your friends were getting expelled
Your mama sure taught you well
Grandma sure taught you well
Proud of where I’m brought up, brought up in the heart of
A slums
I didn’t get a gun when you’re born
Well you better have a nice pump, fake
And the goal is to go pro
This for all those who had these dreams then got cut from the B team
I want to be the next one to blow
blow
inception
I’m gon get me some
Plus my teachers keep telling me that, that I’m remedial
These braille raps, you got to feel
Brand name everything, imagining we endorsed
My backyard was the mad house on Madison
I feel like I’m just supposed to be on some Late Registration shit and names, like everybody that’s doing shit
Squeak on the boards
Noname Gypsy in this bitch
Legit in this bitch
All these niggas lame as hell for being in here sleep
