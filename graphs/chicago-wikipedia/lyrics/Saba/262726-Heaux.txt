It's Free Nation
We just a couple of pimps, no ho's
My loafers laced with them Lincolns ho
Free my niggas, thatâ€™s Lincoln heaux!
From the first all the way to the 15th
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln heaux!
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln heaux!
Free my niggas
Move through the city like parkour
Cus the South side lookin like Darfur
I just keep my pace, young Paul George
They set traps and they call em traps and we fall for it
Free the guys
They just want dough, then pizza pies
They more true to that then they are to they denim
My wrist watch go tick-tock
I tell them hoes to kick rocks
Fuck thirst traps, i pick locks & purse snatch
The midnight marauder
My niggas will prolly end up in yo daughter
The southside is like a blemish, like country breakfast is gritty,
Free my niggas, that Harriet
On the Tubman
We gettin paid in full  so we eatin
And yell: FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S LOCKED UP!
FREE MY NIGGAS THAT'S TRAPPED TOO!
Micheal Scofield, prison break on a break
heat up like I'm Penny
Hardaway to stay warm
The block is hot, the Wayne song
The block is hot, the napalm
The block will block ya one shot
Mutombo, you ball on blocks
You get dropped like a fumble lil nigga
That's Free Nation and Pivot
Free my niggas, that's Lincoln ho
From the first all the way to the 15th
Free my niggas, that's lincon heaux
Free my niggas, that's lincon heaux
Free my niggas
