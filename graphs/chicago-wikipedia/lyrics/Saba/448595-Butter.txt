[Hook: Saba (2X)]
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
I got up out of bed this morning feelin' like some butter
Toast up in my toaster or some waffles, boy whatever
Pick my nappy fro but boy I used to have 'em butters
Fuck the niggas that hate, tell 'em everything's great hey
Pardon my parkay
Daily's a parlay
Cause I've been the best for two years now
Tell them dudes sit down I'mma do it how ever the
Fuck I want, fuck you thought?
Where I'm from bitch, that be Austin
You worried 'bout the wrong things, cause money can't buy you love
Or make your dreams come true

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
They hate you
Who cares?
My father told me that the world was mine when I was five
Figured I could never fail in life so why not try?
To think of the impossible and bring that shit to life
Like why I need a job if all this shit already mine?
Steady vibes, and they are the good
Westside nigga, we all the hood
Still managed that honor roll
Still don't live by the books

Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Wake up every wake up everyday feelin' good
Out of town, out of town homies showin love
Bump my new shit for my niggas in the hood
They hate you
Who cares?
