Can't contain who you really are
On my grind like my name was Kareem Campbell
Saw it coming like a lesson planner
Now my agent say we tour planning
I hustle from Monday to Monday
Knew that I would get it some day
I'm from the [?] castle
I hustle like my name was Gary V
I'm Triple H giving a pedigree
I put in the work till I'm dirt in the earth
Or moving furniture to Beverly
Failed a few but I ain't sweating it
[?]
