And I’m from the part of the city that they don’t be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison,
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip
And I’m from the part of the city that they don’t be talking about
Austin my grandmama house
Madhouse on Madison
My head to the sky like a Jesse White backflip
My granny house was right by Wallace’s Catfish
Used to hoop daily we thought we was Jordan
He went on to high school but dropped out a junior
I went on to college he we went on a shooter he went on to juvi
I went out on tour
Bicycle with the juice in the wheel if you was a real nigga
All lost some niggas to some weapons
Thats why I’m walking like I’m welcome
Hennessy bet they’ll buy that
Just to pour it on the curb
Shout the kids claiming Chiraq know you born in the burbs boy
And I'm from the part of the city that they don't be talking about
I gave the west side a new meaning
I took it to the Europeans
And honestly I should’ve reached out to Twista like aye bro I got one I need you on this one
Austin, Division, ironic that that's the divide
Below the poverty line
Proud to throw the westside up when I was five watching Pac dissing Biggie
Whole fit off of Madison eating Uncle Remus fuck a Whole Foods
Shorty used to act like Stone Cold flipping niggas off cracking cold brews
Westside prep was my old school
The block was hot like Suzanne Somers
Seen someone that got hit with a shotty walk a block while he shitted his body
Cops came started lifting his body
I went back to watching NickToons
