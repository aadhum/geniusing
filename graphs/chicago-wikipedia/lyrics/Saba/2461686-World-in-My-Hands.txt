The world in my palm like it's pomade
I swanton bombed
And she say that she saw me on prime time
Stock going up draft combine
3 Man weave just the forwards
I was a diamond in the rough but rough was more literal
Now I kill with the literary, just drop it on em like litterers
I just put my life in some literature...like literally!
I can't hold it, I feel all of it
The police targeted, like I'm shoppin
Still yellin' bitch mob task force (hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey)
In my vans,
Teanna
A town stomp Fuck Trump
St. Lou taught me never front, stunt
Dave Mirra bring it bike on em, they been feeling dead
On a...quest for my lil' niggas
