[Verse 1]
Turn a cheek, poverty, heritage, cotton seed
Squares around the block again
I believe I can fly, "R Kelly", awkwardly
Up the street where they bang, I ain't hang
Out the jam, wap da bam, I'll pretend all our friends still alive
Lord'll see when our dreams get...torn apart
On the tar, left the kid, on your mark
Joan of Arc, genocide, second time, Noah's Ark
Now you're dead, no one saw
"My name's Will Fountain...
Three things off my bucket list:
One, I wanna have a meal from in and out, coz I live nowhere near one
Two, I wanna go one on one against D. Rose
And three, I wanna *fuck* Kylie Jenner"
