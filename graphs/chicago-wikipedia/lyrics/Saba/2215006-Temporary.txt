Castles turn into debris I feel like I've been here before
Shorty took five and lived through it that's more like a miracle
They gon' try to take you down when you get to your pinnacle
If God is greed then by all means
Trade a silver lining for a silver dollar
You'll get in proper with an Impala
It feel like ego gon' turn to C4
And melt this bitch down
Kobe said imma go on tour
Rest in peace my nigga
How we taking shit for granted
When this life is barely even yours
You knocked on heaven's door
And asked them to spare change
They only sparing love
You probably run away
Everything's temporary
And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery
And money so temporary
And poor is so temporary
And new friends so temporary
And so is the cemetery
