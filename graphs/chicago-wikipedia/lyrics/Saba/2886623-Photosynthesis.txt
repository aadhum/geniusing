Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize, or see that the glare is right
And what you compromise, I almost die, I doubt the water is red as mine
Ay, how you lonely in a room with God?
Never slow up, not even a pitstop
Was startin' to be a man, up to the wrist watch
When your stars align, I hope there's no comet
So far it's...
Oh yes, I made it alive, I'm on the West Side, still at my momma house
The kids on my conscience now, coz the youth dying and it's just more common now
Common ground, stuck through it all like we Carmelo
Comin' down, high offa life, arrive unannounced
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognize, or see that the glare is right
And what you compromise, I almost die, I doubt the water is red as mine
I can see the planets from my window sill, and I tend to tell what is honest
I don't wanna fight no one, no contest
I just wanna...undress my conscience
Besides the demons, it's reality for the people that we love
And we are the ones that will team up and tee up the party
The audience awfully ready and rowdy
I meant it if I said it, you get in writing
Got into a science, but write with the lightning
Like soil, I'm grounded, the seed has just sprouted
Oh yes I made it alive, Lake Shore Drive, headed to paradise
In this moment of mine, I can't recognise, or see that the glare is right
And what you compromise, I almost die, I doubt the water is red as mine
Yours truly, Billy Williams
