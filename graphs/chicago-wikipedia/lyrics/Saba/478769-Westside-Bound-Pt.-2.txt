[Intro]
Boodah
On the Westside I'm screamin' fuck KD, fuck 'em
Pivot, Pivot
We don't really give no fuck bout employment
We just wanna chill like Kelso and Forman
I'm from the hood you fucking townie
Your girl she want me I got bounties
And free my nigga up in county
We moving in silence but gonna make the story known
Support it you want me gone take over Napoleon
Grinding so hard I bet my momma (proud)
Stomp imma stomp like Kirk in a church (gown)
Rap fictitious, classmates dissing
Change the next day and now it's classmates wishing
For kisses like PDA
Stand on thin line like YouMedia
Came a long way since them hard ways
Now prolly sell out the venue if it's all age
And prolly like everyday holiday no off days
City behind me like a predecessor better catch up know who next up
Better them them bitch it's our time
With them X's on your hand at the entrance ay?
Superhero shit the black (Finn & Jake)
Adventure Time
Ridin' like I fell in love
Separate, come back and then regroup
Looking out the window
I swear everything's a blur we just be cool
Griding so hard I bet my father (smile)
Looking at his son like my nigga you are (bound)
To be the next one to make it (out)
Chi is defined by the violence
Lifeless lives loss I've seem to lost (count)
