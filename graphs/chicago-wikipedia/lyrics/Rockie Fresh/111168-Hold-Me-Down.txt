[Intro]
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down

[Bridge]
Say you get lonely, ride around the town
A lot of funny hoes be comin round
I need a bad bitch to hold me down
I need a bad bitch to hold me down

[Hook]
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Hold me down, hold me down
Yea, you hold me down and I may someday love you
It ain’t nothing wrong with a rich nigga
Just take a look at what this shit gets you
I’m a big dreamer and a big spender
And every time I’m in your friend you get that big picture
You a smart girl, dumb ass
but you got your own cash
You ain’t known to cut class,
you ain’t known to fuck fast
A real nigga, ain’t nothing like these clowns
