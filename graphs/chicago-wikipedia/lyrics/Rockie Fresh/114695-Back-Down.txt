Chi-Town nigga, stepping on the scene
Catch me standing tall I don't really fuck with lean
I'm known to make them get money anthems for the team
But they still got a message like an answering machine
Shawty I'll fulfill your dreams, These other dudes sleep
And call me up at night, I be getting hella D
everyday we hustlin'
My chick thick, real shit no fluffin
Shit, control em' like 2k, or whatever you play
All of that drama, I make her have to chill on it
say them other dudes sweet
Martin Lawrence on blue streak
And I smash her every morning guess I'm really up and coming
