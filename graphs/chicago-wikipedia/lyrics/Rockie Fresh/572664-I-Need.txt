[Hook: Sample]
I need, sunshine
I need, angels
I need... something good, yeah
I need, blue skies
I need, them old times
I need... something good, yeah, something good
Something good, yeah, something good
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Woh Oh Oh
Try to put your lifestyle in this perspective
Every mornin' wakin' up to get McDonald's breakfast
And I'll hop into whatever whip my homies drive
Not on the bus out of pride so I gotta ride
Teachers talkin' 'bout potential that I don't apply
But fuck school, I want vacations on the other side
I get the cake, take a break, then I self divide
I hear 'em talkin' but I'm winnin' so I let it slide
I pray for niggas sayin' that I ain't shit
Cause I too once had to work the late shift
Moving boxes had the young boy back in pain
A slave work that I would do for this paper chase
Now I'm gettin' money, they say I should style more
Dance on 'em, pop bottles, nigga smile more
Truth be told,  though I feel like I ain't done much
I think I need some more time and some more blunts
Understand me, I want more for my family
Don't matter what they hand me, I'mma turn it to gold
