Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it
Say we about it, we really be about it
A nigga say he get it like me, I doubt it
All about that money man, I can’t leave home without it
And we talking ‘cause we live it, yeah we really be about it
Say we about it, tell ‘em we about it
I’m committed to commission, I collect it, then I count it
And a lot of niggas down it but it’s what the bitches down with
Looking for that next up out the Chi, think you found it
And you can keep on searching but won’t find no nigga realer
Just bought me a new Audi, pulled it fresh up out the dealer
Now your ho be trying to roll ‘cause I’m fly and smoke and kill her
Plus my chain be black and yellow, not from Pittsburgh but I Steeler
And I'm macking
Got the fans waving
every show will make you sea sick
Blood season niggas salty ‘cause my pockets deep bitch
Hating on me, all seven days on some weak shit
We get whatever you want, know Rockie got ya
I’m the truth, these niggas lions just like Mufasa
Show stopper
so proper in that Baping shit
I got it early while you niggas on the waiting list
We love risk so it’s only right we respect hustlers
We will like hate haters and we check lovers
Man, I’m walking on these niggas, they my step brothers
She with me, she smoke for free, y’all do them expensive dates
Pull up in that old school, bitch, I think I’m Vince Vaughn
