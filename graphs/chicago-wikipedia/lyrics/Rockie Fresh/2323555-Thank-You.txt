I watched Biggie, I watched Pac, I watched Pimp C
Hating when you sitting in front of God like you, DJ Envy
I had Breakfast Club meetings with my brother Rickie
And if you think he tried to change me, you fucking crazy
And Balmain and bape on me, this ain't nothing new
But I ain't trippin' cause it don't make me better than you
My 100s Blue Devil on me like I play for Duke
Now I'm smoked out with these two chicks on me
He like pears so I passed it to the big homie
They say you only get remembered when you got a name
7 others died with Aaliyah on the plane
I don't know nobody else, should them niggas feel the shame
