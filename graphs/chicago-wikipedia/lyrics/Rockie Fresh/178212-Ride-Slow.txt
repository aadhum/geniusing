I've been working all day, waiting for tonight
Roll my first blunt now I'm feeling right
Jamo in my cup, let's turn up tonight
Bitches trying to fuck, let's turn up tonight
Them bitch niggas I'm not 'em
I got my money right ain't got no problems
Seen the sun go down, see your bitch go down
Seen my money go up, make sure my shit don't go down
Nah, shit I work better when I'm under pressure
Got a problem how I do it bitch?, Do it better
Nah never never, I heard that never never
Substract where I'm at and bitch you see the sweater
Killed this shit it's on a stretcher
