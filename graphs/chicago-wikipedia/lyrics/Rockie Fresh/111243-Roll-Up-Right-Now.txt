I went from sleeping on the twin to nights with the Olsens
I know I'm the dopest, though my city seem hopeless
Lot of people don't make it, lot of niggas be faking
Lot of niggas be dying so my main goal is surviving
In the town I'm residing, grinding until I'm resigning
Copping kicks for the team, make sure my people stay clean
Alexander McQueen
It's rocking like the Rolling Stones, she see me in the Rolling Stones
Blowing money fast, we ain't saving it
Blowing loud in the crib bout to do it big
Roll up right now, roll up right now
Get so high I touch a cloud, roll up right now
Roll up right now, roll up right now
Get some loud and break it down, roll up right now
I'm riding in some shit only I can design
Old school though so ahead of my time
With every line that I drop, every fashion line that I rock
These niggas is catching up late, reset they clocks
Stripes on the dodge viper
