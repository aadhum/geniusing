Young Superman OG
Double M-G
the hottest since the R-O-C
I've got my niggas rollin', wonderin' what the plan gon' be
Y'all gon' watch me turn water into a billion
Stack it to the heavens, leave a blessing for the children
I'mma be the reason why my grandkids say "we've got family money"
Made a cool mill', yet I'm still the young and hungry
I grind with the mastermind, the gifted, the dreamchaser
'Til you've seen us, you ain't seen paper
My nigga Stalley album 'bout to hit the scene, later
And Gunplay 'bout that action when he see haters
Me I blow vapors, Swishers, bongs, whatever
What I spent on luggage could've bought your ass a fiat
Made $10,000, spent it all on kicks
And you ain't gettin' high like this
You ain't ridin' in no rides like this
This shit feelin' like a nigga standin' high at the top of the world
