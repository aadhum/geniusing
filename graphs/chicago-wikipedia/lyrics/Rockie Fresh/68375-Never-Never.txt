[Hook]
Okay, it's Rockie checking in, I'm loving what I got
I'm about to run the game until this muh'fucker drops
Plus my flow a lil dirty, I suggest you bring a mop
If I die today and this should ever be the end of me
I'm grateful for the things that I've already begin to see
From sold out stages
Not even twenty-one when I shut down Vegas
An independent nigga getting love from hella majors
And I did it own my own, ain't down with taking favors
I am self-taught (God made)
If you say you got a gift, make them appreciate your presence
Okay they thought that I would fail, they only see me making it
Even when I chill, I'm getting more dough than they can get
Yeah, I'm in the game but, I never really play for shit
Kwame Brown money niggas saying, "I get paid to sit"
And we smoking on good, fuck them bad vibes
And all of my niggas fresh men, like the Fab Five
We don't put the time out, they just put the time in
All the old heads fuck with me like Kangol
Driving 88, I'm riding out
