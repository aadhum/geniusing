I’m rolling up, I’m twisting up
I’m lighting up
Got my mind on the place I came
And I promised to never change
And these haters just keep calling
I don’t answer, they keep calling
I said fuck it, I keep balling
So just holla if you need something
I said holla if you need something
You never know, you never know, you never know
See when the night goes, see when the lights glow
Staying patient tryna get it right
These niggas talkin they ain't living right
These niggas talkin, you keep living life
