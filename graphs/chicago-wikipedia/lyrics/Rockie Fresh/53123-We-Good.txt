I got the game locking like a fence, they trying to pick it
Got the bitches driving reckless, just to say they got a ticket
How'd I make my firework, it’s feeling like the 4th again
You see that we running shit, bank is like my end zone
And we love this money getting, we can’t let the hate affect us
