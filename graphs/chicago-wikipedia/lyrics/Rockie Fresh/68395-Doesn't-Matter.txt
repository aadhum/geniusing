[Hook 1]
From the top of the first page
To the end of the last day
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
From the bottom to the top floor, and I'm trying to make it further
Doing shit you never heard of, taking my city to a different place
I'm going up with my eyes low wack cuz I've been smoking
Told them I would do it, but they thought that I was joking
Now I'm on
And I ain't listening to what you say
Nigga, you a hater, don't even talk to me
This road that I have chosen, I'm happy so I'm speeding down it
I know how to handle that money simply cause I be around it
Put an arrow in your heart like cupid
New 3's
Bape tees
Is there anybody out there who
Is lost and hurt and lonely too
Are they bleeding all your colours into one?
And if you come undone
As if you've been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
Or if you're stuck in square one
