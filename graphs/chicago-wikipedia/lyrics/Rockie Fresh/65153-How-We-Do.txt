Im about to be the king tell them boys give me the crown
Soundin just like Avril saying "I'm so complicated"
no groceries but im baggin hoes
Little nigga in double XL and I ain't talking baggy clothes
These niggas no these bitches no there will be no equal
Im gettin paid I gotta it made my homie you know how we do
Break bread with my people
These hoes are evil
We do not need you
Chop it up on 3 phones
Eyes light off emerald
Bad as Billy Jean you should improve
Top and bottom from the hottest hotties then kick em' out like the rent's due
They can't dream what i've been through
Still I make it look simple
Fresh as Rockie,
got the heffers jocking
