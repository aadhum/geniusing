It's only one I(eye) like a pirate
And I ain't even tripping 'bout the music people pirate
Cause I know when I drop my shit everybody gon' buy it
Why? Because they like it, yup, yup, they love it, they admire it
Wish a nigga would so I'd have more to start my fire with
Never trust these hoes, cause they try to put me out
Everybody want me booked, so I guess they feel my story
And the only time I fail, is when I fail to lose
like King with a dream
Visibly rise like DeRozan with the lyrical
Now the pretty girls waving like the Vikings did to Moss
Getting buffalo bills at how its spitting for the bison
