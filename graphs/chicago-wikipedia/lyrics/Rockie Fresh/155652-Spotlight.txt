Cause I remember when, these people didn’t get me
When girls would turn me down and go the extra mile to diss me
I never came around and I swear nobody miss me
And I used to be alone, now everybody fuckin’ wit me
And them same ole niggas wanna kick it now
They used to call me lame now they appreciate my style
