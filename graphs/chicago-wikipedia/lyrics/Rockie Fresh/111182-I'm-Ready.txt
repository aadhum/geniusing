Follow me to the sun
I'm ready, so ready, are you ready?
For whatever may come
Cause I'm ready, born ready, so ready
For whatever may come
I've been waiting for it
Staying patient for it
I just can't ignore it, no I can't ignore it
I've been waiting for it
Staying patient for it
Nah I can't ignore it, I just can't ignore it
We doing everything just to see the same
If they change us then how could we ever gonna change the game
I'm growing, its showing
This goes one way
They gonna know some day
They gonna know some day
