Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her
Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her
Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her
Twisting up my blunt thinking about my next dollar
Getting in the game trying to get some money out her
Gotta know a nigga stay fresh for real
This young gun is not in the army but they do say a nigga is dress to kill
You ain't moving with my movement then get the fuck around
Rockie Fresh is world renown
So many hoes I don't know who to pick
And they ain't even going off what I got but they see what I'm about to get
But I do know one thing though
Women and men are hoes
Niggas here through Sunday Monday but soon they'll be expose
Maybe they'll love me one day, maybe they'll let it show
Until then I'll just keep rocking all these shoes and clothes
Cause I be on some fly shit but bets believe this nigga is not the one
Get a lot of head got these hoes going dumb
Since I been on track others rappers on the run
Got a little change and I got a little fame
But all real niggas gonna feel this at the end of the day when they see that we the same
The kid on point like I'm playing for the Mavericks
Fresh to death like I rap in caskets
But the boy is so alive
Cause this Ros√© got me nodding
