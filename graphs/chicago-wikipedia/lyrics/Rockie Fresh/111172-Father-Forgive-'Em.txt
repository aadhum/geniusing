Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Father forgive em for these niggas know not what they do
Feeling like my nigga Meek, these dreams the only thing I chase
my blunt bangin like a 808
Shit can make Usain Bolt feel out of shape
Ricky love the fans, you just see he dropped another tape
buying out all the Bape
Mercy me, I could’ve did better on that mercy beat
But still pushed the mercy when I travel through Miami streets
My team is on a winning streak, we the ones to beat
My chick thick and my clique full of young kings
The word around is we looking like The Dream-Team
The word around is we looking like The Dream-Team
That all-gold Rollie and diamonds in the bezel
And ever since we touch the riches we won’t never let go
