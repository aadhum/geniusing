Got the power to be me, even though my style may vary
So I always took a chance, and now I'm becoming legendary
Got the broke niggas hatin', the weak niggas hatin'
The weak bitches hatin', but we just tryna make it
They see a sea full of riches, and they just can't dive
They just stay dry and wave shells on guys
While I realize that a lot of people be tweaking
And it's sad to see 'em starve, but it ain't our fault they ain't eatin'
I been on the grind, ain't have time for one fade in four months
Evan Williams, Biz Stone, Jack Dorsey
Them the type of people that are role
Models for me
