Yeah, I'm in a fly T and a denim jacket, if I want it I can have it
I'll be getting girls with magic, I ain't gotta swipe my plastic
Yeah, being me is such a habit
I ain't never fronting, so the people back it
I treat my women right, they be coming back
When they start talking wife, then I'm done with that
I know you're fresher than the next bitch, that's with ease
I see you looking at the exit, so let's leave
And don't feel you're ever reckless, there's no need
Just know you'll always be respected, by me
Could you blame me for feeling like the one
Shining hard, all these other niggas here is ?
? they couldn't get a job at Papa John's
Switch it up, now we doing things on the Jacksons
