[Instrumental]
Yea, I hit the door, you ain’t drop the towel
Fuckin on the hunnids, girl collect the pow
You know you look good in your dickie style
I’m drivin 88
You ever had balenciaga shoes and bags
You know this shit with the commas on the tag
Let me know if you can fuck with that
The tattoo that only show when you’re topless
Might be tattooed in my conscious
You telling me your ex, nigga gay you promise
You ain’t got a caller
If you show me something you can get it back
Can you show me the things I never saw?
Then prove the lies that he used to talk
