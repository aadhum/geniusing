I gotta make it to the other side, where the grass is much greener
What I don't have is swag, this is just my demeanor
And I swear that dirty money's the thing that's keeping me cleaner
That'll get me out the jam into a jam-packed arena
Entering through the back door, they know to keep they trap closed
I swear if y'all could just spend a day in these zappos
To make it to the top you can’t usually be unusual
I’m way too out the box, I could never work in them cubicles
[Hook]
Man, it’s important to be absorbent when advice is given
An old head talking? I suggest you listen
I swear you niggas could get paid if you pay attention
Serial killing tracks bitch, I’m the captain of crunch time
I’m tangled in my grind but that kush is helping me unwind
They broken, I’m the cast, so surprised that I’m unsigned
But my time will come, I will never stop believing
I will never stop my drive, from the day I put the keys in
Never rush or nothing, I’m just waiting on my season
Since I got up in this bitch, I swear I never plan on leavin’
I can’t wait ‘till a couple mill is just a parking ticket
On this road to riches
We knew that I would blow, ‘cause I had a flow like a fountain
Now we on, yeah we on, led to the top of a mountain
