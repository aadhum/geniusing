The lights will lead you there
There’s no better life than this, I swear
Y’all wonder how I got here
Lil nigga fuck around and had a big year
You know the smoke got it cloudy, but one things clear
That when them lights go down I have no fear
No I ain’t afraid of nothing
Got a lot now but I got some more coming
Coming from the city where the choppas steady drumming
And everybody wonder how I get to where I’m gunning, well...
Way before the watch and chain
Way before they knew my name
Way before all this fame
Way before the cars that came
I didn’t really care who fuck with it
I always wanted money, I’mma go and get it
You wit it, I’m wit it, you're bitch gon let me hit it
She wit it, I’m wit it, down
But a nigga so gone
More dough than your pop’s got
Thankful for everything that I’ve got
Damn, I really got my breakthrough
This what happen when you grind and stay faithful
Everything you’re not is the shit that make you
Just watch for the lights that glow, yeah
