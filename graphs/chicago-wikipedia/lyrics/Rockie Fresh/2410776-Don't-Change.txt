I met you a few years back and you still one hundred
And one hundred percent of the time
You should know you gon' be good if you're mine
lying and he blocking your shine
(Sample)
know you got work and you're dealing with classes
And most men that you meet are to immature
And they can't handle your passion
(Sample)
