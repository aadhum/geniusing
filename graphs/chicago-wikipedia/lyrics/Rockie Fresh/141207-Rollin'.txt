My old girl went M.I.A., so I'mma see what this new bitch 'bout
we gon' chill she gettin' shocked by the electric feel
No name droppin' I hate lying,
To the future like Marty, still driving 88
But this fit for two so leave your friends we ain't got no room
Ballin' with my niggas, while we travel state to state
Roll up with no tint, my old school is so mint
Score like I own the gym, your team so 0 for 10
All my hoes be OPM, they let me fuck, they don't pay rent
I pay her bills with no regret, bitch must not know me yet
I'm that type that hop that flight, you say I can rip tonight
Girl drop that Sebring, upgrade them bee stings
C cup, D cup, new closet, she needs things
Pushin' on that cushion now, rotate, push rewind
