I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
I don't know what this kush do, but I think of you when I get high
You told me that your nigga trippin', y'all don't even speak
You ain't had sex in seven days, this ain't your fuckin' week
You want someone that you can keep and not someone that creep
