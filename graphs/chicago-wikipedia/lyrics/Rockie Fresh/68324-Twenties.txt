When I was just a young'un I had dreams of riding twenties
Better than expected, we ain't locked up doing twenty
Counting hella twenties, counting hella twenties
I was playing 2K and beat a nigga by twenty
Chilling with the vets, even though I'm still a rookie
Got a lot of living left, trying to get it in my twenties
Rockie Fresh is still the truth, when they doubt I show 'em proof
Started at the flow, then my flow took me through the roof
Put money into my future, could've bought a coupe
And now Nike gave me shoes, and I ain't got a hoop
A lot of people always ask me how I did this
I tell 'em I work hard, then I try to mind my business
And I burn a lot of trees,
but I never burn bridges
And the reason I be smoking, cause some shit blow me to no end
Bape army, I'm a troop
stepping hard like a Nupe
Losers not in my crew,
little homie you can scoop
You ain't talking money then you might as well be put on mute
And I'm too focused, I can't even see no confrontation
Now they put me in the basement, I'm so high so I ain't with it
That is no place for the young, fly, and gifted
And when I was a shawty that's how I thought I would get it
Started as a dream, now I really get to live it
