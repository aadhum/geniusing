Yeah see I done  seen niggas go broke
Trying hard to be cool, chasing the thrills
Then they get behind on they bills
This a message to the kids
Growing up, it's real
Shout out everyone i'm cool with
Everybody I went to school with
Every person I ever worked with
Even people I went to church with
Got high, blew the loud, rolled the purp with
Every bitch I chilled on the surf with
Since you make my life better
Now a young nigga ready for whatever
