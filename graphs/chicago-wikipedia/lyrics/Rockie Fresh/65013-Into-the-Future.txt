I tell my niggas
Anything is possible
impossible is nothing
I know this shit can get better
Workin' hard, tryna put myself together
Finna hit the jackpot, I got my hand on the lever
New condo, walk in, 6 rooms
Feelin' good but that shit got a sick view
You don't think I'm Uno, skip you
You ain't got it like me, cause your bitch do
This train wreck that we inhale
Got me feelin' unstoppable like Denzel
Anyone, make a nigga get more bucks, more gold, more hoes
Throw the De Lorean doors up
Pretty chick watching me hop out
You're fucked!
Man, these wild girls love chill
Like these fake niggas love real
But hated at the very same time
They say ain't fucking with it
So they trippin online
These nigga pay for pussy
I'm just tryna pay dues
