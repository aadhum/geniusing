crib like King of Diamonds
You can catch me wearing
(two chains)
freshgoods
making sure them checks good
Gotta feed the homies, real players with respect would
These flashing lights is blinding, go get them a visor
Call the beat a gas leak and I set this shit on fire
And I don't fuck with liars, only tell the truth
Honesty is key and that is in and out the booth
Ball while they in the bleachers, so high they can't reach us
I dropped out of college and made more dough than my teachers
Definition of swagging, all off of my passion
Now while in deep thought, when I was high
Thought about the time that I
Wasn't picked to be a leader in the Chi
out the jam
People I ain't know trying to say they my fam
They see the jewels and they try to play Cam
Tell em they can dip if they ain't running with the set
And if you got money you can go and place a bet
I'll be in the sky cause riding on the jet
Rolling up the wet,
I'm never getting seen
Because I got a name and a brand to protect
And all I ask for the people is respect
In return they're gon' get the same thing
They took a young player from the Chi off the bench
Now they're about to watch the whole game change
Remember my name, and understand that I'm a go-getter
Money maker, made a promise, I can't be no broke nigga
That would be a let-down, like unraveling a broke swisher
Me and success is a gold picture, you on the same then I fuck witcha
Yeah Rockie on a roll
Makin hella dough
