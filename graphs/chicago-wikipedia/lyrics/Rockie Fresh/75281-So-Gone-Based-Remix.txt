Twisting up a blunt, thinking about my next dollar
riding up in her
Young Based God
Straight West Coasting
But I do know one thing though, women and men are hoes
Niggas here through Sunday, Monday but soon they'll be exposed
Maybe they'll love me one day, maybe they'll let it show
Until then, I'll just keep on rocking all these shoes and clothes
she too ratchet
The kid is on point like Iâ€™m playing for the Mavericks
