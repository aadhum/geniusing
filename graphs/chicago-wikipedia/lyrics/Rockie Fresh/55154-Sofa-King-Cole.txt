I ain’t come in a ford
But I’m definitely in my focus
A lot of women battle to see who can get the closest
And maybe I crossed the line, so I guess the flags on encroachment
However I stay chilling, right where I’m supposed to be
Shout out to the most highest, clear that he has chosen me
And they say money changes, so I hope these people notice me!
Hopefully they will learn to chill with all that whack shit
I see ‘em hangin’ with them squares like Patrick
So they quick to give me props, like a stage hand
I’m not a butler but I’m certainly a made man
But I choose to focus on the love that I receive
Since I done been on my grid, niggers got left behind
Now they see that I’m ahead, and expect me to rewind
Them niggers are really out, but they hate just like Uncle Ruckus
And Clyton Bigsby
Own that other crib, they just a house guest, Sinbad
