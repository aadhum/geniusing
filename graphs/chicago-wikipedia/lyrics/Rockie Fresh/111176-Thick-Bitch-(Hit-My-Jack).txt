She been grinding long time to get to where she at
Little mama put in work
And she lookin real right in that pencil skirt
She get on my shit and then she go berserk
I’m a fresh nigga even when I do my dirt
Thick bitch hit my jack
She know that I’m everything these niggas lack
I might throw a hundred if you throw it back, so throw it back
You can stop if you want these stacks
You know it’s a party everywhere we at
Like a slow jam go and throw it back
You, you and your friend go and throw it back, throw it back
Now she don’t drink, but she say she might do that tonight
She don’t smoke but she say she might do that tonight
Have you ever really rolled in them Porsches or them Bentleys?
Hey Rockie, I kinda figured you wouldn’t answer
One of your videos just popped up on my TV screen
And I really wish you was standing right here in front of me
But you’re always so busy, you’re always on tour
And niggas out here notice that, they always tryna get at me
But I ain’t never going ‘cause I know you will come back for me
But if you find the time give me a call back
It’s your Chicago girl, bye
