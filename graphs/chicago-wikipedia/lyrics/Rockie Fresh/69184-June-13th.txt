Its hard knowing my intelligence
Even though im becoming stupid rich
Always getting brain im never fucking with a stupid bitch
Im always the roll just like a drummer doing rudiments
You’ll find shes hard to hit like a half court shot
Nigga your future couldn’t even conquer my past
Me and success gotta chemistry they ain't teach us in class
Got the formula without using a beaker or flask
Its all part of the math
I never give em titles just like lebron or mcnabb
No matter how much they worth
Or the talents that show they have
Im out here making hits
And these niggas ain't even bunting
And he cope em by the dozen they ain't getting any cheaper
Focused on forward motion I ain't with that back tracking
