These informants, pockets enormous
Rockie keep tourin',
Rocky Balboa, how I beat boys
All she want is me so
Sushi feed her ego
Flippin falcons got my house bigger than Atlanta
Panera bread
Man these niggas hatin', they can't make it out they mama house
The least that they can do is wash the dishes, take the garbage out
See the way I'm rollin', now they questionin' the different route
See the young'n flexin', I ain't have to pull a muscle out
I'm in another market,
tracks with Good Charlotte
These rappers are lethargic, I always hit my target
She love to hit the beach and she love to watch Scandal
I'm smokin' in her crib and she prefer I light candles
She worried 'bout the scent, while I'm focused on the rent
She said I should have been number one on that freshman list
I told her it was nothin' to me, girl don't stress that shit
Plus some of my niggas on it, I respect that shit
Although they did forget Casey, and he say life changes
Always been more than a player, I am Thibodeau
I know the flow, I'm such a coach, to get the win is my approach
Salute Kanye, that's my city, Jordan
Some niggas say they D-Rose, but who really scorin'?
Who signin' endorsements, Satan or them corporates?
Ball so hard they tore shit
Shit I ball so hard I make 'em wanna forfeit
It's all natural, I ain't even gotta force shit
Force shit, since a young'n, I would always be good
Got that broccoli cheddar soup with that Panera bread
