Yea, I got so much to figure out
All because a nigga went and chose a different route
I got one life, I gotta make it count
I guess I’ll spend it tryna get it with these large amounts
People still wonder how I did it
I am the future, look at what I’ve invented
DeLorens
Lambos, yea I can whip it
My swag might have me like I need some bitches
Y’all niggas don’t get it, y’all settle for second
That Givency look nice but who you think you impressing
I followed my intuition,
never paid that tuition
The Holy Ghost
Heaven high
I got credits on my records
If money ain’t the object, what the fuck is your objective?
