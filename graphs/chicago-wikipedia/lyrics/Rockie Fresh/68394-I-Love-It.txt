I'm lost inside this rock and roll
some things I don't need to say
Organized greatness, I can't live my life in disarray
doobie in my right hand
Some may say I'm wildin' out, but I'm just living life, man
Every day's a work day, but every night's exciting
Point, I get remembered like the Titans
And I come from the other side, lot of fans, lot of pride
People tell me life's a trip
A risk there's reward, you shoot you can score
From the Chi to NY, I fucking love it
From LA to VA, I fucking love it
From ATL to San Fran, I fucking love it
I'm living like the dam man, I fucking love it
From Toronto to UK, I fucking love it
From Australia to Norway, I fucking love it
And I get to do it my way, I fucking love it
I don't even care what y'all say, I fucking love it
