Yeah, Obama made me believe I had a chance to rule
Listen to Lupe and a nigga tried to chase the Cool
And Kanye made me wanna go and drop out of school
And just because it’s meant for me don’t mean it’s meant for you
Like go to college, get a education, see it through
I know they say that the rappers get all the hoes
But don’t get it twisted, doctors and lawyers get bitches too
Hov wrote the blueprint, niggas like me studied it
Swung up off my manager
And a couple white chicks, feeling like the Wayans brothers
