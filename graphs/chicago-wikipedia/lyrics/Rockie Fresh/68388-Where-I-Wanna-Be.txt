Okay, it's Rockie checking in, also known for killing shit
Ain't got a deck of cards but y'all know who you dealing with
Music is my weapon and I swear I'm not concealing it
And women wanna touch me to symbolize they're feeling it
Young James Bond got these bitches roaming over
Getting pussy galore
Then they come all for my crown and try to throw me over
Adventure to the future,
bitch I think I'm Emmett Brown
And stack every dollar to the ceiling, straight building
White hoes, black hoes, we all mixed up
Hating on us, that's the shit that get your bitch fucked
Magazines and legs spreads
Where I wanna be: 30,000 feet up
Fuck 'em in the back of the building, I get that alley cat
My pockets looking like I don't know where a Bally's at
Don't F with me, I'm only fucking with G's now
