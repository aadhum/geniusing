Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You can make it to it
All of y'all can make it too
A nigga like me, yeah I made it through
Uh, okay and all of y'all can make it too
Okay now love to all the teachers that said I wouldn't be shit
Love to local rappers that said I wouldn't be shit
Love to all the girls that took my kindness for a weakness
I made it through the pain, all of y'all deserve to see this
Just a young nigga from Homewood that started thinking forward
Was known for all that fly shit and those fresh clothes that I sported
And love to those that saw my dreams and went out and supported
I made it on the road, my school mission was aborted
And no one tryna stop birth, but understand my plan b
To make everybody in this world understand me
See me and all my niggas used to roll in a Camry
And now we make them 2012 Benz start hands-free
And that is not for stunting, but to show you you can improve
We all got things to get through, we all dreams to get to
We all gon' have some problems, going through a couple issues
But when we make it out, always say this in your mental
I'mma live it like I never had nothing before
And I'mma stack it like I never had money before
'Cuz I came at the bottom, remained at the bottom
And now I'm at the top, so I'm waving at the bottom
So long, so long, so long, so long
