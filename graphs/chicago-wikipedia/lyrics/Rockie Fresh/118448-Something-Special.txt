It's bout doing the unthinkable
I definitely brought the bars
Life is way more than these pretty chicks and fancy cars
Like a young Jamie Foxx I'm breaking all the rules
I done made the kind of music where I never go away
88 was on the dash
Hitting Fendi, I got more belts the Kevin Nash
Them Jordan Boxes is where I'm known to keep the stash
But the shoes ain't never in 'em cause they always on the gas
Like when I use to be in Roseland playing little league
Hitting River Oaks
The money that I'm getting make them think I'm selling coke
Stand behind my bars like I'm bout to do a bid
Road to Perdition like Paul I'm a new man
All the real niggas looking at me like I'm true fam
I mostly wear Jordans but I might fuck with Reebok
I use to push a dolly looking goofy in the lobby
And now I'm getting money like I invented mollies
Few niggas in my league like I was playing hockey
