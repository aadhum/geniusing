You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
Here it is raw form
Takin' my time makin' hits different from the norm
My flow is fire my game's way ahead of my time
I make moves outside the lines
You know your boy's tryna show you the new model
I'm in my zone goin' full throttle
You wanna grow up then put up that bottle
It's time to see some of my kids rise up
It's game time who gone show up clutch?
I went from good to great, lukewarm to hot
I'm on top and I can't be stopped
You know they love it when they see ya fall
So kick it
head, give it
[Hook]
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
I see those people they be stylin', wylin'
Social profilin'
in the middle of an opportunity
And I was the master
[Hook]
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
[Hook]
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
You thinkin' that you a king boy
But I'mma get to it to
Anything that you do I can do better than you
