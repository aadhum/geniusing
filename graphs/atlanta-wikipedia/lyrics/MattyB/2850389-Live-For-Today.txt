[Hook]
They say that we reckless
They say we can’t do it our own way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
They love to have no fun (no fun)
We love to make stops along the way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
Now if ya with me say Oh
And if ya with me say Oh
Couple billion in now er’body think they rap
(ha!)
Started up a label now I’m putting all of my friends on
They say that we reckless
They say we can’t do it our own way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
They love to have no fun
We love to make stops along the way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
Now if ya with me say oh
And if ya with me say oh
They say that we reckless
They say we can’t do it our own way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
They love to have no fun (no fun)
We love to make stops along the way
They can’t promise tomorrow
So let’s live for today
Now if ya with me say oh
And if ya with me say oh
