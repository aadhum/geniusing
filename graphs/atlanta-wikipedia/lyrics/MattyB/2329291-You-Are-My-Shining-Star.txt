You are my shining star, don't you go away
Oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are til my dying days
Oh baby
You hear about some people who even met as kids
They start as friends but then somehow it never ends
It turns to something special, somethin' like what we have
I wonder if one day we'll be those people sayin' that
And you laugh when I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I'm here we can chill and just talk for a while
(I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm)
You are my shining star, don't you go away
Oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are til my dying days
Oh baby
And you laugh when I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I'm here we can chill and just talk for a while
(I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm)
You are my shining star, don't you go away
Oh baby
Wanna be right here where you are til my dying days
Oh baby
And you laugh when I laugh
And I smile when you smile
And I'm here we can chill and just talk for a while
(I never knew that I could feel this strong
And I just need you here under my arm)
