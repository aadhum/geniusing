Mr. Nice Guy
They say I'm too young | For my silver tongue
Let the beat build | You ain't gotta dance
I'm just tired of everybody sitting on their hands
Bend your elbows | look around the room then stop
Now make your hands clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
