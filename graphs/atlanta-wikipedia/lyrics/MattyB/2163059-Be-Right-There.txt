If you need me just say yo
Can I see you, I'll say fa sho
I'mma be right there, I'm be right there
If you need me you can call
I won't hesitate at all
I'mma be right there, I'm be be be be
Be with the homies just chillin after school
Can I be the one who keeps you laughing 'till your face is sore
If you ever need a shoulder to cry on
Well you can cry on mine like anytime you want
Or if you need a place to stay
Well just consider my house like a second home fa sho!
I'mma be there in a second, I'mma be there on the dot
I'mma ride my bike so fast, I might get stopped by the cops!
I could keep it on the low
Tell me all your secrets
I won't let nobody know
If you wanna call me and talk
Give me twenty minutes I'mma meet ya at the park
Cause I can keep it on the low
Tell me all your dreams ain't nobody gotta know
So put your hands up high
This is how it feels to have a friend for life
