They live in the better house, and they wear the cooler clothes
They get everything they want and people like all of their posts
Get to go wherever whenever they want with all their friends
Cause they got the coolest parents
And yours just don’t understand
How you ever ‘sposed ta be one of the popular kids
But what’s inside of you is beautiful, yeah, through and through
