[Hook]
Take my hand, I’ll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We’re screaming hey
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We’re screaming hey
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town
Where we young and we hungry, us kids don’t play
And I rep for the city that I come from
ATL I was born and raised
And I talk that talk
Cause I walk that walk
I was taught to work hard get paid
Spit wild freestyles on the playground
While making mad girls look my way
So hey, whatcha know bout young man
With a plan to make a new way
Through breaking every obstacle thrown in his way
Can’t touch what you can’t see but us the new kids, we be
Better put that pen to the pad
And scribble out your thoughts till your fingers bleed

Take my hand, I’ll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We’re screaming hey
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We’re screaming hey
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town
[Hook]
Take my hand, I’ll show you where we play
Where rules are bent this is our getaway
We’re screaming hey
The future is now go ahead and get loud
We’re screaming hey
The new kids around, cause this is our town
Our town, our town
