She dances in my head all day
The music to my melody
She got me spending all my time
Never thought that I would say the girl is mine
She got me feeling so excited
So deep in love that I can't hide it
[Hook]
Aye shawty come around my way
Cause I just wanna be the one to make you say
The moment I laid my eyes on you
Never knew that I'd be rollin with you
Cause girl you got me hooked on you
Everything that you do
You got me hooked on
I can't help it
You make me get a little crazy
I'm spending all my time with you
Cause oohhh
You got me hooked on you
You got me hooked on you
She makes me feel like I'm 'gon pop
Like taking a trip down to the candy shop
I like the way she don't care
Song comes on got our hands in the air
She makes me feel like I can do it
Together there ain't nothin' to it
[Hook]
Aye shawty come around my way
Cause I just wanna be the one to make you say
The moment I laid my eyes on you
Never knew that I'd be rollin with you
Cause girl you got me hooked on you
Everything that you do
You got me hooked on
I can't help it
You make me get a little crazy
I'm spending all my time with you
Cause oohhh
You got me hooked on you
You got me hooked on you
All I wanna do is have some fun
Me and you make it number one
Every time I hear the song break down
All I think about is you right now
[Hook]
Aye shawty come around my way
Cause I just wanna be the one to make you say
The moment I laid my eyes on you
Never knew that I'd be rollin with you
Cause girl you got me hooked on you
Everything that you do
You got me hooked on
I can't help it
You make me get a little crazy
I'm spending all my time with you
Cause oohhh
You got me hooked on you
You got me hooked on you
