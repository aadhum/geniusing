I’m from down south where we always got sunshine
They say you can’t be a light if it wasn’t for the dark side
Some days you gotta smile through all the broken times
It’ll all be fine, It’s all in your mind, oh yeah
We were paralyzed by fear, now we more than kids,
we up
no
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Sometimes I’ll get home from school and see people on the news
Somebody’s brother - POW - There goes another
wake
up
