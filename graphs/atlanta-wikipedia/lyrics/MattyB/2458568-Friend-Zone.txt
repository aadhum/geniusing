MattyB: So I was thinking maybe we could be more than just friends…
Gracie: You mean like best friends?
Gracie: You mean like MEGA best friends!?
I think we could be
Something more than
Gracie: “just good friends?
But she's got me beat
If you make your move
Gracie: “but we’re best friends”
Lemme tell you ‘bout this girl I know
Breakin necks
Jaws drop when she walks through the door
Tryin’ tryin’ run up on her and holla
But she’s a real good girl
she – gets hit
Baby tell me what's on your mind
ww
lean
Gracie: Aww, you’re like a brother to me!
ok
thick
No! but best friends DO give mani pedis!
HOLD UP
Caught up in the friend
Caught up caught up in the friend zone
Gracie: I know it’s crazy! To think I’m in LOVE with your BEST FRIEND!
MattyB: Hold up!
