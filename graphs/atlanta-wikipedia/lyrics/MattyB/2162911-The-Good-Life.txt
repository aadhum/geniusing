It ain’t a party ‘till the honeys roll up
Cameras flashing,
the fashion
Juice on ice
Me and the fellas toast to the good life (that’s right)
You can’t underestimate the kid
Look homie, this is how I live
From LA,
I’m throwing block parties bigger than Puff Daddy
From song demos to stretch limos
I keep it 100 on these 1’s and 2’s
That’s why all these beautiful girlies around me
Wanna bust a move
I can’t help myself
They’re hands up in the air
And if I flex they say “That’s unfair!”
Young homie’s home
Get out my chair
Quit wasting my time
I’m taking what’s mine
I’m taking my time
Fresh to death if I step on the scene
I’m blowing UP from this teenage dream
Wild and crazy, young and free
These are a few of my favorite things
This is life homie, C’est la vie
Let’s make a toast to the good times
Here’s to the party of the year (chyeah)
Here’s for living never living in fear
And keeping it real
Here’s for blood's sweat, effort and tears
The sky’s the limit and the vision is clear
To stay on top of the world year after year
Thanks to everybody watching, all of my piers
And finally, here’s to making it here. Cheers!
