I don’t need any guarantees
Or them to tell me who I’m s’posed to be
Dreaming in the sky
Every day and every night
Tell the doubters goodbye
You’ve gotta live your own life
So many people wanna tell me no
But I’m courageous even on my own
I’m going hard - I’m not going home
I feel like David with the rolling stone
The quicker they rise
The quicker they fall
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
No goliath too big
No stone too small
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh no
Goliath oh
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh no
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Hook
The quicker they rise
The quicker they fall
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
No goliath too big
No stone too small
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh no
Goliath oh
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
Goliath oh no
Goliath oh no
Feels like I could slay giants high as 10 feet tall
