Yo, How could I ever regret
The moment when we first met
Something I could never forget
I met a crazy beautiful girl right?
Who was just my type
So I tried to play the part
Tried to play to start
Hit it off on the first date
Though I admit I was nervous
To meet somebody that made me feel that way
Wanted to keep it cool
But coming off like a fool
And pinching myself for all of the things I’d say
I saw it coming from a mile away
I couldn’t stop it, It was just too late
Cause when you love somebody
Sometimes you’ve gotta be willing to let them go
Or at least sit back and wait
I really hope that we can be friends
But I don’t wanna live in the pretend
She started crying trying to defend
What can I say
She was my first love
And I imagined we would be together forever
But now I’m the source of a heart break
I can’t eat
Cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you
Right now i’m missing you
[MattyB]
All alone sitting up in my room
Holding my phone, just thinking bout you
And I wonder if your out there thinking bout me
It’s been a week since you went away
Told me it’s over and you needed your space
I put my heart in your hands and you threw it away
But now I’m missing you
I can’t eat
Cause i only want you
I can’t sleep
I keep dreaming bout you
I can’t think
I’ll be thinking bout you, bout you
Right now i’m missing you
Look, I never knew the right words to say
Hat in my hand since you walked away
Trying to cope but can’t take the pain
Wishing I could hear you say my name
Wishing I could take back it all
Is it too late for me to call
Cause I could have anything in this world I choose
But baby girl right now I’m missing you,

I keep dreaming bout you

Right now i’m missing you
