[Intro]
It's MattyB
Yeah, here we go!
Now you can find me in Atlanta with an A Cap turned back
Dancing in streets with a little Georgia Peach
She beggin’ me to stay home, you know that I wish I could
But my flight leaves at 11, I’m headed to Hollywood
Wave at the Carolinas, St. Louis is Swag
Make a stop down in Dallas and maybe check out the Mavs
If I’m hungry - it’s Chicago
I’m dancing all over the map
Turn up, turn up, turn up the track
I just wanna dance
Turn up
the
track
party
Let me see your hands
Tip toeing over Florida, Louisiana, to
Bama
Then hit the streets of Las Vegas to keep an eye on the parents
Shake it up in Seattle
weather's
kinda
gloomy
So I trip over Wyoming and get lost off in the boonies
Fly to Michigan, go fly fishing again
Shopping spree in Manhattan and now that my money’s spent
Take me back to the south, I’ll fall in love in these streets
This girl must be from Nashville cause she's a ten I see
Hook]
I’m dancing all over the map
Turn up, turn up, turn up the track
I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
We put our hands in the air so high
Wave 'em side to side
Cause we feel alive
And the music is pumpin'
Our heartbeats are bumpin'
We sing and we laugh
And we jump and we're jumpin' - hey!
'em side to side
Cause we feel alive
And the music is pumpin'
Our heartbeats are bumpin'
We sing and we laugh
And we turn up the track
I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
I just wanna dance
Turn up the track and party
Let me see your hands
Turn up the track, yeah
Turn up the track
I'm out!
