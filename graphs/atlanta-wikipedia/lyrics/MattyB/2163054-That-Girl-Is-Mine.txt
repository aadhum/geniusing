The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine
Now here's a story 'bout the way it went down
I was hearing
I saw this little cutie out the corner of my eye
Look at her go
Look at her proving that I can't take it
I just wanna dance with her
She knows she cold
Knows how to kill it on the dance floor
The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine
But I was cooler than a penguin in a bucket of ice
I said I like your moves, I think that you're fly
She said I really really really wanna zig-a-zig ahhh
She knows she cold
Knows how to kill it on the dance floor
The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine
She can talk the talk
But what I really dig's how she walks the walk
Hands in the air
The way she moves her feet
Tell the other fellas that this girl is mine
The way she groves to that beat
All the girls are jealous that this girl is mine
