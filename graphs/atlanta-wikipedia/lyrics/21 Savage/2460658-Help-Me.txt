Help me, can you help me?
I got fifty bags of gas, can you help me?
I just cooked another brick, can you help me?
Help me, can you help me?
I pulled up in a Fisker then I pulled off in a
Tesla
Thought this shit was sweet, I left his ass on a stretcher
I don't catch feelings, I'm too busy catching
Deltas
Pull up in the trenches, pull up in the trenches!
I said that shit on woe, dog
Me and Lotto in that fucking Fisker switching lanes
Pull up on a pussy nigga and fuck on his main
I just spent a fifty-thousand dollars on a chain
I just spent a twenty on a motherfucking ring
