He told me they touch down in a week or two, so be ready to move
A Week or two passed, He pulled up with bricks
I'm Looking like shit, I'm Finna be rich
I Took a brick, took a 9 out and turned it back into a brick
And it's still coming back, Nigga i got the cleanest dope in the six
If he pull up with a hunnit i might have to take his life
I just robbed a Migo for his bricks now im serving bricks
