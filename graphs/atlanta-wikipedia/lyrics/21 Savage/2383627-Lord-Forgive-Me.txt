A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop
High speed chasing, give a fuck bout the cops
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock
Niggas be rappin, I came up off rocks
I'm thuggin', Im thuggin', I feel like I'm Pac
They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
These bitches acting like pigeons
Gas stank propane
I heard ya got ya chain took and had to get another damn chain
21 nigga the gang, slaughter ya daughter the gang
Mac 90 got range
young savage got aim
I bought a new Rollie, its plain,
Moving like im John Gotti,
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case
riding with a desert eagle
Pull up on ya in a regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, i was living like a demon
Now i lay me down to sleep, i pray the lord, my soul to keep
If i should die before i wake, i pray the lord my soul to take
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face (Tayman)
