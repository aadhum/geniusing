Carbon 15 on em
AR 15 on em
Got that Glock with the beam on it
Every nigga on my team want it
Oh, you a gangsta? You a savage now?
You ain't never sprayed a hundred rounds
Last nigga tried to gun me down
Left his body in the lost and found
Zone 6 shit bitch
Nigga barking up the wrong tree
You got one more strike fuckboy and I'ma whack you
But a nigga watch blinging, take it
But a nigga chain blinging, take it
Said he got a bankroll, take it
And yo' shooters ain't gon' do nothing
19 niggas tried to jump me in the club
I aired that motherfucker out
You ain't 'bout that shit that you rapping 'bout
Nigga tell the truth, what you capping 'bout?

I take pictures with my hand on my hip ass nigga
When it gets real I'ma gon' and dip ass nigga

21 Gang and we don't throw no white flags nigga
A lotta um fake you know what I'm saying beef
