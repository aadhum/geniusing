I feel like Tony, I'm a bad guy
Skinny clippers
You play with the shit you get whacked
I pull up and shoot at your neck
All I wanna do is hit licks
Fuck a trapper, I take shit
I'm tryna go me buy a Wraith and shit
No Miami, I got heat
My coupe got no ceiling
I'm not with the talkin'
Young Savage a villain
I feel like Tony, I'm a bad guy
Skinny clippers,
