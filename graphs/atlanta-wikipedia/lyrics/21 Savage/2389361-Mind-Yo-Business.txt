Pull up on your block, white chalk
Tony Hawk
shout
Pop a perc, hit the cup, nigga pause
Hundred round drum, round of applause
Bitches know I got that bag, Santa Claus
I drink lean and I pop Xans
San-Tan
Benz
We ain't with that friendly shit
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
Five shooters in the back of the Uber nigga and they ready to shoot
I tie my laces, I dip in that bag nigga and I take me a boof
I'm the Slaughter King nigga, I don't give a fuck about you
You get you some money, you get you some fame, these bitches gon' come out the blue
Bullet holes in my body, paranoid I'ma pop it
If you snitchin' I'ma pop it, wrong move, I'ma drop it
.15 in my sock, trappin' at the bus stop
nickel rock
We ain't with that friendly shit
Catch 'em out back, roll the window down and smash
