She gon' ride it like a motorcycle
throw it back baby recycle
Bitch I'm bleeding like I'm on a cycle
I be leaning baby no NyQuil
And I can't stop it
All my garments come from France
money piling up like ants
I can't stop it, hundred thousand stuffed in my pocket
Pull up on a nigga with a rocket
if I pull it out then imma pop it
I call her bike life cuz she riding, non-stop it
VVS diamonds got my watch playing hockey
21 savage I get money like a Jew,
hundreds on me blue, hundreds on me blue
You know I'm a slut, I'll fuck your crew
Pull up on your block with the chop cocked back
Pew pew pew, make a nigga walk back
1017 they need to bring the wop back
She gon' hold my dope when I'm in need, she gon' bail me out when I'm in need
Get up in the jam you know who to call to bail out
I'm knowing your bitch ain't had shit
