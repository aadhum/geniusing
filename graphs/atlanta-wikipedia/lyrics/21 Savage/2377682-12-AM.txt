Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark
Skrrt skrrt, scrape the sides, skrrt skrrt, scrape the bowl
Young savage, bitch, and I ain't never chasing no hoe
All I wanna do is count a big ol' bank roll
Young savage, bitch I walk around with a .40
Shout out to Trap-A-Holics, cause I'm a trapaholic
I ran off with your work and you ain't do nothing about it
You should have shot your jeweler cause your stones is really cloudy
All these rap niggas rapping like they really 'bout it
Catch your ass in traffic, snatch your bitch ass out that Audi
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark
I've been trapping since I can remember
I make the dope snow like it's December
My ice colder than the fucking winter
Police ass nigga,
you will get a nigga locked up
Stay down in the trap and ran my motherfucking guap up
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Flipping, selling hard; flipping, selling hard
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Trapping after dark, trapping after dark
Gotta have heart, gotta have heart
Gotta have heart when you're trapping after dark
