21 (x2)
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
I really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm bout
Really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm bout
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
Catch me at the studio or at the trap house
Pull up right now I'll serve you right now
Pull up in a rari
Pull up on a Harley
Hanging out the window
Two-Two-Three it hit like
Pew Pew, Pew, Pew
Bitch I'm posted in the VIP
With the drank sipping sip
Nigga know that when I pull up they gone dip (they gone dip)
When I pull it off the hip imma hit (imma hit)
All my Billy Bros pulling up and hopping out with sticks
got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
I really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm bout
Really wanna rap but this trapping what I'm bout
I got one foot in, one foot out
One foot in, one foot out
Catch me at the studio or at the trap house
Pull up right now I'll serve you right now
Nigga bang, bang
Got a stain, stain
Hit em with that two-two-three, now that shit stain stain
You know I sell cocaine
And then I pulled up in that rari, then I left in that M6
