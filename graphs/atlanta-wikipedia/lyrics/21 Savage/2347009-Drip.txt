21 Savage!
Metro Boomin
Savage Boomin, Or Metro Savage
Whatever you wanna call it, Or ball it
I got the same kinda guns like tip
VVS dripping these ain't crystals, Your jeweler disappoint he selling crystals
I hear your baby daddy work at Krystal's, I hope
You brush your teeth before you kiss him
I'm Whipping work, I done spilled baking soda on my shirt
I'm in the kitchen cooking crack like its bacon
(808 Mafia)
Thought he had a brick (Metro) But i sold him Flour
