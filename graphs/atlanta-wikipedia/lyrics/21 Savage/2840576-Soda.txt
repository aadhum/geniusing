Wash away the pain with the soda
Wash away the pain with the soda
Wash away the pain with the soda
Wash away the pain with the soda
Wash away the pain with the soda
Tryna make the work double up, I beat the bowl up
.40 on my hip, you know that chopper on my shoulder
I remember fast money and them slow bucks
Remember when I hit that nigga with the K
Niggas ain't loyal, nigga they'll betray you
Shoot 'em in the temple, give that nigga a fade
My dog got life and shit ain't been the same
Go hard in the booth and buy another chain
I do it for the money nigga, not the fame
