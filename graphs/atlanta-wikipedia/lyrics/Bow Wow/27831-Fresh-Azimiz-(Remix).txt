Ye ain't ridin (ye ain't ridin)
Ye ain't bumpin like I'm bumpin
Ye ain't sayin nuthin homie
When I was 8 I was rhymin not back yard game playin
Watchin Snoop anxiously and waitin for my chance man
Hot and cocky wit it cause I kno that I am man
I'm goin down in history like American Band stand
I stay fresh to def like the neighborhood dope man
Ice Age in the buildin'
Mike Jones! Who? Mike Jones (Mike Jones)
A lot of people said I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that
So I came back with a platinum plat, now Ice Age is on the map
I stay flossin' that candy paint
stay sippin' that purple drank
Stay grippin' that woodgrain
can't help it, it's a Texas thing
Johnny
like Bun B, I gotta keep it trill
Ghea, before I go, I gotta say one thing
April 18th, "The American Dream," (Mike Jones, Mike Jones)
Before I go, I gotta say one thing
April 18th, "The American Dream" (holla at me)
I got a spot in MIA to get away from the cold weather
Bow fall off nigga that'll be never
