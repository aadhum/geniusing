Hey where you started, nigga? Came in the game at the age of 6
I was a young'n, y'all new rappers ain't doin' shit
Everything I did, I been did it, once more
Blogs talkin' that broke shit, make 20 million off them Scream Tours
Lot of niggas still cuffin' hoes that I've been fucked, stalkin' their Instagram, lovin' these bitches
Can't even go out in public and chill with my daughter without the paps takin' their pictures
Who actually crip walkin' and rockin' braids (me!), this rap shit is all in my DNA
Founded by Snoop Dogg and Dr. Dre, don't give a fuck what you got to say
BET money too good, contract lookin' like Kobe (I'm ballin')
Me and JD still good (my nigga), forever y'all be my homie
Chris keep your head up and when you get out of rehab we gon' hit the road and get our bread up
Shit, I was talkin' to Hov, nigga
I'm 10 million sold, nigga
from movies to TV,
