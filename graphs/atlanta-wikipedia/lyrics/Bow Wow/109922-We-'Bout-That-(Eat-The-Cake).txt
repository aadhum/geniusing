[Intro - DJ Khaled]
YMCMB, Cash Money Billionaires
More cake, more money, more hustle
Bitch I'm ballin' hard, you ain't know?
At K.O.D. throwin' ones in strippers faces
Yeah that Ciroc just got me feeling good
I got retarded paper, I'm talkin' dumb money
it's an Ohio thing
I ain't Tity Boi, but I'm rockin' two chains
My lil' brother Marley G be on that drink heavy
I drive a fast car, that bitch go pumeee
Pussy, money, weed
I ball out like the ninth inning
World Series
In the name of the Father, Son, Holy Spirit
What my pockets on? Nutty Professor
Thick red bone looking like Beyonce
O
Don't know how to Dougie, but all the bitches love me
