And now that boy got chips, like Ruffles, Lays
And you can say I’m short, but you can’t say I ain’t paid
Helicopter pad for when I make them private escapes
I’m still the prince of the O-town
Make them hoes go down
Since I turned 21
I don’t know how to act
And smashing like err chick
Sittin' in a vet (Vet)
Gucci bandanna (dana)
Yellow diamonds same color as a taxi
I leaked every song and I still went platinum
I call that shit the Green Mile
