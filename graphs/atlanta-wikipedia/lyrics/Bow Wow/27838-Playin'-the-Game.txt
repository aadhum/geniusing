I'm at the mall on Saturday
I ain't got no cap on my salary
So you know, I'm tearin' it up
I mean there's so many girls here
Every time I look, I see them lookin' back at me and they sayin' 'What up?'
I'm too young to wife her, and so you know my game bumpin'
Like 'Baby, let's talk, let's hang; do somethin'!'
'What about them digits can I get that?'
She write 'em down, I give a pound and say 'Ma, holla back!'
Next door's just more of the same activity
I'm up in Tiffany's, talking to this girl named Britney
She trynna roll wit' me, she trynna shop wit' me
She trynna do whatever it takes to get wit' me
Like I'm easy
How you gon' act like my name ain't Bow Weezy?
And I ain't got breezys'
Comin' by the dozen, that's why the phone buzzin'
I'm sorry, but I ain't lookin' for no long time lovin', girl
