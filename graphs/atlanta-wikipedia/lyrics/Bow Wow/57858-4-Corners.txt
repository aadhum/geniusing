Question; What y'all know about swangers on slab
30's on a Hummer with the butterfly doors
Lucky Charm teeth, lack on them D's
Chevy sitting high, iced out everythang
Stacks on deck, no bank
I come from where a Chevy with a trunk full of bump is all that's wanted
And the year don't matter long as you throw some, throw some Ds on it
house on ten acres
Unh, now what y'all know about the country boys
Coming down with candy toys, playing hard talking noise
I'm the biggest balla in Houston homie, not Yao Ming
And I be sipping drank that's purple like a Teletubby
So when it comes to the women dog, I can tell they love me
They put they panties in a envelope an mail 'em to me
Now how's that for some fanmail
But me an Bow got a question, know the answer, raise your hand, yea
They call me Fisher Price cause all I do is play nice
My charger look like a muscle lifting a ton
If you picking on me, yea you picked the right one
No homo, Young Louisiana
Hit you wit the .357 like MC Hammer
And money talks, so that's my grammar
If you ain't about money, you can step like a gamma
And OG kush I what you smell here
They say I'm at the top, but I'm almost there
And when I get, I will sit, don't worry I brought a chair
