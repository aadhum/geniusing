And I ain't no magician but let me Copperfield
Baby my love is real tell me where you want it at
And she know my game sharper than a pack of thumbtacks
Baby let me tell you where you can put your clothes at
Shhh break it down
I don't want nobody else to hear the sounds
This love is a private affair
Interrupt the flow
No they better not dare
Um please don't interrupt us
Neighbours complaining saying we causin' a raucous
To show you just what kind of mood im in
I put that Your Body's Calling R.Kelly CD in
Yeah so tonight is goin down right
Have you running to yo friends tellin dem what Bow like
Talkin to them like that nigga put it down right
Had me pent up I swear to god girl I came twice
Im glad I got you yeah you little light of mine
I goin to thinkin about u when im out in town
Tell dem other dudes like new edition they can cool it now
And u know my love is unconditional
And for these hoes on the road girl I'll never diss you
