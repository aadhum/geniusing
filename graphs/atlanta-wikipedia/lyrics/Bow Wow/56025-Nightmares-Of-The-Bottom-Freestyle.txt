Smoke a lot of weed because I have little patience
My girl still trippin', shit what girl don't bitch?
Turn the volume up on the T.V so I don't hear shit
Wizzle keep it playa', ballin' like a Laker
They say the game is rough, well I'm gone' give that bitch a shape-up
Ohio is the state, Columbus is the city
I know yo' ass is real, but how much you pay for them titties
Cash Money Gang, you know what I'm reppin'
My homie doin' 9, he just got caught up with a weapon
My lil' girl gettin' bigger, she crawlin' trynna talk
If ya' album don't sell, Bow what yo gone' do ?
Probably keep makin' 8 mill a movie, i'll be cool
Cause' I ain't trippin' bout' these critics
Or these non-believers
Turnin' 25 soon, that's five years from thirty
I'm feelin' forty now, I lived my life too early
I'm in my own world, playin' by my own rules
I keep my eyes open, cause' niggas can be boney
Damn I love my women, redbone, white or dark
I been up strategizing on ways to get paid
