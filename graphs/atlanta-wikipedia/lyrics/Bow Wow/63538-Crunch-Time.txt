I do better when it's crunch time
I'm the motherfucken illest, when you see me salute me
And when it do my shit gonna be the only thing to cop
This ain't no Jag, it's an Aston Martin
Ya'll motherfuckers don't get me started
I came from the bottom, now I'm at the top
It's so hot, from way up here
I'm getting bored with this rap shit, it's gotten to easy
And these niggas do their thang but they ain't like Bow-weezy
Keep a Bow white bitch, yep I'm talking Sandra Bullock
And I'm all over the radio, I'm topping every chart
Now I'm begging women just to leave up out my tour bus
