I'm talkin bout pullin up in them big cars on them 22's
Naw forget that, I'm talkin 'bout Charlie Woodson's man
It's a wrap for ya'll when I turn eighteen man
Haha, listen to the hook
When I turn eighteen
I need a girlfriend older than me
I pull up and stop, let my system knock
I'm a be leanin and dippin, sittin on inches ridin
switch cars
Just call me Cassius Clay, baby cause I'm the greatest
