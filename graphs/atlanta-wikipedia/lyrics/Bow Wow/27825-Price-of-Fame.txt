Fifth album (fifth album), am still fresh (still fresh)
New money (new money), big cheques (big cheques)
I'm the Prince of the Hip Hop Game (that's right)
All you other lil' niggas stay in your lane
I see y'all doin your thang, but y'all ain't this man
Took me 13 years to get like this man
Been through a lot of bullshit in the past year
Relationships, couple rumors, you know how it is
I'm runnin over niggas like Jerome Bettis
And If I ain't the best, then what am I
