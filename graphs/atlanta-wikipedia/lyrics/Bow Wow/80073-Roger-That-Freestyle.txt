I talkin' fan caps
This is Cash Money baby, LB Dub baby
And I might just buy a ball team like Jay-Z
I ain't throwing up the diamond, and I don't rep the rock
I see you fucking with these bro colds
Its about to get ugly, Sam Cassel off in this ho
Its the B to the O Dub, you don't like me then so what
