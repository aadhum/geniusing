Mustard on the beat ho
If it ain't Rosé then we send that shit back
Roll it up, we smoke back to back
Hermès belt cost $650
If your girl look then your girl leave with me
P-I-M-P
and you just a hand cuffer
Ferrari, drop top
I keep 7 grams in a blunt
Keep another shorty on the side just in case she front
Get behind that ass quarterback snap
White tees, Levi's and a snap back
Niggas hatin' in the club, better stop that
Young Money Cash Money nigga we the shit
Hey you know it's a hit as long as Mustard's on the beat
You a lame, you a lame, ain't nobody fucking with you, you a lame
You a lame, you a lame, ain't nobody fucking with you, you a lame
