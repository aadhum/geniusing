I keep some linen that's clean, 50 thou in my jeans
Keep about ten pretty bitches on my team
I smoke I don't drink lean
And my niggas in here
Cash Money Young Money yeah this is our year
Eatin rappers for dinner, pass the knife and fork
Got 'em nervous like when that hurricane was bout to hit New York
It's a master at work, shit you niggas could learn
Alot of youngins in the game but they know who do it better
Diamonds shine bright like a Coogi sweater
Why you niggas lyin in your rhymes?
24 years old and I can fuckin retire
Muthafucka, it's the B. O
Represent the C. O
Mr. Big Dick, ask your girlfriend, she know
Damn this weed so strong, smokin outta this bong
Damn I'm so high, boy I forgot the words to this song
