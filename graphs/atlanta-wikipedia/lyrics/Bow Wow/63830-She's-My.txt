Lamborghini Moss
Real special occasion you know?
She a dime, she a problem
Bedroom time boy, I make her yell like the Khaled
Red American Express get what you want, got every bag
We don’t even feed in to that Bull like Jordan and Pippen, don’t be trippin
Late night she hit my Sidekick like "Bow come over"
Treat her like a fourth quarter
And put that D on her
She put up with all my bullshit and all of my drama and I know that she the one because I let her meet my mama
Give her cash to go to the mall-a
And when I lick that spot see she get real moist
Catered food on a jet
Me and her be taking trips
Passport full of stamps
Been to every continent
