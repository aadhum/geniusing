Want me to sell my soul
Just so I can go gold
Wantin' me to be Will Smith
But I gotta be Bow
Feel me, I'm
Hey man, I'm a big fan of that man
But I gotta create my own legacy
And all I need is drough
And NBA2K10
And my niggas, and I'm
That's all I need in this world to make me happy man
You can have the cars, clothes
The jewelleries, the houses and hoes
Homie I'm
If I gotta go through all that shit man
Ya'll can take it back
Your homie Bow,
people don't make full roll ups nigga
Nigga talk tough when they be on twitter
Then they see him out in person and they act like bitches
Boy am I on other shit
Damn man I'm bout to turn 23
Got me thinking bout kids and a wife and a life
I ain't stunting that nothing if it ain't benefitting me
In this game dog, ain't no loyalty
Cats do anything for a little bit of fame
And a little bit of change, niggas switch crews
That's hip hop dick ridin and you look lame
Perfect example New Jack City Part 2
My last album that was Sony's fault
Man the game has changed
106 ain't even the same
So hard for me to watch TV
Cats send me demos all the time
Then when they ask for some advice
I tell that young man stay in school
This rapping shit, think it over twice
Chew you up, then they spit you out
Here today, then you're gone tomorrow
I've seen rappers make millions off this shit
When the work stops then they end broke
