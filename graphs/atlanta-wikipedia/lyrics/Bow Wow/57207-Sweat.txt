Girl I wanna make you sweat
I’m riding in the ‘gatti with the windows full of steam
Boom let it out now
You're a freak baby, gon’ let it out now
Way you spread it out girlfirend I want you
Tell me when you’re coming baby, I’ma come too
You racking up them sky miles cause you stay fly
Sweating so hard you need three or four towels
Shawty wanna be my boo like showtime at the Apollo
Weezy F, the 'F' for follow, follow me straight to my condo
I’m from Hollygrove, I still hang with Elz
You bark up my tree, thats a dead dog
I like a shaved pussy, no razor bumps
when I step on stage, them hoes sweat like I’m Keith
Bursting outta them jeans
Cause you killin’ these other hoes
