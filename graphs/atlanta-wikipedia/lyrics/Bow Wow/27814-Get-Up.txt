Lil' shorty wanna rock the twists
Cornrows and rep like this, huh, I'm the blame
All they do is skip skip when the beat come on
Sing the words to every song
See they know what it is and who got style
Lil Bow Wow be the golden child
And I keep ya'll suckas shook up
Ya'll shoulda never let me and J.D. hook up
