Ace Hood!
What’s crackin’ nigga?
Getting it in, you niggas losing
We pop bottles, we really do this
Rims on the ride,
It’s YMCMB,
action
I-I-I put in work, watch me hustle
You niggas is nerds I'm talking Steve Urkel
Yeah my soldiers with me, like the Navy nigga
Yeah a white tee, and some Nikes
It's a hundred thousand resting on my white tee!
If you niggas looking for me I'm cool in the Phantom
White on white I named that bitch Hannah Montana
Strapped with that hammer, got bars like a slammer
You sleeping on me homie you'll die in pajamas
no coke in my veins
I'm way too fly; it's a bird it's a plane!
Ain't playing around with them lames
Quarter mil' I spunt on my chain
You rappers y'all are actors,
fuck once don't call her after
I'm back like chiropractors,
Underrated homie still I made two mil' or better...
traffic?
