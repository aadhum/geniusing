Elllllll-beeeeeee-duuuuub [LBW]

E.N.T
Girl fighting over me like Brooke Valentine
Got women over thirty-five screamin' my name
Flow so insane, e'rytime I drop
Makin hits after hits, no, I won't stop (naw)
Lil' kids to adults, homey, rappin' my songs
If you though J.D. wrote this, you wrong (It's me!)
If you ask me how I'm livin', I'll tell you, "I'm great"
Money stacks taller than the Empire State (Damn!)
Hottest thing since the L.L. and Kool Moe beef
Since thirteen, I been known for bumpin' out that steam
Ain't nuthin' changed homeboy, I'm still bringin' the heat
I ain't impressed by the stuff that y'all did
Stuff that y'all did, I'm way beyond it (uh-huh)
I had cake before, I got a lot more
Whole crowd ROAR, whole team SOAR
Spend a few G's, show her how a player ball (OWWWW!!)
Hit her later, show her how a player call
