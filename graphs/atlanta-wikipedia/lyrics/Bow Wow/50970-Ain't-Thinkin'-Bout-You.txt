and did somethin', real, you know
Somethin' for them, for the, ladies
You got the wrong one if you think I ain't goin' out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would think about
A Magic City stripper, huh, so this what this all about?
I'm in the club doin' my two step
But I ain't even knockin' your style
Ooh, see you on the blogs with your dude and all that
But little do you know, you makin' yourself look whack
If dude got a problem, better tell him to fall back
I'm blowin' real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
See it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better get your girl 'cause your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo, Bow!
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
We done been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
My BlackBerry's filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
It used to be you that I like
But I'ma do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one
And watch the ladies jump on me
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
I'm bein' honest, listen shawty, I don't want you no more
So leave the keys to the Benz 'fore you hit the front door
'Cause you losin' and she choosin'
like Chris said I'm chuckin' up the deuces
On to the next one,
I'm poppin' bottles all night
that black card
I'm not looking for love 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
