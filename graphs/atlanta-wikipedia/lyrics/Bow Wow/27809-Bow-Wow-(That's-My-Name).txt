My name is
Hair nappy but I'm happy pocket full of dough
From the C-O representin' So So
The girls recognize and these niggas do too
I'm the flyest thing walkin' through junior high school
So make room next to your little, Backstreet poster
I've been seen with the baddest, heard with the best
And I got it locked down from the East to the West
Look at my eyes, ya know; I ain't playin'
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Little with the ill crossover like Iverson
two-kay
ice in the bezel of a G-Shock
Like B.I.G. and Pac, I'm hard to forget
What makes it even worse, I'm just getting started
Thirteen, game locked, don't trip
All that and a bag of chips
"Hi! My Name Is.."
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Woof motherfucker the Dogg came to play
I'm in the dirty dirty with my nephew J
Dizzy
With Lil' Bow Wizzy, this shit is off the heezy
I threw him like a Frisbee
And, "Yeah, he came back."
boomerang
Dogg Pound gang
money ain't a thang
Buck one, buck two, buck three, buck fo'
bag it up
Doggystyle
Big Bow Wow
