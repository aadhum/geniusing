When I step to the plate the outfield gets back (back)
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammy Sosa
Bubble gum cards and all the posters
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat
Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire
That other kid was just a Mark, so I made him retire
They call me young Wheezy Rodriguez
You know I'm gettin it hot as the bullet that (killed) Kennedy,
Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan
The Little Rascals
