I show her how a real kid rocks
Me and Kelis on the beach having fun
Her cell rung 9-1-1, it's
God's son
He couldn't understand so I had to explain
I said look our size is the same
But I'm way cuter it was easier to scoop her
Chante moore's on the phone
Now Kenny Lattimore cries all alone
Brad Pitt started a fight club again
Cause me and Jennifer Aniston real close friends
J.lo I don't know
I don't wanna go where everybody been
Affleck who's next
Forget your chain I snatch your chick from your neck
Eric Benet, Banet be not
You the x-man I'm all that Halle's got
I wanna go one on one with Kyla Pratt
Nivea cleaning my throwbacks in laundrymats
Jennifer Freeman got kicked from the crib
She was talking 'bout some wife and
Kids
Meagan Good if I could then I would
You say I won't but I really think I
Should
Cause I'm a pimp
