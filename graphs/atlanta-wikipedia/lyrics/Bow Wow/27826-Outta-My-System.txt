I'm sittin lookin out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
Me all on ya mind, I'm knowin that it couldn't be
I been runnin 'round with other chicks - I'm single and they lovin it
I'm likin it, but I just want the one that I was in love with
You gotta hold of some kinda control on me
I don't know what it is - but I gotta get you gone from me
Instead of starrin out this glass - lookin at this bad weather
Damn I gotta pull myself together, cause...
I miss the smiley faces in my sidekick,
It's too major, don't see you in my pager
Know what you doin?, where you at?, or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin'me just let her go Bow
Believe me I'm tryin man I just don't know how
I be in all the hot spots - leavin with the hot shots
Knowin they just want me cause I'm the top spot
- can you feel me
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time - that's what kills me
Hook: Bow Wow
I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did
