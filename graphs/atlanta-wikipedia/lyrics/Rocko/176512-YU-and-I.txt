[Hook: Justine Suissa]
You and I
Truth and lies
I've been fooling myself too long
You and I
Breaking ties
How could we be so right and so wrong
She wanna tie the knot
Maybe I was wrong, she deserved 50-50
I'm at the 40-40,
hindsight 20-20
Saying 1, 2, J1 was the DJ
She flirt with me, I throw it right back at her, boomerang
Normally be in and out but somehow I just let her cool it
Damn babe, why the fuck you had to ruin it
