Wake up bright and early, put on my pants and grab my rocket
This shit cocked and loaded then I put it in my pocket
Yeah, my pockets look like books, Yale was my college
Like a quarterback I pass, pockets look like that pad
Dizzy Bentley, rose, we don't drive no Maseratti
Brought your broad off in my party, got my rod off in her body
She said my nigga said he'll kill me if I fuck you
So I guess I have to hop off your truck you use to get laid
You can close your mouth and let it free
