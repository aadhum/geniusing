You got people that surround you
They gone try they best to down you
Keep them squares up out your circle
I'm a loner, Dottie, I'm a rebel, it's whatever
Right now I'm in Belize
It's midnight in Georgia, where I'm at its noon
I'm a barb wire tie, gotta stay sharp
Cross my heart, Cross by my heart
Spit chrome heart; Help me spot the fakes
Wolves in sheep clothing, I loath them
Donnie Brasco, Benedict Arnold
Shall not be harmed by any weapon formed
Sometimes you gotta cut off your finger
To save your hand
You don’t understand what that means
That’s that gangrene
