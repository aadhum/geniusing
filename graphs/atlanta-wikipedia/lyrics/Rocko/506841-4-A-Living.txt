I dream about it, woke up, did it
Everywhere I go they love me, they say I'm cool as shit
Fly as a jet but down to earth, I just be coolin' it
Humble individual, raised up with principles
Kick it with the interests, I put up all the principles
Threw away the rear-view, got to move forward
I took a chance to get it, I gambled, I chased a dream
I still can't believe it, this shit wasn't guaranteed
Fuck no, I ain't no pessimist, I'm an optimist
Shit a risky business
Overgrind
I can't sleep, I got insomnia
they want the formula
Five eight, charismatic, very athletic
Never did a push up boy, but good genetics
Runnin' laps around these suckers, gotta get your cardio
Poker face, I'm all-in, gotta have heart, you know?
Triathlon nigga, swim, riding bikes, or run
Some might do very well...but I'm the Don
