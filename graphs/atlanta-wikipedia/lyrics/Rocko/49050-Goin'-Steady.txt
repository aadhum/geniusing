Aye, my name is Rocko, and I'm a addict
I'm addicted to money, I love fast cars
I love jewelry, I love pussy, but I don't love these women
We ain't goin' steady,
we just be fuckin' 'round
Yeah the sex great but damn babe we fuckin' 'round
Girl you got me hot, poppin' up at my spot
You out yo got damn mind, what the fuck is you thinkin' 'bout?
You've been misinformed, sorry if you read me wrong
But if you are lookin' for a dude, girl I ain't yo guy
We just be coolin' it, we ain't goin' steady
Just hit my phone when you wanna play, girl you know I'm ready
We just be fuckin' 'round, girl you know better
You ain't my main squeeze, it ain't like we go together
You just my lil' buddy, we ain't goin' steady
Girl we just be fuckin', we ain't goin' steady
You just my fun girl, and me and you know better
We just be kickin' it, it ain't like we go together
Aye, she textin' me like crazy, sendin' me them smiley faces
