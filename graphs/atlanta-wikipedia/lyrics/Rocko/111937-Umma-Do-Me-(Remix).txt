Thesee niggas talking cane, but they pockets clean
We spendin money getting money nuttin in between
Chasin a hundred mil ain't gon let nuttin intervene
Respect da hustle bustas gon do dat by any mean
Ay dis I really mean put dis on anything
Dey say I start a lot of shit I say I finish things
Jus like sum dental cream I go in niggas mouth
And like da limousine I stretch a nigga out
Smoke a pound every week like I don't need lungs
So many rooms dat it looks like a high school
