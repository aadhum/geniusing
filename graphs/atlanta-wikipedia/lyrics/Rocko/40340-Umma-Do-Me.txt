I'ma do me! I'mma do me! I'mma do me!
You just do you - I'mma do me! I'mma do me! I'mma do me!
I wear Bally
I dropped six hunnid points on these Guccis
You really like her, you might wife her
I don't like her, so I one-night her
Wanna see how it's done? Watch me do me!
You need a key for yours? Me, my whip auto-start
Man I talk to the car and the car talk back
Your money funny {*laughing*}
You like the fo' door (me) I just do two (okay)
If you ain't gettin money, nigga I'm nothin like you
I'm from the old school, you from the new school
The shoes match the hat, the hat match my bag
