Good, good, good, good
You that good, good
Good, good, good, good
Rocko fuck wit me
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good, good, good, good
That’s good news, I’m gettin' money
Keep good goods, come shop with me
Hustler, that’s automatic
Just a good guy, with some bad habits
Can't lie, we have a good time
We made a good movie, rated R
Good noise, that’s good music, no Kanye
[?]
Gimme gimme, good and plenty
OPP, good as any
She want a Superman, I hit her with that yule
Same thing so it's all good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good I think I love her
But all good pussy ain't good for you
And I can’t believe it’s not butter
But a blind man gave me advice:
Don't believe in love at first sight
I don't fuck, I make love
You can't be mad at passion
She swallows all of my battery acid
I'm smoking on that good
She got that good, good
And I'm a good fella
What more can you ask for?
Crazy bitches got the best pussy
That’s why I’m still fuckin' my ex pussy
I swear
It's so nice I had to say good twice
But all good things had to come to an end bitch
Good night
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good
Good Ice Cubes on me, yea, today gonna be a good day
(?)

Give her good wood, she gives a good juke
Young MVP, I can't pull her out
She a bad girl, she a good bitch
I mean a good girl, bad bitch
Same thing so it's all good
Good, good, good, good
She got that good
Good, good, good, good
Good, good, good, good
