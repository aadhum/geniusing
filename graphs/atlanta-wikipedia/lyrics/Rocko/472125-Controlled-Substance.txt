I can't escape it, it's everywhere I'm at
Even if I walked away, I'll be running back
Hit after hit, I gave away, I drop street albums
I can't even call it mixtapes; too much substance
Shine harder than the biggest star in the sky
Yeah, the Big Dipper, baby
I'm a poet; specialize in poetry
My voice emotional, make 'em say yes; flowetry
I was just thinking how a young nigga can have such an old soul
Probably all that old gold
