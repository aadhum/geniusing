You at the lab, you at that yo'
Yo' car a vertible, it's a drop
Yo' shit didn't sell, that mean it flopped
You call them birds, we call them thangs
Million dollars, that's a M
We call em' feet, you call em 'rims
You whipped it up, you used that fork
You got that cash, you got that bag
We don't call them shoes, we call em' kicks
Call that choppa, we call that stick
You high off weed, that mean you zooted
I say i'm beating her, yeah i'm fucking
You on that jack, stay off that phone
He got jammed, then he got caught
Don't call it knife, we call em toys
If she bad she a quarter
Twenty dollars still a dub
Fuego, that mean you hot
You got it bad, bitch you in love
They say you pie, that mean you pussy
They call it stones, we call em' rocks
