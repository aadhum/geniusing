I've been drinking, I've been thinking
What my life would be without you
Come too far to turn back now
Think about all the things we've been though
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle
The C-E-O, the rapper,
Kick back, getting tatted up drinking
Louis XIII, throwing back shots, thinking
Veteran reporter
I never trusted the Department of Justice
Police corruption, drugs, what's the explanation
Nas a Afrocentric-Asian, roam this ghetto plantation
Under surveillance, gotta pay another bailiff
Gotta spray another Mac, ducking all these bullets hailing
It's not enough crackheads like it used to be
Unless you selling bricks, you ain't really seeing G's
Gotta bust a strip real quick, pills or lean
Get whatever from a pharmacy, it's either that or a robbery
Catching niggas shining, book his punk ass
Niggas got their video on the Star, they mixtape on the net
Let's hustle
Put some food on the table, everybody grab a plate
But didn't nobody cook, nobody brought to groceries
Took my homies to the water, taught 'em how to fish
Letter A, number one, first at everything
