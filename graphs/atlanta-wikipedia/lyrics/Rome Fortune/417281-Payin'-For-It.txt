All up on my dick, fall back,
you talking shit
But you just really wanna call back
we turnt up
The way you smile at me, it's been a while
I said
titties bumping, jumping all out your fucking blouse
Facade of a bad broad, I know it
As long as when the light's low, uh, you throw it
Got a name for your type, won't say it
Turntables between your thighs, I DJ it
I text when I'm bored
