Okay, I'm Biggie Biggie baby
Javelin javelin
Tell me where your aim is
I say she took another dip
Wiped it off her lip
It's four seasons
I bet she springing when I call
Use the summer just to ball
It's four seasons
You better rise before the fall
Cause it's a lot of winter months
It's four seasons
I bet she springing when I call
Use the summer just to ball
It's four seasons
You better rise before the fall
Cause it's a lot of winter months
It's four seasons x8
In my socks got some super rocks
