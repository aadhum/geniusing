Most bitches say classy
Those claims are fraud.u.lent
Dog im in my hey day
I can fuck all.of.them

But hear what i am saying
Don't cuff if ya insecure
No matter how bad she is
A nigga done slutted her
Before
My word
My fuckin word
My fuckin word

Head while im driving
Im swear im focused
Its good i swerved

Hit a speedbump
She starts gagging
I've got some nerve
Im not a nerd
I know the game
My flock. my herd
We ain't playing
We ain't playing i know
I been saying
I been here before

And bitches be callin me
But money be callin me
Who call im gone
Pick up
I gotta do the "baller" thing

I gotta do the "baller" thing
Never want a loss for me
A nigga out flossing
Are the targets often

I gotta do the "baller" thing

I gotta do the "baller" thing
Never want a loss for me
Most niggas say real
Too, those claims fraudulent
How the fuck should i feel
If i can't get lost of them

They got bricks
They got bodies
But they don't got shit

Just talk that's sloppy
And the kids go copy
Ain't that a bitch

I mean im looking
I swear im looking
And they say they cookin
My niggas in brooklyn
Ain't talkin just wolfing

Then when we see you pussy
Oh my god pussy
That is on camera
If you talk about doin work you better carry yo hammer
