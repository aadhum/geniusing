Hey
I just want to dance
So I don't have to think about
The things I think about
I just want romance
But if it doesn't come about we can dance it out
We do not have to get nasty (no)
We do not have to stay classy
My heart is broken, I don't want to fix it
This beat is perfect, do you want to French kiss
Our lives ain't perfect, do you want it different
Your car ain't running, I'mma start the engine
