Two-toned guts
Get the money, bro
Every dollar earned, there's another foe
Sixteen bars, 'bout a hundred shots
They ain't my problem, I'mma get the guap
I'mma get the guap
They ain't my problem, I'mma get the guap
I said, I said, I said, I said
Get some money, man
It ain't hard to do
The no emotion route
Take it farther, you
Got to get food upon your table, stallions and your stable
Niggas sitting on the couches able, but don't make the payroll
And these days are passing faster, so I need the check
If I can't get that shit myself, then I don't need the sex
That bitch was bad up in a honda, now she in a lex
Said she would never date a baller, but that was a flex
Get some money, man
What is wrong with you?
Talking 'bout THAT nigga
THAT is Rome, you fool
OK, stallions are now in my stable, hit that roll with bankrolls
They can speculate about my life, but it won't change my payroll
And the days are passing faster, so I grip my grip
Got a little chick who tryna trick, so you know I'mma get
Her mind
Nigga, she can keep the whip
Yep, her mind
We gon' make this money flip
I sit it down to say
Like every single day
That passes with no pay
Evaluate to work my lay
With the body made, the mythology
And her brain is never gray
A few chapters of this pimpology
Get the dough and graduate
And that's fine, that's my
Summer break you take in May
That passes every day
Fly there with no delay
So, Rome, what you say?
Yeah, do just what you say?
I said the bread is all that matters 'til they pull us down the lay
I said!
