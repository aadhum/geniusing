On rough terrain
I know what to gain
Know what to say
Know when to duck
Know when to bang
Kill the lights for a minute
And might I score before I finish
Predator on tenants
Hit the bed for the fun
Then the floor for the biness
I'm doin' it baby
No jewelry, it's just me and a lady
No you'll see when they callin' me famous
Now old hoes cussing me out all in spanglish
I see everything I need
But how im gone get it
I might just take it
Make ya look like spending it
On better terrain
I'm Mediterrain
Nean
Yes a nigga's insane
But I love to climb
And I love to grind
And with that combine
That's ass is mine
Plus the way I fuck
And the way you suck
You can't decline
Lemme chill for a moment
Cause I know that you want me
But I need you to know this
This will never be recited
Just open up invite me
And we goneâ€¦ I said
We do nothing but talk
I just want to take it further
So this is the plan
Tonight we gone stop runnin' circles
