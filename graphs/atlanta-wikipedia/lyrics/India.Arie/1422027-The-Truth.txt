Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie
It's almost like I knew this man from another life
Like back then maybe I was his husband maybe he was my wife
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie (no)
Cause he is the truth, said he is so real
And I love the way that he makes me feel
And if I am a reflection of him then I must be fly Because his light it shines so bright I wouldn't lie
