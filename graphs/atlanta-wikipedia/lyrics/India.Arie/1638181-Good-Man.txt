I remember the first day
I met you
We were so young
You were a blessing
And there was no guessing
You were the one
Love is so crazy
We had a baby
And said our vows
That's when you told me
Should anything happen
I can hear you now
You told me
If the sun comes up
And I'm not home
Be strong
If I'm not beside you
Do your best to
Carry on
Tell the kids about me
When they're old enough to understand
Tell them that their daddy was
A good man
Two eyes
Looking
Up at me
Pointing to the picture like where is he
Mamma are you OK
