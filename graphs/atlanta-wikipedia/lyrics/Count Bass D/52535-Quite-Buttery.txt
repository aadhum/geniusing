It's been a long time
True indeed
Congratulations to the Count and the Countess on the new seed
It's a blessin'
Flow is a heel, the beat is a steel toe
Give 'em what they feel to put they hands up real slow
Knew he â€˜bout to blow ever since hearing Beno
Villain known to flip scripts like Tarantino
MCs need Aveeno
OK the fun's over
One time, while I give the track a once over..
Word, quite buttery
Number one answer, did I st-st-stutter G?
It's all ugly, they found a new discovery
Brand new spankin' way to G off lovely
Any thing we do, never on no sing song
Always from the heart no matter who got no bling on
DOOM keep it movin' back and forth like ping-pong
Go on, get your swig on
Before he bring the liquor out, just make sure the nigga gone
