Do you want my love?
So have you ever heard of a group called TLC?
With hits "Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg" and "Baby Baby Baby"
I was chillin with the Leaders of the New
Atlanta, Georgia
The two were close related in fact sister kidren
I had only seen TLC, on Video Vibrations
Left Eye is her name cause she played me (to the left)
But I was mesmerized with her sex appeal
Rumors ran free, that she loved Jodeci
But I get around like 2Pac and chain letters
Not even ?Meryl Stuben? could have been more friendly
Huh, T-Boz tried to talk me yo..
