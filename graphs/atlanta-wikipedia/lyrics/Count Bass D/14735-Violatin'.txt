You think you Guru cause your rep is growing bigger
But you can say I'm sort of the boss cause I'm a skinny black
Beat machine
Doctor Rhythm, giving quadruple bypasses
To my sampler in a 4/4 meter
And while you rhyming about your homes in the Hamptons
We down here, keeping it live like Peter Frampton
