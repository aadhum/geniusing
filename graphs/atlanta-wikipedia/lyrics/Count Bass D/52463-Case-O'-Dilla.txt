Posses no peer, fight fear with beer
In this life some niggas ain't gon' like you
Don't feed the mouth that bites you
Blunt with a swag weed when it's dro of Cigarillo
Even though they stay yo, Wajeed in the D
Conversatin', conversin', what I'm sayin'
Is conversation is my occupation I'm employee of the month
But with not notified, enjoy my food fried
Enjoy my hair fried, some say that's a slave mentality, I'm like, word?
