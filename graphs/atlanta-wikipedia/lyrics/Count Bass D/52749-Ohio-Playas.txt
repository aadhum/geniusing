Yeah, This is a Ohio Playas, collaboration
Please don't invite me to the booth my nigga Tigger
I ain't Jigga, just a poor black nigga
Dribble with my right hand, never with my left
I never play Basketball
I only tap out the beats
When J. Rawls don't
I'm automatic like the Sandbox, or The Pointer Sisters
Or maybe even Prince for instance
50 feet is all I need for me to breathe
Hey fellas gather round, lemme tell ya bout this beat
That's blowin' my mind
