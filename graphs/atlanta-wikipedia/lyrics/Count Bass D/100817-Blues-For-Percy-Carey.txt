And let 'em cough up blood like phlegm, it's grim [Hook]
Peace to my synonyms, saying you never heard of him
Jack be Janet, preferably Jenny
from the beginning
Three loves, three hearts, let's smoke together and wine all night
Rhyme not fight, love him not Dwight
Catch up, retouch the "S" curl hair
Conk and Jerry, hot comb and rollers
Diaper bag, do rag, car seats and strollers
