My name is Count Bass-D on the rhymes
Dope -- period
My name is Count Bass-D on the Rhodes, on the bass
On the drums, on the 808, and all that
Lisa, Angela, Pamela, Renee
Are some of the girls that LL knows from around the way
I know some hoes, that will always give up the play
But I don't want that, so I should go where LL stay, huh
I'm a meal, not a snack
Lick my colon
