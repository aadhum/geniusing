The days are getting stranger as I'm meeting face-to-face with
People who have millions of dollars up in the bank
We talk about my music and we talk about my image
And I still don't really know what to say
I got these people in my ear telling me how I should sound
They disrespect my DNA, it feels fake
Too much truth for the club, too real for the youth group
Three album contract, I'm about to be two down
So, unh, It's still crowns over crossbones
