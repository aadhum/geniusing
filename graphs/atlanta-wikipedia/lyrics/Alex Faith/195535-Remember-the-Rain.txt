Awake from a scream, I wonder what that sound is
Ten minutes later bloody water on the ground mixed
Rest in peace send my baby boy where them clouds is
Where the king with the crown is
Me and your momma loved you and we never even met
Best and worst day of my life, I won't forget
The day I held my son and the day my son died
Tears filling mine as I'm looking in his eyes I
I don't deserve this, Lord what are you doing? Then I heard him say.. (I took the pain for you)
Is this punishment for things I been pursuing? Then I heard him say.. (I took the pain for you)
I know that I failed you 1000 times. Then I heard him say.. (I took the pain for you)
I've amassed a lot of sin but he died for mine. So I heard him say.. (I took the pain for you)
Everyone's saying to trust you but I don't want to
