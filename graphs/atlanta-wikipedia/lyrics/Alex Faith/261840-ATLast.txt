Gang sign holding up
Gas prices going up
Can't wait until the day to get wasted because he's old enough
Turned 21, in the bathroom throwing up
But this is not a new thing
He's kind of well acquainted but
Running on a wheel is the future he never watching
When he get a little change
Just burning holes all in his pocket
noose
Crown of thorns on his head
Ain't no fire in His eyes
And to make sure that He's dead I see Him bleeding from His side
I told them "Hang Him on that tree!"
I told them "Put Him on display!"
Touched the coal to my lip and sent me on a mission
We call ourselves kings
I love my city
I love my people
And I know they got a problem with sitting under that steeple
Broadcasted on the airways
We're claiming fallacies
That if we get to where they at
That means we have it all
