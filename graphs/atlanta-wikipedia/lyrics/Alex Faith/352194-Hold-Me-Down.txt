I don't know why we gotta act like this right now
Cause I'm out the driveway, I'm down the road
And I'm switching lanes just to show you how
And then I take it back but I crossed the line
Fighting like this I'mma loose my mind
Push it to the limit almost every time
Whenever someone ask I just say, "we fine"
It's our business we dealing with it
Getting to the point were we can't fix it
Getting to the point were we bout to split up
Don't know who to call don't know who hit up
I ain't standing here trying to save my face
Down on my knees now I'm praying for grace
Eyes red and my hands raised
What I gotta do to get us out this place
Got my bags packed at it at the door
Told her, "Baby I can't take it anymore
