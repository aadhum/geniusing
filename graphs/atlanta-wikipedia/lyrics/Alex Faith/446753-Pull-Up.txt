Always on that Gold Rush
You know I’m a fiend right?
Destroy the youth but stack that paper guys
Huh, way to go
I can’t just do a song and fix it
Play that so-and-so
So I hit the brake, they do a double take
No earthquake, just aftershock
Spit these power lines, they shock
Every time I pull up, stop
Play that so-and-so
purp
You ain't tryna get lost in that county
No price tag on what we endorse
My old man got worked for it
They pierced Him in His side
Pop prednisones and antihistamine blockers
Play that so-and-so
