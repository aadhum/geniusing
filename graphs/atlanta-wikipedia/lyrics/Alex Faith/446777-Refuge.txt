As the paint drips candy and I swing around the corner
My whip clean as it can be
gold in my mouth
Grandmama even had ‘em how we do it in the South
Shorty pop it, drop it low show us what you working with
But I would kill my daughter if I ever seen her twerking it
This is what it really is I’ll tell you what it’s never not
The demons pitching on the curb
I call it the purge they call it the payment
I turned eighteen, I was happy to be alive
300 miles from the ocean
Six million kilowatts keep slot machines open
It’s LV, NV, Las Vegas in me
Far from Jurassic,
cars park in darkness
The man you see is the captain
The passenger seat’s a teen and she’s trafficked
