When I was a young boy, my daddy had a red Cadillac on Vogues
Sitting on those whitewalls on 'em, with the bass on swole
Get a little older and I got my own, sound in the back
Sunroof top; Cartier '93, I know bout that
This how it is in Riverdale
this how it is in Zone 3
May be in the gutter, but I'm looking at the stars
You can keep your two cents, I'm not worth you going broke
It's that real life that we living; sittin' top of them riches
Moscato we sippin', got them models in my linen
I said wake up, homie
We living life like a schizo cause we don't know what we doing
