Beat like this got a man feeling like I'm making classics
Wife of my own when I ride so you know I got a bad chick
We live as kings like that's so far from your average
I done found myself in the same position
Trying to pick a dame, but I can't playing games
Entertain different names, we exchanging digits
Lately I've been feeling weak, so weak
Probably cause I've been gone week to week
Where me and God don't ever barely speak, don't speak
Right now I feel like I'm in a hole and I'm trying to climb out
When I'm with the kings
That I have a place
