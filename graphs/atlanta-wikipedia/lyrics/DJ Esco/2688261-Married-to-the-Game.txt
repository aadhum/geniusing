More money, more problems
More guns, more violence
I beat a couple cases, I feel like John Gotti
Hop out a Benz baby, I feel like thug life
I feel like taking some drink right now and pouring it up with my niggas
We ain't never turned down, I'm a Big Dipper
Big tipper
Even the witness gon' send you the penitentiary
Lay on ya, spray on ya, hop in the Coupe
You didn't know about Molly world 'til I introduced you
Don't none of these niggas compare to me
Most of these niggas are fans of me
I really appreciate it
Majority of these bitches ain't loyal to y'all, done been ran through
I sit back and lay back and flip through the channels
I flip through the channels, I'm watching the streets and I know I ain't Desiigner
The deeper the ocean, the deeper the pain
Ain't gotta call out no names
They know I'm married to the game
