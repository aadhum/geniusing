Super mothafuckin' Future
DJ Escomoecity, the coolest DJ on the mothafuckin' planet
All these hoes bogus
They tryna tell me to turn down, I refuse to do it
They tryna tell me I'ma lose, I'm the undisputed
I just did a walkthrough and I bought a Cuban
Bunch of fake lawsuits, my attorney Jewish
I just bought a Benz with a walkthrough
And I had snatched two Presis
I'ma floss so you can see it, make your ass regret it
I'm 'bout to cause an explosion
I'm 'bout to flex on 'em soon as I see 'em
They better know that I'm chosen
You see my watch and my chain and rings
Everything frozen
You see my face on the magazine
I'm gettin' global exposure
I count it up like a money machine
Then I get ready to blow it
I know the streets like the back of my hand
Finessin' in violence
See where I'm from, you know what I been through?
It's very surprisin'
