Pop the cork on the champagne bottle, champagne bottle
Polo shorts above me knee feelin like Carlton
If you ain't about that life, lil nigga might as well don't start shit
I got this forty on my hip, nigga it ain't no secret (bowbowbow)
I'm in that deep freezer beating up that meat like Rocky (ay)
Pop the cork on the champagne bottle, champagne bottle
I'm too damn intoxicated, got too many pills in me
I'm too damn intoxicated, got too many pills in me
Pop the cork on the champagne bottle, champagne bottle
