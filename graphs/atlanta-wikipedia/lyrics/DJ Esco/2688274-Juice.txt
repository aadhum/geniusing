Oh that’s your girl? You know I hit her
Pity niggas, she through with them
Tryna fuck my baby mama, dog what’s up with you?
You gon’ make me get that heat, I’m pulling up on you

You can place an order, I’m guaranteed to take it
Times got harder, they thought we wouldn’t make it
Got to grind harder, I started going brazy
Took a couple Adderall for my concentration

Oh that’s your girl? You know I hit her

You gon’ make me get that heat, I’m pulling up on you
These diamonds on me clear, they looking like glass
I drank it out the seal then roll it out the bag
Come from out the field, we rolled up with the trash
They grind up on some mills, they treat you with some class
You hold ‘em back ‘til we made it out the trap
You better wear your gloves and hit ‘em with the mac
I walk inside the club, I got to have the strap
It’s personal, free ‘em now
Murder trials, OJ Simpson
White on white, OJ Simpson
Double murder, OJ Simpson
Tryna fuck my baby mama, dog what’s up with you?
You gon’ make me get that heat, I’m pulling up on you
