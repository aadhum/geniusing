Every weekend its a side show somewhere
Every club, every event
Somebody gonna start a side show
They gonna close the freeway down at the entrance
And start the sideshow on the freeway
It's stupid
I see you all in the videos, woah
Yeah, in my city I'm like 23, yeah
Or number 8 before the new steez, yeah
We playing hoes like Nintendo, woah
Young Veggies
Sick Wid It
Vallejo
You know I love a ratchet from Richmond
I'm a warrior, bitch we ball over Pistons
Draymond Green in my backwood
We don't fuck with no swishers
I wonder if she still gon be here if I get low
This music took me to some places that I wouldn't go
So I thank God, grind, and I get more
Damn, she ask me if I like pussy, I'm like man
You must not really know who I am
She told me she wanna young nigga with dough
Range Rove
