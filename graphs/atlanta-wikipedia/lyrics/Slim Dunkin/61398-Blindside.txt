Put that Glock down before I bring that ch-chopper around
Usual suspect, when the shell cases
First name basis with all the bail places
You know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming I can see him from my blindside
Clayton county, I think I'm Victor Hill
Yeah I got them dummies, but them bricks real
Just cause I got that chopper don't mean I can't fight
You know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming I can see him from my blindside
Reach, that's your first class ticket to the hospital
Brand new .45, choppas is your obstacle
Tom Cruise with the Tommy, Mission Impossible
Bitch I'm in the hood, these rap niggas never there
Mac catch em slipping shoot his ass in the computer chair
Dirt gang, bunch of wild niggas, love to buck
Keep the pump to blow your motherfuckin' stomach up
I ain't ever fuck with ya'll, we weren't never partners
You ain't ever pull no tool, never bought no chopper
All the actin front these gangstas, need a fucking Oscar
Nigga try to rob me, he gon' Meet the Fockers
Leave you in Jurassic Park, nothin' but your fossils
You know I got that iron tight
Pussy nigga coming I can see him from my blindside
