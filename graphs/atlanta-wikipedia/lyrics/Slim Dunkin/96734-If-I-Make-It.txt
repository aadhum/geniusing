Granny said I'll make it to Heaven
I hope I Ain't Spoil it (3x)
Granny said I'll make it to Heaven
I hope I Ain't Spoil it (3x)
Granny Said I'll make it to Heaven I hope I ain't spoil it
Alot of shit changed since she died on the toilet
Raised me right
From time to time I made the wrong choices
Fuck your honor only God Can Judge me
My past is all I keep dreaming about
Did the same crimes as niggas that will never get out
If I make it to Heaven I hope I make it to heaven
All the dirt I did it probably be a blessing [4x]
I Wonder
Did Aaliyah go to heaven on that last flight
Why you had to take pac after the Tyson fight
Did B.I.G. really have to go on that Cali night
In Heaven Im throwing a party on the first night
Get drunk and let Jam Master rock the mic
While Malcolm X and Dr. King sit down and talk
While Mike Jack show Rick James how to moon walk
Richard Pryor got everybody laughing
Out there chairs Bernie Mac where the devil at?
On the stairs, R.I.P all the cats that I miss
All dogs go to Heaven they ain't mad at Michael Vick
