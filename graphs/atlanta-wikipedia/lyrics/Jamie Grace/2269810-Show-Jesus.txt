[Verse I]
Your smile's always shining out
And they know what's it's all about
It's not hard for them to figure out
When you know Jesus
You know love is what they heard
And you didn't even say a word
Ain't it funny that's the way it works?
When you know Jesus
It's like flipping on a light switch when you're walking into this roooooom…
I got to tell you that I like the way
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
It's written all over your face
The way you love Jesus
And it always speaks to me
A little joy with a touch of peace
It's so inspiriing
The way you show Jesus
[Verse II]
When I'm feeling down on my luck
When life's hard and times get tough
You're right there to pick me up
When you bring Jesus
And ooohhhh…
It's like flipping on a light switch when you're walking into this roooooom…
You're so unmistakable
I got to tell you that I like the way
Anytime, anywhere, anyplace
It's written all over your face
The way you love Jesus
And it always speaks to me
A little joy with a touch of peace
It's so inspiriing
The way you show Jesus
