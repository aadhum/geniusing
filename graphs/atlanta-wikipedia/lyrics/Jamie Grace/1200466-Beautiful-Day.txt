[Verse I]
Wake up and smile
Cause it's been a while
It's been like a whole day
Since I stopped… so You could hold me
Lord you are the refuge
That I can't wait to get to
There's something about the way
Your sun shines on my face
It's a Love so true, I can never get enough of You…
[Verse II]
When trouble seems
To rain on my dreams
Cause You're showing me
In You I'm free
And You're still the refuge
That I just got to get to
So put the drop-top down, turn it up, I'm ready to fly
I got no need to worry
I got no room for doubt
No matter what's coming at me
You'll always be the Beautiful I sing about
There ain't no limitations
To Your amazing grace
On this beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Such a beautiful day
