I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you hold me
I love, I love, I love, I love the way you, the way you
I know I should be working but I'm thinking of you and

[Channel I: Jamie Grace]
Just when I feel this crazy world is gonna bring me down
That's when your smile comes around
I love the way you hold me, by my side you'll always be
You take each and every day, make it special in some way
Well ya, took my day and you flipped it around
Calmed the tidal wave and put my feet on the ground
Forever in my heart, always on my mind
It's crazy how I think about you all of the time
I'm so grateful and thankful for all you've done
Wish I could tell you in a short story or poem
But all I have is my voice and this guitar
And you have my heart
