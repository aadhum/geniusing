Good morning, cy-boys and cyber girls! I am happy to announce that we have a star-crossed winner in todayâ€™s heartbreak sweepstakes: Android Number 57821, otherwise known as Cindi Mayweather, has fallen desperately in love with a human named Anthony Greendown.
And you know the rules! She is now scheduled for immediate disassembly
Bounty hunters, you can find her in the Neon Valley Street District on the 4th floor at the Leopard Plaza Apartment Complex.
The Droid Control Marshals are full of fun rules today.
No phasers, only chainsaws and electro-daggers!
