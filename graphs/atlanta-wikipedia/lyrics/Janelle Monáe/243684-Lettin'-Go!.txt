Ooh, I got a call today from my job up the block
It was my boss to say, "You know we like you a lot
But we don't need you J, you daydream too much"
Well man, I'm glad ya'll let me go
Cause with no 9 to 5, it's a brand new day
My rent's due but I'ma party anyway
So I'ma let it go
Gonna leave my worries behind
Gotta take control
I just came to have a good time
I'ma let it go
No time for stress on my mind
I'm lettin' go
cameras, bright lights
I'm staying out all night
Don't shove, don't fight
Well make a million memories--all incredible
I feel so alive
Stress just faded away
It's time I live my own life
I just came to have a good time
I'ma let it go
No time for stress on my mind
I'm lettin' go
Oh, yeah, alright everybody
Now, I see ya'll jammin' out there
But I want ya'll to do one more thing for me, one more thing
Now, when I say L-E-T-T-I-N G-O!
I want everybody to repeat after me
On the count of 1-2-3! Unh!
(L-E-T-T-I-N G-O!)

Yeah! Come on we gotta let go!
(L-E-T-T-I-N G-O!)
Awww I see ya!
Now we gon break this down--
Like this!
(L-E-T-T-I-N G-O!)
Clap ya hands! Unh!
(L-E-T-T-I-N G-O!)
If you wanna dance, I'ma make you dance
If you wanna groove, I'ma make you move
Just keep dreamin'
Don't let your dreams die
You know?
Life is not a rehearsal
You gotta live it out
You gotta do it baby
You gotta do what you wanna do
Come on, somebody's gotta hear me
