Love is such a novelty
A rarely painted masterpiece
A place few people go or ever know
An underwater rocket love
Exactly what I'm searching for
If you're brave enough to go
Tell me so...
Say you'll go to nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
In the words of Dhammapada
Who will lead? Who will follow?
Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each other's hearts
Love is not a fantasy
A haiku written in Japanese
A word too often used but not believed
Witness the interaction of
The flood, the sea, the sky, the dove
Time erodes the shore but not our love
Say you'll go to nirvana
Will you leave Samsara?
In the words of Dhammapada
Who will lead? Who will follow?
Our love will sail in this ark
The world could end outside our window
Let's find forever
And write our name in fire on each other's hearts
[Instrumental]
