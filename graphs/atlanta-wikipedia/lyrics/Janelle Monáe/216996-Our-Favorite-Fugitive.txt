WDRD
Cindi Mayweather, Electric Lady No. 1.
I live in Neon Valley
I'm disappointed.
You're disappointed?
Disgusted, actually.
Really?
Yeah, this whole thing.
Really?
I mean, they should just do whatever they do to people like that.
"People like that"—what does that mean?
I mean she's not even a person—she's a droid just like all of you.
She's not a person. Well, you're right, she's not a person—she is a droid. She is an android Alpha Platinum 9000, and she is jammin'.
[Call #2]
power up, power up.
Power up. Mhm, power up to you.
Caller #2:
Okay. I'm a student at Time University, okay, and my name is Josh. I've been following you and Cybersoul and the whole Droid Wonderground for the while now.
And I just wanna know if you know, if you guys in android community truly believe that Cindi Mayweather, you know, is not just like Electric Lady No. 1 and all but like also the
ArchAndroid? Because according to the book of Zo—
Oh no, no, no, not on my show!
Robot love is queer!
What, what, what?
Robot love is queer!
Quee— What? Ohh, anything else?
That's all.
Uh-uh, I see. What I wanna know is how you would know it's queer... if you haven't tried it. Ohhhhhh! Here we are on WDRD Metropolis 105.5. We still alive. Everybody say, beta!
