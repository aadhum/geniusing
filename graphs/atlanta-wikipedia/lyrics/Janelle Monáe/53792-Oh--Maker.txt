I hear the drizzle of the rain
It's falling from my window
And in the corners of my mind
I hope that I'll get to see you again
La da di da di da di da di my friend
I hear the colors in the flowers
Just like the candle snuffed at dawn
You're here, you're near, you're there and then you're gone
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you, too
Perhaps what I mean to say is
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine
Oh, Maker
, tell me did you know
This love would burn so yellow?
Becoming orange and, in its time
Explode from grey to black then bloody wine
La da di da di da di da di
Oh, Maker, have you ever loved
Or known just what it was?
I can't imagine the bitter end
Of all the beauty that we're living in
Oh, no
We suffered a rare, rare blue
So much hurt
On this earth
But you loved me
And I really dared to love you, too
Perhaps what I mean to say is
Is that it's amazing that your love was mine
Lost inside a lonely world where lovers pay the price
Barely get the sound of music to love and go dance to
Your love's in my pocket and your eyes, eyes are in my
Eyes in my soul,
