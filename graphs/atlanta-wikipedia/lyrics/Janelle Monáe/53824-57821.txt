Early each morning he searched for her
'Til his feet became bloody and tired
The lock of grey hair that she gave to him
Stayed clutched in his fist through the night
One by one
It's your time
Lead them both back to one
May your light lead them both back to one
Indivisible sum
She wonders if he is the one
(You're the one)
Cold in the cell, lost and shivering
Gunshots in hallways unknown
On the fifth floor, past the blue door
a chained 57821
Sir Greendown told his dear Cindi
Fight like Achilles in Troy
"I will show you the ways that I love you
I saved you so you'd save the world
Cause you're the only one"
The sun has come
Here's the book now the saga's begun
I wonder if I am the one
(You're the one)
I wonder if I am the one
Anthony Greendown your Cindi Mayweather will always be waiting for you
(You're the one)
Just as sure as the sunlight keeps beaming on your eyes I shall always be waiting for you
(You're the one)
