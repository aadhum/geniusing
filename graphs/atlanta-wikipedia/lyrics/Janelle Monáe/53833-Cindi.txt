I meet lots of pretty girls
In this fantasy world
Waiting for their turn to shine
So I try to be Cindi
In hopes that they'd notice
But I wasn't their cup of tea
It's so lonely
When I'm only
Being me
So I talked to her heart
And made up her mind
That I gotta accept her for me
But it's still lonely
When I'm only
Being me
Oooohhhhhhh
You gotta be you
And I've gotta be me
