The way you are now
You're never gonna make the bus
You've got "Do androids dream of electric sheep?" under your pillow
I saw you spit on London just like you were Peter Pan
The way you are now
You're never gonna make it in my kitchen
You wanted me just for a holiday
Or was it to pad your resume?
They lied their way into my prism
I was molested by some hundred year old men
But all I saw was proof of God's boredom
And the dark effects of nothing natural
OMG! WGT!
Aww girl we been through hell about it!
Then I see our friends and...
Everybody's so excited!
