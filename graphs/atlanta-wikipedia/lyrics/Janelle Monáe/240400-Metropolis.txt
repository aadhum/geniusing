Dream to find another world
Where a cyborg can love and
a cyber girl is still a queen
Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
Where there's no war
If my dreams run a little wild
Where there's no call from Droid Control
Warning me against this disease in my heart
Free in my soul
Me, I live on the wired side of town
Reaching and searching for a space called paradise found
Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
Where there's no war
If my dreams run a little wild
Where there's no call from Droid Control
Warning me against this disease in my heart
Free in my soul
That wired folk can be sold and bought
To some it's a surprise when I smile
And when I hold your hand
Neon slaves, electric savages
Anthony Greendown
I've served you now about thirty-eight times
Thirty-eight times I've looked in those eyes
You see me laughing
The love when I hold your hand
I wanna take you
Take you with me to another land
Where there's no law
Tying my heart from the start
