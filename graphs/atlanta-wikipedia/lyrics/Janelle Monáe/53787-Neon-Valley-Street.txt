May this song reach your heart
May your ears love the sweet melody
Every note, every chord
I've arranged them for you and for me
For now, I'll pretend
I'm holding your hand
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song reach your heart
May this song journey on to you
We met alone forbidden in the city
Tubman
John Henry
Illegal aliens moaned
It's such a pity that the city's just a danger zone
like Iraqis in Babylon
The droid control will take your soul and rate it
Berate, slay it
You hate it and debate it but you don't get caught
An outlaw outrunning the law, ha
May the strings make you smile
May they always remind you of me
For now let's pretend
I'm holding your hand
