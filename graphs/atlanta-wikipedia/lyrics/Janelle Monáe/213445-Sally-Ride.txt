Take me to the river
My soul is looking for a word from God
Ooh, God
Like a rose in the cold, will I rise?
I'm packing my space suit
And I'm taking my shit and moving to the moon
Where there no rules
Wake up, Mary
Have you heard the news?
You got to wake up, Mary
You've got the right to choose
I tried and heard the pride
That becomes the very thing you see
Take a ride in the sky
It's just calling
But all your friends are gone
And the trees will burn while the comets play on
I wanna fly
Fly to the stars
Ride, ride, ride
Sally won't you
I know you love me but I'm still goin' (x3)
I got to make my peace
I got to move on
Just wake up, Mary
Have you heard the news?
Oh, just wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose
Just wake up, Mary
You got the right to choose
Real love
I wanna feel the real love
True love, ain't nobody got to steal love
Wanna know what it really means to be in love
Baby, gotta feel love
Sometimes I just wanna get away
Right now, going on right now
