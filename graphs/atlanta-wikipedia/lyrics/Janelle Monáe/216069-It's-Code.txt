Love is gnawing on my mind
Took my name, my site, my song
Been trying to find myself all day long
I heard them saying that love will be a curse or a restless friend
Love belongs in movies
Now I know I played with your heart
Cause when I turn back around I saw
You in someone else's arms
Walking around town, all dressed up making your move
Oh baby, it's code
Oh baby, it's code
I need a glass of Merlot Blanc
