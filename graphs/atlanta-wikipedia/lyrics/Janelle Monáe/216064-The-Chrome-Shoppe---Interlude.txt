Good morning, midnight. This is DJ Crash Crash, and I'm here at the Dark Park Metal Shoppe getting my chrome polished.
Y'all here know why we're getting our chrome right?
(Cause it won't shine by itself.)
Well tonight, we've got the Electrified Betas throwing an end-of-the-world cyber freak festival. Some funny subsistence for y'all to do. Don't let it break you now. Lookie here, we got the sisters looking good, shining bright, telling you all about it
