You, s-since that magic day
We've been like magnets in a play
We smash in then pull away
E-every day
You, you're a jet, a flying gun
You kill me softly with your sun
You melt my wings and call it fun
I watch my powers die
Falling out of starry skies
You kryptonite my life
E-every night
Oh the, the ending of the road
Dashing prince or horny toad?
Who really ever knows?
I should know
(Call me weak) Call me weak or better yet you can call me
(Just call me your hero) You can call me your hero, baby
