Tick-tock, I'm watching the clock
I can't wait til we get to rock
I wanna scream and dream and throw a love parade
Is that okay?
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't make a call, won't even write a song
See I've been waiting and waiting for the time to say
Now listen babe
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby our love will always keep it real and true
[Chorus]
Cause baby it's a prime time for our love
Ain't nobody peekin' but the stars above
It's a prime time for our love
And heaven is betting on us
[Verse 2: Miguel]
Bang bang, I'm calling your name
You're like a fire the world can't tame
I wanna riot til the stars come out and play
Is that okay? Okay
Tonight is me and you alone
Won't take a call, won't even write a song
This'll be a personal holiday
When you're down, and it's hard
And you feel like you've given your all
Baby my love is always right here for you
I know sometimes I’m mysterious
And you’re mysterious too
But tonight, I don't wanna be mysterious with you
