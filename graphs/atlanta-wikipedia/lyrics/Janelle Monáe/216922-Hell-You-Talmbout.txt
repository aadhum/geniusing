Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ohh
Bombs on the floor
Smoke in the mirror
Girls get their hair done
In electric jungles
Drunk man comes
Stopping the limo
He said he got a gun
But we keep on jamming on
Red, white, and blue
Here come the sirens
Only to dance
With the little girls on the corner
There's a war in the streets
Nobody speaks
And now a boy laying on the ground
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Coca leaf
From Indone'
Travels down
To ghetto streets, right to ya' hand
Hooking kids
Hooking mothers
To get you high
You're stealing from your brother's friends
The poor man eats
Off of rich men's dollars
The dope man, looking cool
He pullin' girls on the regular
But now he's in jail for life
Taxman dollars
Oh!
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ohh
Staying after school
Cause you wanna go to college
The burgers ain't paying off
And you be cussin' while you're cooking 'em
But still you bop
And push that mop
And dream about
The day you're finally free at last
Across the street
Limping lovers
Drinking summer fun
Snake eyes are gonna roll
We're laughing together right
Right when the shooting comes
Baby what the hell you talking 'bout
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Now what the hell
Hell you talking 'bout?
Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ooh
Baby, ohh
