Ooh, you shock it, shake it, baby
Electric lady, you're a star
You got the look the Gods agree
And watch the water turn to wine
out your mind
Ooh, shock me one good time
Glass on the ceiling
While the boys be catching feelings
Once you see her face, her eyes, you'll remember
And she'll have you falling harder than a Sunday in September
Whether in Savannah, K-Kansas or in Atlanta
She'll walk in any room, have you raising up your antennas
Wearing tennis shoes
or in flats
or in stilettos
Illuminating all that she touches,
eye on the sparrow
A modern day Joan of her Arc or Mia Farrow
Her magnetic energy
will have you coming home like Lassie
We the kind of girls who ain't afraid to get down
Electric ladies go on and scream out loud
