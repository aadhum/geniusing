Looking out the corner of her eye
As she sits alone and drinks her wine
That glow that’s in her eye
Gives you visions in your mind
She’s from another space and time
And when you touch her glove
She then becomes your drug
It’s too late, you’re hypnotized
She’s got Dorothy Dandridge eyes
And you love her, you love her, you love her, you love that girl
And you love her, you love that girl
Like a rare Picasso or Monet
The kind of beauty studied every day
