Look into my eyes
Let them hypnotize
These eyes long to make you a perfect work of art
Fall in love with me (fall in love with me)
Only then you'll see (Only then you'll see)
What these eyes have been planning for you
You lift my heart when I fly
Good morning, good night
It's a brave new world dawning, a lover's fantasy
Look into my eyes (look into my eyes)
Fall in love with me (fall in love with me)
And we'll both watch the sun kiss the sea
Fall in love with me
'Cross the golden sand
There's a road winding up into sun rays
