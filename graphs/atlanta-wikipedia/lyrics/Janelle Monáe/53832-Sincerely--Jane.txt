[Verse 1]
Left the city, my mama, she said don't come back home
These kids round killing each other, they lost their
Minds, they gone
They quitting school, making babies, and can barely
Read
Some gone on to their fall
Lord have mercy on them
1,2,3,4, your cousin's here round here selling dope
While they daddy, your uncle, is walkin' round, strung
Out
Babies with babies, and their tears keep burning
While their dreams go down the drain now
(While their dreams go down the drain now)
Are we really living, or just walking dead now
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?
The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more
Love, don't make no sense
Ask your neighbor
The winds have changed, it seems
That they've abandoned us
The truth hurts, and so does yesterday
What good is love, if it burns bright and explodes in flames
(I thought every living thing had love, but are)
Are we really living, or just walking dead now
(Are we walking dead now?)
Or dreaming of a hope riding the wings of angels?

The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more
I've seen them shooting up funerals in their Sunday
Clothes (Ya!)
And spending money on spinners, but won't pay college
Loans (Ya!)
And all you gangers and bangers
Rolling dice and taking lives in a smoky dark
Lord have mercy on them (Ya!)
Teacher, teacher, please reach those girls in them
Videos (Live your life)
The little girl's just broke, and queens's confusing
Bling for soul
Danger, there's danger
When you take off your clothes
All your dreams go down the drain, girl
Are we really living, or just walking dead now
The way we live, the way we die
What a tragedy, I'm so terrified
Daydreamers please wake up
We can't sleep no more
Lord have mercy
Have mercy
Have mercy
Lord have mercy
Are really living, or just walking dead now
Have mercy
We live, then we die
And we never know, thats why
We live, then we die
But never touch the sky
