I remember, ‘round Autumn time
I smell the breeze, I feel the sun
Old memories, come back to me
And I remember the smell of guns
War lived in me, but love finally won
I've been delayed, I've been denied
Then you came around and took the crown
We were unbreakable
We were like rock & roll
We were like a king and queen
I want you to know
No matter how the story's told
We were like rock & roll
We were unbreakable
I want you to know
I remember, a time alone
Wanted to dance, locked in your arms
Your melody, stays haunting on me
You were twenty-one, thought we owned the sun
And I remember, our plan to run
My rebel ways, and your utter nonsense
We’d go insane, but it felt so fun
And now your queen is on to take the throne
Kellindo help me sing it louder!
When Jamaica got way too cold (and your kisses warmed the sand)
