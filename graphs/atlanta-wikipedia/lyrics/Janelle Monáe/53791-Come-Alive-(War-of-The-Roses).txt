Tommy thinks the crazies are back in my mind
Tommy says the children are clouding my head
When everything is wrong I dance inside my mind
That's when I come alive like a schizo running wild
That's when I come alive now let's go wild
like a schizo running wild
You want to see me crazy taking my meds
And wipe away my noises you think I'm a mess
Take me six feet under, but while your roses died, I came alive
You better leave the town I'm coming for you
Call the Tommy up and tell him come help you out
I'm getting wild on you you better go and call the law
When Tommy thinks the crazies are back your mind
When Tommy says the children are clouding your head
When everything is wrong, just dance inside your mind
And you'll come alive
