[Verse 1]
I'm an alien from outer space (outer space)
I'm a cybergirl without a face a heart or a mind
(I'm a product of the metal, I'm a product of metal, I'm a product of the man)
See, see, see, see, see
I'm a slave girl without a race (without a race)
On the run cause they're here to erase and chase out my kind
They've come to destroy me (they've come to destroy me)
And I think to myself
Impossibly, wait it's impossible
They're gunning for me (that they're gunning for you)
And now the army's after you
(And now they're after you)
For lovin' too
Uh huh and all the sirens go doo doo
Sirens go doo doo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo roo roo roo roo roo roo roo
Ohh baby ooh you know the rules
(I love you and I won't take 'no' for an answer)
They say that Violet Stars will set you free (set you free)
When you're running lost and alone
Following them down up Neon Valley Street (up Neon Valley Street)
A pretty day makes a pretty picture
But fall in love and they're coming to get ya
Who knew 10 men with guns were at the door (at the door)
The Droid Control (THE DROID CONTROL)
Impossibly, wait it's impossible
They're gunning for me (that they're gunning for you)
And now the army's after you
(And now they're after you)
For lovin' too
Baby I hear the sirens go doo doo
Sirens go doo doo, doo doo, doo doo
Doo roo roo roo roo roo roo roo
*Sounds of escape and (*The Chase*)*
Look this way...Here she go, here she go
I see it...go this way, go this way, go this way... out the window. Out the window!
Don't let her get out the window!
