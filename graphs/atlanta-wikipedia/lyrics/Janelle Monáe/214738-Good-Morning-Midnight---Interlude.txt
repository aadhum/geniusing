Good morning, midnight
This is DJ Crash Crash
What’s up, y'all? I just want to say power up to the Droid Rebel Alliance and the Get Free crew
Yes, yes, sister, power up, power up
Also I wanna say The Droid Control can kiss the rust of the left and right cheek of my black metal ass. We gonna take to the club tonight and break some rules in honor of Cyn-di!
To the club, I love that, I love that! Which rule you gonna break?

We're going to break all of them. We're going to start at the top, and we gonna work our way down
They call me Ninja Bat Leeroy, otherwise known as BaBaBaSayWha! I just want to say that I’m tired of all these folks messing with us droids, kicking us all up in the head and wonder why we don't think straight. Messing with Cyndi, got this shit crazy. That’s why we're going down to Dark Park tonight! We're gonna hit somebody in the head! And we--
Woah, woah, woah! That’s that ignorant rusty-dusty nano-thinking nonsense I been warning y'all about. Please stay away from fools like that. Love not war, we are tired of the fires, quiet no riots, we are jamming, dancing and loving. Don't throw no rock, don't, break no glass, just shake your ass.
Ooh just shock it shake it baby with the Electric Lady.
