Early late at night
I wander off into a land
You can go, but you mustn't tell a soul
There's a world inside
Where dreamers meet each other
Once you go it's hard to come back
Let me paint your canvas as you dance
Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind makes love to mine
I think I'm a love angel
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants
The grass grows inside
Don't freak and hide
I'll be your secret Santa, you be mine
Don't resist
The fairy gods will have a fit
We should dance
[Pre-Chorus]
Dance in the trees
Paint mysteries
The magnificent droid plays there
Your magic mind makes love to mine
I think I'm a love angel
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants
This is your land
This is my land
You touched my wires
My supernova shining bright
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants
Take me back to Wondaland
I gotta get back to Wondaland
Take her back to Wondaland
She thinks she left her underpants
This is your land
This is my land
You touched my wires
My supernova shining bright
