Carry on, ghetto woman
I see you working night to morning light yet no one cares
Carry on, ghetto woman
Cause even though they laugh and talk about the clothes you wear
Carry on, ghetto woman
When you doubt if you’re a star, just know we still believe
Carry on, ghetto woman
Even when the news portrays you less than you could be
I wish they could just realize
All you ever needed was someone to free your mind
Carry on, ghetto woman
You’re the seventh wonder reigning over us at night
You’re the reason I believe in me, for real
Some say this ghetto land will take you down and poison you
Who said the ghetto’s just a place where queens dance naked on the moon?
When I was just a baby my momma dropped out of school
It was only second semester the baby due
"December the first, your due date"
She couldn’t imagine both of her daughters here all alone
Before the tuxedos and black and white every day
She’s the reason that I’m even writing this song
Let it use you, let it use you
When the love is strong
It won’t let you be alone
Let it use you
Just let the spirit lead you
