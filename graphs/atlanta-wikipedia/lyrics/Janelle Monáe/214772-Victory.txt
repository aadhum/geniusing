Today I feel so troubled deep inside
I wish the tears would roll back in my eyes
Will I rise?
Oh I'll keep singing songs until the pain goes
If loving you means fighting till the end
Then I'll fight harder baby just to win
And if tomorrow shall come to me
I'll count your every kiss as a victory
Cause to be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To be victorious
You must find glory in the little things
To win you'll have to lose all the things you know
Father take all the fears and sorrow from my life
Cause when the rain falls
My seed will grow
I'll be further to my dreams tomorrow
