I'm locked inside
A land called foolish pride
Where the man is always right
He hates to talk but loves to fight
Is that all right?
On real cold days
He loans us lots of hate
But he says that we must pay
To take it all away
Is that okay?
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know its rough and you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
And when I look into the future
I see danger in its eyes
Hearts of hatred rule the land
While love is left aside
Killing plagues the citizens
While music slowly dies
I get frightened, I, see I get frightened I...
Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay
Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay
She's quick to fight for her man but not her rights
Even though its 3005
When will we end this genocide?
And that's not right
Her children cry
No food to eat and afraid as flies
The color black means it's time to die
And nobody questions why
Cause they're too scared to stop them man
But I'm asking you will you stay with me
In this land where we are free
And I know its rough and you've had enough
But one day we'll be happy
Babies die before they're born
And no one ever smiles
The writers and the artists, all are paid to tell us lies
To keep us locked inside, they keep us locked inside
Oh how, oh how I need you baby
To keep me from going crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay
Oh how, oh how I love you baby
These people are so crazy
I really need you baby, need you to stay
I can make a change
I can start a fire
I can make a change
I can start a fire
