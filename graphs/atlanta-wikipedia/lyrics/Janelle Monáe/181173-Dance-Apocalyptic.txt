Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic
Bands they make her dance apocalyptic now
(AHHH!!!) Bands they make her dance apocalyptic
You're going crazy, the hitmen always finds you
Do that dance, smoking in the girls room
Kissin' French, itâ€™s over like a comic book
Exploding in a bathroom stall
She's so freaked out, worrying about the bomb threat
You bought a house, but I'm allergic to the house pets
But I need to know if the world says it's time to go
Tell me, will you freak out?
Smash, smash, bang, bang
Don't stop
Chalang-alang-alang
You gotta life, but the zombie's in the front yard
Take a bath, but nothing gets the funk off
You're on TV, rockin' and a rollin'
'Cause the dead just love to rock and roll
Sick and tired of food tasting plastic
You wanna cry, but they grew up without a real kitchen'
Asking why the pain is always equal
But the joy just never spreads around
Credit card, you're working and a-bobbing
Just to make enough to pay your rent
Look at you
You look just like a little old earthquake
Ain't no order in this courtroom
(Smash, smash, bang, bang)
Y'all going to jail
What's the matter?
Your chicken tastes like pork?
You have triplets instead of twins?
Is your food taste plastic?
Grandaddy, I think I wanna dance
