You can take my heart
Cause I ain't gonna need it on the run
[Chorus]
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat (oh, no)
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
Autumn, autumn's coming round
And summer's not the same
It's like winter without your smile
I can't eat
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat (oh, no)
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't breathe
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't be a day without your smile
You're the one for me but all the while
I just think that we should give all our love
Give love, love, love, love, love
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
No, I can't sleep
Baby don't you know, I can't live without your love
I can't eat
They say love is patient, love is kind
Love ain't weak, love is strong
