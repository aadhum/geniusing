Leftfoot
Some people talk about ya like they know all about ya
When you get down they doubt ya
They just talk about it, t-t-t-talk bout it
When you get elevated
They love it or they hate it
You dance up on them haters
Keep getting funky on the scene
While they jumpin' round ya
They trying to take all of your dreams
But you can't allow it
Then baby whether you're high or low
Whether you're high or low
You gotta tip on the tightrope
(Tip, tip on it)
T-t-t-tip on the tightrope (Tip, tip on it)
Baby, baby, baby, whether you're high or low (high or low)
Baby whether you're high or low (high or low)
You got to tip on the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
Now let me see you do the tightrope (tip, tip on it)
And I'm still tippin' on it
See I'm not walkin' on it
Or tryin to run around it
This ain't no acrobatics
You either follow or you lead, yeah
I'm talkin' bout ya
Keep on blaming the machine, yeah
I'm talkin' bout it
T-t-t-talkin' bout it
I can't complain about it
Like a star on the screen
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
You gotta keep your balance
Or you fall into the gap
It's a challenge but I manage
Cause I'm cautious with the strap
Do damage to your cabbage that
A doctor cannot patch
Why you don't want no friction
Like the back of a matchbook
Daddy Fat Sax
will fold you
And your MacBook
We gonna get back-up
Like the Dow Jones and NASDAQ
I tip on alligators and little rattlesnakers
Something like a terminator
Ain't no equivocating
Some callin' me a sinner
Some callin' me a winner
I'm callin' you to dinner
N-N-Now whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
Whether I'm high or low
(High or low)
You can't get too high
(You can't get too high)
I said you can't get too low
(We can't get too low)
Cause you get too high
(You can't get too high)
No, you'll surely be low
(No, you'll surely be low)
1, 2, 3, Ho!
Now shut up
now put some voodoo on it
Metropolis
If I play the ukulele
Just like a little lady
