[Verse 1: Janelle Monáe]
Gloss on her lips
Glass on the ceiling
All the girls showing love
While the boys be catching feelings
Once you see her face, her eyes, you'll remember
And she'll have you falling harder than a Sunday in September
Whether in Savannah, K-Kansas or in Atlanta
She'll walk in any room, have you raising up your antennas
She can fly you straight to the moon or to the ghettos
Wearing tennis shoes or in flats or in stilettos
Illuminating all that she touches, eye on the sparrow
A modern day Joan of her Arc or Mia Farrow
Classy, sassy, put you in a razzle-dazzy
Her magnetic energy will have you coming home like Lassie
Singing, "Ooh, shock it, break it, baby"
Electro-, sophisti-, funky, lady
We the kind of girls who ain't afraid to get down
Electric ladies go on and scream out loud

[Hook: Janelle Monáe]
Electric Lady, get way down
Cause tonight we gon' do what we want to
Electric Lady, get way down
Cause tonight we gon' do what we want to
[Verse 2: Cee-Lo Green]
Her smile is a special effect
Enough light to illuminate and entire earth
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
