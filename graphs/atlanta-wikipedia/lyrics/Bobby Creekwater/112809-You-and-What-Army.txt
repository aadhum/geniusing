You will be a weapon
A minister of death praying for war
Because I am hard you will not fight me
But the more you hate me the more you will learn (yeah)
I am hard but I am Fair
Try this on for size:
Grow up broke
Stand in the cold with a hole in your coat
Stay next door to a woman who smokes
A whole pack of cigarettes with a hole in her throat
My mama's in the church, high off hope
My uncle's in the trap,
my aunt don't know
My cousin went to school so she could be a writer
Met a nigga with some money and thats all she wrote
And here I am, runnin' these streets
Trying to find a bit of my identity
Meanwhile everyother nigga I knows getting money
Ridin' in the droptop like Kennedy
Fuckin' with all the young girls I like
I could be a hater but it ain't my right
I could could go fuck with the big booty girl, but
The whole hood hit her and she ain't my type
I came from the bottom, like it or not
They'll put a gun to you if they like what you've got
And why would yall ever give a fuck about me?
And why would I ever give a fuck about yall?
Theres no need to smell, I know I'm the shit
And where I come from, nigga, shit dont stall
And where I come from you can rob, rob rob
Be a little slow, be a little late
Just once
And how you Ain't never be slow, never be late?
You can't plan for no shit like this man
This is life
They say be humble and all that shit, but
How are you gonna be the man if you dont say?
I shall not stop, or reconsider
Call in favors, I don't waiver
I don't let a nigga disrupt my plan;
I don't let a nigga disrupt my paper -
[Outro]
Who's the judge?
Judge is god
And why is he god?
Because he decides who wins or loses, not my opponent
And who is you opponent?
He doesn't exist
And why doesn't he exist?
Because he's a mere dissenting voice to the truth I speak
That's right
I speak the truth
