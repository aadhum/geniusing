Bobby Creekwater, today's host
Today's narrator
An executive mindframe, fuck tryin to rap
Niggas represent a corner
Artesian water, this is flow untapped
The dream team, Bobby Creek, Em, 50 and them
We run the city like Diddy and them
The opposition we just pityin them, it's no chance
Put you niggas in the special olympics is no dance
Get them bitches out they pants, I did it with no hands!
See, one thing's for sure I'm pure uncut
Baby you can either stay down or get gunned up
Mr. Night Life, I can give you niggas sun up
a pocket full of stone ya
Ya dig?
Life is still a bitch but she a high class bitch
I'm here to end it
cooler
Than pigskin men base runners and hoop shooters
Oh nah, I don't bust a chopper but I used to
fans waitin on him
Like a, PlayStation 3
pressure bust pipes
And you niggas wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
