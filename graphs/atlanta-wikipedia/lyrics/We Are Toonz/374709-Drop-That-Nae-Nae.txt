Crank that Nae Nae, drop that Nae Nae
Work that Nae Nae, that's a Nae Nae ay
Nae Nae [8x]
Huah hunna hunna hunna hunna huah (x3)
Nae Nae that's the new thang poppin'
Got your girl over here in the corner and she jockin'
Yall guys out here stonin'
107.9 got our name all on the air
Yeah this Nae Nae takin' over
So y'all better be prepared
Ladies say this shit with me (Nae Nae) turned up on the beat (yo)
You ain't gotta dance we call it jiggin' on the beat (hold up hold up)
T-Double-O-N-Z, Nae nae'ing in the streets
Hands up! And a touch up in they face cause you don't care now one time
