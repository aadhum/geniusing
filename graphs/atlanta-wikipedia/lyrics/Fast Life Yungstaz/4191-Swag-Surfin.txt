Man I got that swag
My hat matches my bag
You know I'm popping tags
Cause man I got that swag
I'm on Hypnotic,
exotic
This Polo on my body
Got a bad girl beside me
Purple by the zone, yeah I'm smoking strong
Okay I pop off in the club with a pocket full of bands
Big stupid fresh like I'm wrapped up in Saran
And my chain shining hard it just gave my neck a tan
Pockets on Popeye cause they swoll of that spinach
Peachtree swag you can call me Mr. Lenox
Surfing on the scene like a young Kelly Slater
Patron, Goose, or Hennessy
They got it, I'mma drank it up
Cake on debit I don't hesitate to cash out
I spend it all
Paint John Stephenson, the black and blue Jag out
Pockets on half-time, I'm always bringing bands out
And I'm surfing like I'm Otto cause I got that Rocket Power
Gon' on Patron, taking shots like a camera
Flat screen, shawty, man I'm surfing like a channel
And I'm screaming cowabunga while y'all boys wiping out
Chain swinging hard like a boxer throwing punches
Shawty check my dougie like she Patty Mayonnaise
