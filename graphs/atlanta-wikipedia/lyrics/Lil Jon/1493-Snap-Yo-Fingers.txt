Drinkin' on some Rossi, dyin' off Patron
VIP style, strapped wit my chrome
Nigga where I'm from, we like to go dumb
I'm soakin' up the game, I'm seein' how its done
I ask shawty what they call it, she said the Pool Palace
Staright from Bankhead, I said you good at it
Chillin' in the bip, yeah we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these bitches gettin' drunk
Rollin' up the kush, put it in the air
I'm throwin' up the E's to let 'em know we in here
Yeah I'm from the 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
straight from the deck
