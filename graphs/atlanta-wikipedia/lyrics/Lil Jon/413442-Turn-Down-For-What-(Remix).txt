[Intro]
Fire up that loud, another round of shots

[Hook]
Fire up that loud, another round of shots
Turn Down For What
Smokin' loud on a yacht
Louis V everythang to my motherfuckin socks
And I'm living at the top
No ice in my drink, got enough in my watch
And these girls gon wild
Shots got us turnt up, so we can't turn down
VIP gettin' served like tennis balls
Bank accounts dizzy cause we spend it all
Gettin payed, turnt up, theres no better way
Amsterdam smokin I stay at the heaven gates
In the club and she goin off that snow white
Pourin up Actavis, I need more sprite
Throw this cash watch me start a riot
Leave the club then we take the chicks to the Hyatt
Still got my whole clique on a kush diet
Ass clappin on that money pilin
Your Majesty walkin through the magic straight
Pussy good I put it on a dinner plate
Leave the strip club for a dinner date
Tryna stop me from smoking like Nicko Ray
Everywhere I go I smell like a Marley
All the bitches with me look like barbie
I ain't wrote in a verse since Lee Harvey
I dress all my cars up Steve Harvey
She turn up and she takin them shots
And my watch is so big
You can see it from the parking lot
You know me I'm just lookin for thots
Turn down for what
You know when you hear that haaan
Montana, DJ Snake
I might pull up in the lamb' or the gat'
G5, G6 fly through anywhere
Let the mother fucker burn
Let the mother fucker burn
Made a mill, made another
what a feeling
I fuck a bitch, I'm floating all the money to the ceiling
I ain't cuff em,
i don't love em I ain't catching feelings
I fill this club up to the fucking ceiling
