Trap doin' numbers
Phone's going stupid
Put your order in
Nines halves deuces
We got pies flying out the spot
Open up the store and watch them come to shop
Trap goin' ham
Call us for an order of quarters and you gon' eat right
Trap doin' numbers on a daily basis
Wanna get a nine display them faces
got 'em yams
The trap keep a nigga fresher than a peppermint
