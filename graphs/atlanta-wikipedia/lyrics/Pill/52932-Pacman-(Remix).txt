[Hook: Rick Ross]
There he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
There he go, that's John Doe
And I'm still whippin' up a kilo
There he go, that's John Doe
All my power pellets turn you bitch niggas to ghost
Pacman, over 100 sold
Pacman, just order 100 more
Pacman, you can fry it in the pan
Pacman, in no time, you'll be buying land
Pacman, do it for your mom and them
Pacman until I get 100 M's
Me and Pacman just ordered a bunch of ones
you're
Ta- two seater got a bunch of work in it
They ask me what my name? I told them 2 Chainz
Ridin' with a hundred years
They sellin' work but ain't nothin' there
They sell us that we box em like a fucking square
Gucci shoes
Louis loafers
30 inches
Real G's gettin' cheese gettin' my packers on
