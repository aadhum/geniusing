I'm in the car rolling cow food, yeah
But I still keep a strap wit me
I ain't never been a slipper, that's a house shoe, hah
Got my education without school
Quiet as a mouse move but I keep a loud tool
Play games you'll be shitting in a pouch fool
Got stock like DOW do
New hardtop, off the car lot
Hit the gas, tires smoke like cigar shops
Tax on the work we got them H&R blocks
Alumni, yeah I'm from the school of hard knocks
Looking out for the 12 Roger Staubach
No cafe but we had them hard rocks
For the bread they'll throw you off of dark docks
So before ya heart stop, or the narcs knock
I gotta give it to you straight like a bar shot
Niggas mad cause you got more rides than the state fair
So I keep a lotta toys like a day care, huh
Hold the shotty like a bass player
It was my only wish to rise
It was my only wish to rise
Coming down clean,
bumping Ridin' Dirty, getting high
It's a mystery, break out ya magnifying glasses
Wit ya hat and fine jackets,
Who that on that new track wit that rap reclined backwards
Show this flow off like a trophy and a new diploma
Pack of paper, pen and pad and now calculate it
I'm bringing heat like old ladies when they is menopausing
Yeah, been at the lowest of my lows
That's why I get high hoping no one ever know
Independently self made and well paid
Three whips, one chain, no welt pain
When you treeing over niggas they gonâ€™ yell shade
They outta patience where I live cuz they sell weight
Avoided the temptation of crack slinging
But Lincoln Park had it looking like back in the 80s
And I was sweating hours trying to get the illest scholarship
Ain't have a pot to piss, I wasn't born rich
Leaving wit 8 bitches I need some octopuss
See how Wale go J4 DS
My lake shore whore never be on the BS
Bullshit, Chi-Town, riding around, top down
Hanging with the squares will be the reason niggas not around
Penny foams all blue
Or you could prolly use a nigga drive welcome to my car pool
Double MG shit,
G double O D shit
Five time foul niggas need to stop reaching
High as fuck with my down ass
Bitch roll to the Porsche from the bus pass
Indo smoke out my nose no mustache
Bitches I want but that money is a must have
Pay that up front like the Ferrari trunk
Stop talking so much
Soak it up next time you have sum'n to say
Butcher knives done died trying to be as sharp as us
See them niggas downstairs 'fore you talk to us
By appointments no walk ups
