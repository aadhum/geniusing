Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
Girl I'm winning, girl you winning, baby let's get it...Jenny
Pockets on Craig, I'm higher, I'm flyer
They mad, cause I ain't deny you, they gone hate
They gone try you,
my pockets on Weight Watch
My heart beat faster than a stopwatch,
I couldn't fucking leave
She was looking for me like a fucking cop
She throwing up signs, no stop
Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
I can't tell her nothing[8x]
Be quiet, I can't tell her nothing,
You can't tell her nothing, I blow bands on her
I spent lettuce on her, buy her yellow diamonds, she's a damn Corona
I'm geeked up
She got patients for me
And she ain't no hooker but she dancing for me
She accept my partner even though he a thief
And she like to hold my hand we in Lenox
I go slow like Iâ€™m screwed, I go fast like a semi
Baby you a turn on
Imma put my trust inside of your heart
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
I can't tell her nothing
