God damn, who the hell let rats in the house?
King of lions, who let these cats run out of the house?
Houston, Texas when I'm on land, I lean back like a couch
I'm not playin', I want it bad, call shots like a spouse
We roll that kushy up, we eat that pussy though
Suck it til you're throwin' up, my Phantom grey, no hound
still waitin' on that Bentley truck
I might stop by and let that little bitch lush
I pull up and chop at your cousin, your bus
Little nigga, you know what it was
She suckin' too slow, I'm impatient
My diamonds so wet like they bathin'
I might accept your apology
I mean you throw L's up if you ain't followin'
And I've been drinkin', I need to bottle this
I'm wearin' a top like I'm pimpin'
Your bitch want my milk
I'm sittin' at the top lookin' down at these wimps
These hoes just roll me a blunt
And you know that they stuff it, it cannot be imps
I based up my bankroll then based out my trunk
I might put her out and call Tyrone
Snoop Dogg, I might go ahead and bone
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the tight way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the right way)
I'm wearin' Maison Margiela (the scary sight way)
I'm wearin'  Maison Margiela (the goodnight way)
Take some sand to the beach
Party with a couple foreign freaks
Kim K lookin' ho, Yeezy
Florida livin' nigga, Pork N Beans
He broke, he servin' his squad with a scale
I make it rain, I hope all is well
I pull off deep like what in the hell?
Pull up in old school Chevelles
I don't save pictures, they might get revealed
How many times have I popped a perc pill?
Hey I worked so hard to get out that dirt
