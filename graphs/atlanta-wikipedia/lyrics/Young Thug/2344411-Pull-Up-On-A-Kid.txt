I know all my whips are foreign, I know all your bitches borin'
I know I gained me some weight when I was tourin'
Fresh and clean like a new born, I wet that bitch and then wet yours
I ride that beat with no insurance, what you tell 'em Thugger?
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, baby pull up on a kid (Skrr, skrr)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
You need to pull up a on kid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh she bad, damn she bad, yeah she bad, yeah
Michael Jackson,
Freddy Jackson check my jacket, yeah
Balmain jeans, extended tee, that my swag, yeah
Bad bitch, know I'm loaded, so they taxing, yeah
Write it off, hold it,
make her come back like she owe me
Oh lord, moved out of Miami now she think she's Zoeing
Fresh as a peppermint, threesome like sandwiches
Popping these Xannies and Percs, I'm dranking that lean and I'm smoking that good
Told that little bitch I want to see her topless just like a hood
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, baby pull up on a kid (Skrr, skrr)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
You need to pull up a on kid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm back, where I motherfucking left that
Minor setback for a major fucking comeback
Playing with my slimes, you won't make it out the exit
Mr. Brazy hoho, Mrs. Brazy hoho
Anybody get it, enie-meenie-mo'
I'm the same nigga used to pull up on the mail truck
If you ask me, it feel good
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, pull up on a kid
Pull up on a kid, baby pull up on a kid (Skrr, skrr)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
Pull up on a kid (Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up)
You need to pull up a on kid, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
