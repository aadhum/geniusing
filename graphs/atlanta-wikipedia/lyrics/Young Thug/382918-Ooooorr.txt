Roll the weed up
I'm in a Maybach
(Swamp Izzo!)
Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I said, "I'm anemic, too. A Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
E.T. phone home,
My blunts are long and strong
Anything you want, I'll serve you, boy
Because Big got cocaine and Willie got boy
And my whole crew eating 'round here
Ever since the day that I been bleedin' 'round here
Big Duck, please kick your feet up 'round here
Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I said, "I'm anemic, too. A Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
I'm a Sak's 5th, Lennox Mall, Neiman Marcus shopper
LV, double G, D&G popper
And them niggas you see me with, just know they watchin'
Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I said, "I'm anemic, too. A Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
Labels keep calling me back and forth
When I get the messages, I call back some more
And if these free bricks fly, I'm flying for her
And I put my ice on her, she said "Baby, I'm anemic"
I said, "I'm anemic, too. A Neiman Marcus shopper"
We fly, helicopter
