You dig what I'm saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast, yeah
I’m a boss, fuck that bitch out on the balcony
I might take a picture and tell 'em to caption this
When I'm done fingering, I need a napkin and shit
Ocho Cinco, yes sir I’m catching it
Catch it, catch catch it, catch it catch it catch it
I'll take your necklace, I'll leave you neckless
I'm screaming bring it on like Gabrielle
Don’t think he quick he pulled up like a snail, oh
Water in his eyes, I let that sucker go
And I forgot to tell her that you were po
I’m not doing a 20 year sentence about you, you a ho
I go crazy, I go brazy for these fucking bands
Fuck a lady, I replace her for these fucking bands
He so crazy, I’m not lazy, I want fucking bands yo
And I got on Chucks but Young Thugga not stuck
Swear, swear swear, I swear I'm slimy
I might screw you bitch with my broke pliers, nigga
Hell yeah, I'm YSL 'til I'm dead and pale
Kickin you niggas, getting money slow just like a snail
I can never be him but you can wish me well
I came a long way from shopping at clearance sales
And dig what I’m saying?
If they all hundreds I'ma count it fast
Lil' mama digg what i’m sayin
