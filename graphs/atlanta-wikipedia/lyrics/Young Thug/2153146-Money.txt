London on the track bitch!
[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want that money nigga
I don't give no damn about no fame
Plus that lil bitch got a pink pussy like a yam
I'm icy so she failed to maintain her lane
I woke up with a smiling face
Lil shorty keep following like she down to play
I can't fill my truck up with no fucking strays
But I can fill it up with all my bass
And that's no lie that's no lie
I'm balling so hard I need Gatorade
Eat your candy now and later
[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money (I want racks)
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money (Bring me all the money)
I just want the money (I just want the money)
Bring me all my money (Uh)
My jewelry wet like water hose
I swear I'm back in my John Dillinger ways
[Hook]
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
I just want the money
Bring me all my money
