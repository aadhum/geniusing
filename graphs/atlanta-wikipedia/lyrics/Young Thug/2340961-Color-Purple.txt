Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ey, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Drinkin' color purple, smokin' color purple
Bring it over when I'm nursin'
Draped in clothes like some curtains
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ey, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Lil destiny, no child
I'm purple just like a flower
I'm only purple just like a flower
Hey, Oprah Winfrey bring me that color purple
Ey, Danny Glover bring me that color purple
Oh, double cup fill it up with color purple
Color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
Bring that color purple
That color purple, bring that color purple
Bring that color purple, color purple, color purple
