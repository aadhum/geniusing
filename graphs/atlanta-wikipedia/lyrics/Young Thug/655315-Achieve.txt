And I'm Su Woo but I wrote this with a blue pen
I guess the ice got they main bitches skatin' on me
Thug go in, curfew
If Wayne flow is kush, then my shit is on purple
corner
I'm at the tip top, ain't no toppin' me
Sippin' on this mud got me bobbin' and leanin'
Now they sayin' I got the big head like Stewie
Now I ride drop head flyin' down Cleveland
And if ya'll ballin' with the bands we Spalding
no ceilings
Bought the new Bentley coupe, the roof I had to fuckin' kill it
