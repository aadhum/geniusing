I thug for life, my nickname Makaveli
She braid my hair, R. motherfuckin' Kelly
She shave with Nair, pussy sticky like jelly
We in the Air Force, they call us Nelly
And this real Thug, yup it came from Jeffrey
Yup, my molly see through like jelly ..  fish
Fuck you too good, wake up the neighbor, neighbor
I'm a Young player, need a pimp cup, that for real
A youngin' thuggin' with a .38 to hit ya
This ain't a plastic gun, this thug life nigga
We from Jonesburg South, no strap no trap
When the doors swanging, just Bentley put yoppa on 'em
2013 drop top, just to pop on 'em
Thugger Thugger, ya I seen, Forgiato no limp
He got a lot of suckers mad with they lip out
That's why I stand extra there with my clip out
I'm a Young player, need a pimp cup, that for real
