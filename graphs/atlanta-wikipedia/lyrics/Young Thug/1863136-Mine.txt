Up in niggas towns with my Zoe Pounds
Wet diamonds in my mouth if I kiss her she drown
If I leave a nigga white T-Shirt red
It'll be a peppermint or a baseball nigga
I know they sick and tired of hearing bout my jewelery
But if it fall on the ground
Yeah you might just slip and fall nigga
Your bitch says she wants a tall nigga
You are one midget you too small nigga
She suck my dick and rub my balls nigga
Yeah my jeans they blue dolphin not no SEALs man
Nigga how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
I remember on the block I was serving them dimes
Yeah, how the hell you gon' tell me what's mine?
And them boys they had no dope I was selling you mine
Nigga, big bands on my mind nigga
Nigga, Catch these ones like the swine nigga
Twin dimes and they mine, fold em like a pork rind
I know bloods that rock burgundy, no wine
In the back of the car screaming YSL hold it down
Yeah, hold it down till he come back off on an appeal
That's the real deal
I'mma eat that pussy down then I'mma roll up some kush straight out the fields
I told her straight to her face if she don't do it I know someone that will
I don't want to drink no lean with these niggas if it's not double sealed
And that's the real
Nigga big B balling no budget
And my car is rare like a mullet
Bitches bome up to my room and they get slutty
Bitches ball me Jeff and the F stand for fuck it
One more time for my jewelry, yes it's flooded
