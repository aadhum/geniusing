Beat a nigga head with a Louisville slugger
Shoot a nigga dead then feed him to the gutter
Beat him, like a little bitch I treat him
It's on, on sight,
like this I greet him
Pow! Talk that shit, nigga, now
Get your ass gunned down, nigga, this my town, I run it
Pray to God, may I die, let 'em fly on my opponent
Hol' up, we will roll up, hop out of that Corolla
Spitting this AK outchea, at your chest until it blow up
I suffocate you, smother you, I ain't gon' leave you no wind
[Hook: Young Thug]
Eww, eww, eww
Eww, eww, eww, eww

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
What you gonna do when I pull up on you, nigga?
(I don't know, I don't know, I don't know)
Pussy nigga know that he a cat like Tigger
(For sure, for sure)
Beat the pussy nigga with the baseball bat
Pull up with them F&Ns comin' out the hatch
Pussy mothafucka scared to say it to my front
So I'm blowin' out his back
Point it at his liver, make the nigga reconsider
Bands in my pants got me lookin' a little bigger
Red just like Elmo but I never fuckin' giggle
You can suck my pickle for a nickel

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Zuse]
Yeah, I'm bout the spinach, boy, Popeye
Swat a pussy nigga if he that fly
Ice cold nigga like a motherfuckin' gem
Cut a nigga off, ain't tied up for them
Ballin' on 'em, got my hand in the rim
[Hook]
