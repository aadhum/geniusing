I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian
Told my baby next February we're married
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
[Verse 1: Birdman]
Yeah, we roll these bitches like they centipedes
We get this money, flip some hundreds then we blow some Gs
I gave her life and then I showed her Bs
Inside of the car, we stashed a hundred bricks
We put it down and hit the town, we 'bout the money trips
the dope is colda cause we're polar, bitch
Two, we 'bout that woop like them brand new Spyders
I'm bangin' green like the lizard in Geico
I pull up and wet you, burn your top like Michael
I got bullets bigger than fingers in rifles
It's big Bs with a hundred Gs in each one of my pockets
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian
Told my baby next February we're married
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
Whippin' that snow, no Alaska
Good head, she got her masters
I drink that Act while you be drinkin' red
I don't fall in love, I run over it instead
I keep my pistol I'll give you the lead
They 3 deep I call 'em Ed, Edd and Eddy
I'm gon' beat that pussy up just like a champion
I'm a beast inside these streets like a barbarian
Told my baby next February we're married
We laughin' at these pussy boys, they're so hilarious
I might get him knocked off, pull some spaghetti strings
I might get him knocked off for a double sealed pint of lean
I might get him knocked off while I pull a bank scheme
I might get him knocked off for just tryna join the team
