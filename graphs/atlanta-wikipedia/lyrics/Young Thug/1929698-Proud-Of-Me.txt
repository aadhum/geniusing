Cause I wouldn't tell
I'm scared
Of you and what you can get done to me
Please free La Flare
I know he gonna be proud of me
Take care of that pussy, scared to go in it like woods
suck my banana no pudding
Bitch get your stems out these woods
You know lil' mama got good
Nut on her teeth no bullshit, me and her up to no good
If she ran her mouth, nut inside her mouth
Jump in it no kangaroo
give the bitch a pouch
dog, Chow
Free Gucci!
Have a private party Billy Boolin'
You know I'm banging red like a nose on a deer
Why wouldn't I claim her when I put 20 bands in her ear? (icy)
They work at Follies, boy you know they righteous
I been had a check but I still don't like Nikes
