I keep my bankrolls, I don't treat her like she kidney
I need them chickens
Bae, I need chickens
Mama, I need chickens
I need some chickens
Diamonds pinker than a pony, running with 26 chickens
Thick drink, purple maple, I coulda went and bought some acres
I ain't talkin' to the boxer when I say A.B
Home of the falcons no football
Plug, plug, puttin' them birds in the box
Putting them birds in the truck
When I pull up to the town, know that I got myself pounds
Burr, burr, burr, burr, burr, burr
Thugger Harry Potter fly, boming soon
kidney
