Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I just finished doin' some business with the hat back
snap back
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
Treat her like a Bentley, take the top up off that bitch
I got hoes drinkin' syrup like a waffle on that dick
I made all my pockets grow like Pinocchio, lil bitch
Either way, money'll grow, just know I'm tryna get rich
Baby, I bought that Audi and I gave it to my mother
These niggas, they cowards, they won't even kill each other
Even though I got rhymes, I bust shit just like a bubble
Treat her like she got tatted, she comin' with all that head
Not a big fan of acne, but she like it in her face
Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
I just copped the coupe, it came with twin turbo
Diamonds 'round my neck, they singin' like they Kirko
Thugger got me swung, got drinkin' all this purple
And I got 'em billionaires in my circle
I got old money like when I played Atari
Cash Money, nigga, I know Birdman
Got a Rarri with the engine in the back
Every neighbor know a nigga servin' crack
Chasing cheese, but I can not be a rat
Screamin' free Gucci Mane, no Mack
snap back
I'mma hit her with this wood, no mouse trap
