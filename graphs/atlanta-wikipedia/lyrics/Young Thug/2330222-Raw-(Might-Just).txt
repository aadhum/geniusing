These nigga's knock off diamonds are shining
But they ain't blinding
No pizza bitch I got banks in my pockets
Where's the ladder I'm climbing
She gon pop, lock it and drop it
I ain't talking wrist but she watching
Me right now, hundred bands stuffed in my jeans right now
YSL, there's no "I" in "team" right now, no way
Beating the block till the sun come up
I'm rocking gold like Rols-R-Us
I talk more shit than Damien does
I put the steel up in stain lil cuz
Throwing these bitches straight off of the boat
We don't save them
Hey, a wise man told me nothin'
He said them snitches they get stitches
I just spent a Bentley on my kidneys
Saying I gave my bro the address to road to riches
I, I might just take care of bae
Yeah, I might just make karat my ladies
On my worse day she a 9 like Brady
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, she love me, she love me, love me for that
Yeah, my love is so big she can't lose that
You can have my son
We eat ching chong, diamonds they go boing
by the way
Beep beep beep like a bus on that ass, so big
I swear to god I'mma fuck her now her body getting big
I swear to god I'mma do everything that I ain't did
I, I might just take care of bae
On my worse day she a 9 like Brady
