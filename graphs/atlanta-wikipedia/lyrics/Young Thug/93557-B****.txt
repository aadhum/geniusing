Get behind them closed doors no tellin' what they gone do
Hit that bitch one time and pass her to the homies
Now she can't stay off of me she like a Piranha
And she say I taste sweet like the candy called Mambas
Yum!
Other people want some or a little or one
But she ain't gettin' shit unless she suckin' dick or hittin' splits with nothing on but lipstick
I'm not J Money bitch I don't won't that sauce on me
Talkin' brazy like I ain't blood like baby
Let me stop cause she keep sayin' she savin' me
From her uncles like they can't find lil haiti
