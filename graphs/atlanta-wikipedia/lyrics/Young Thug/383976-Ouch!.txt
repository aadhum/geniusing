You keep dat bullshit on yo mind
You keep some bullshit on yo mind, man
But I'm gon' help you take it off(take it off)

Hundreds, thousands, millions, OUCH!
Hundreds, thousands, millions, OUCH!
Hundreds, thousands, thousands, OUCH!
Wet a nigga polo t-shirt up , 12 think he spilled wine
Popped me one more capsule I'm higher than scotty , no lyin
But you gotta be silent. Girl, you know we in the lobby
Colonial flow, im just tryna get my bread right
Do not play with me, know it stay wit me
