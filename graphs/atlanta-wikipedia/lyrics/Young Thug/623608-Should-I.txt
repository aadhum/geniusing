To unlock, but it never unlocked (no, no, no, no)
Should I leave, should I leave? Should I stay? Should I go?

That Texas tea spillin' on my jeans, outfit

Then I come back to my senses like
Get the fuck up out that YSL sofa

Fuck, trap spots tucked down with the mouses
I live my life stoned, no mountain
Then she switch up like Hannah Montana
Couldn't ever understand her
