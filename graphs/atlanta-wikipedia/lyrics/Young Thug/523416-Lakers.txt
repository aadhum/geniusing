I'ma run it up to the sky like a skyscraper
Drinkin' purple and yellow, feelin' like a Laker
Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team
I'ma run it up to the sky like a skyscraper
Drinkin' purple and yellow, feelin' like a Laker
Drinkin' purple and yellow mixed just like a Laker
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team
I'ma run it up to the sky like a skyscraper
Livin' life like a Laker, rings on me like a Laker
We started bein' goons, now we kings
I'm a young rich nigga with the same team
