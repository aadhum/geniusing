I spent a hundred on my fit and it’s by Hundreds
I bangin' blood but all my hundreds, they blue hundreds
Keep it one thousand, I’m one thousand, I’m ten hundreds
I'm a dream chaser, I'm chasin' nothin' else but money
I'm a dream chaser and I had a dream 'bout money
I bought that brand new Rayful Edmond then I went and saw my bitch
Out in Paris with my niggas, bought some bottles
And I know, shit, all my niggas 1 hundo
They was down when the money used to come slow
You ain’t come for the money, what’d you come for?
Got a 7th in the Sprite, but I want mo
Me, Milly, and yo bitch, that’s a threeway
Roll it up, don’t smoke it, this persie
Came from the dirt like a [?]
Actin' like Arthur DW, boy you done with
