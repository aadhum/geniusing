People pull up in the Bentley and hop out
And air your ass out and say sorry to children
Squeezin on innocent bystanders
That’s what they get for just chillin'
First you was dissin', now that boy missin'
Pillow talkin' to these bitches
But when he see me he quiet like detention
Pussy niggas I see right through 'em
Shoot him in his pat like Ewing
F&N meet a nigga fluid
Now the little nigga can’t urine
Hating on a nigga, I can’t do it
Meanwhile he hating, YSL getting yay, screaming aye
What you doin'?
I'mma treat him like Section 8 put his ass in his place
I'mma look a nigga in the face, make him turn Christian like Ma$e
Only say one word and it’s “Aye”
Then I'm gon' rearrange his face
Hit him with 3 like Reggie Miller
He not bout that Percy Miller
When I catch your ho I dick her
