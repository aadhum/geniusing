56 hundred for the Cartier
YSL shit, know I'm sayin?
Me and Lil Duke
We gon' fly high like an eagle
I sold them hunnas and eagles
Beat up that pussy, no nerve in it
Bitch say she straight like a perm in it
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
My pocket, it look like a book with the worm in it
I roll up, I pull up with shorty
I pour up a four of the muddy
I pour up a four of the muddy
I lean, I lean on my luggage
Got Aquafina, it's nothin'
I fucked that bitch while in London
I beat that bitch like I'm London
Man I'm gettin' so fly like a seagull (drrr)
And I'm ready to die for my people
Bitch I'm a Zoe, not a zebra
I cook up the dope and no ether (ah)
Bitch I'm the shit, fuck a toilet
Farrakhan, me, I'm a leader
I was just smokin' on doja
Fuck niggas trick 'em and treat 'em
Pour up a four in a 40
We drop a four in a liter
I pour up a four while he cook up the blow
I just got the blow and it came off the boat
Got racks inside my skinny jeans and they pokin'
No hokey, no pokey, fuck nigga you're broke as shit
We gon' fly high like an eagle
I sold them hunnas and eagles
Beat up that pussy, no nerve in it
Bitch say she straight like a perm in it
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
My pocket, it look like a book with the worm in it
Lil Duke rollin' 60
Thot bitch, she crippin'
I drink on the Act all day
I got a hell of a kidney
YSL, I'm bangin' that 'til they bury me
Bitch I'm Sudan, I got planes on my steps
Yeah, we make it snow in the VIP
Gats on our hips and we totin' in here
Racks in my pocket, they know what it is
We gon' fly high like an eagle
I sold them hunnas and eagles
Beat up that pussy, no nerve in it
Bitch say she straight like a perm in it
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
Bentley Spur with the curtain missin'
My pocket, it look like a book with the worm in it
