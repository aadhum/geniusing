I don't fuck with 12 cause I heard they were listenin' to a nigga's conversations
I got it tucked in my jeans, and I got my nigga Thug with me
And he gon' tell you get the fuck out my face
Boy get the fuck out my face
Y'all get the fuck out my face
Please get the fuck out my face
Someone get him out my face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
Please get the fuck out my muh'fuckin' face
I'm the real Tony Montana
Call me with the deal like a fuckin' pickle
I hate that we the next superstars boy
If you don't know why, tell 'em Quan
Future Billie Jean reincarted
And I ball before the Hall of Fame, James Worthy
And I'm drinkin' on Magic, yellow purple
