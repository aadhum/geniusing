Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
So bad I swipe my Visa, Visa, I want
No homo, but my blunt look like a dick
How ya doin? This for my neighbor, Carmelo
Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
I'm too up, I get the birds for like ten-a-piece
And therefore, I'm on the road, I know she missin' me
But I'mma leave early to take her ass to Tiffany's
Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
Baby I want your pizza, I want all the toppings
Baby I want your pizza, pizza, I want
