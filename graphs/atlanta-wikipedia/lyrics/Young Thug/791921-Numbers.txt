Got my broadie London in this mothafucker man
I go up up up and away
And I got old hundreds, they wrinkled like a Shar Pei
And them boys in Atlanta they don’t play yeah
And them boys from Atlanta tote them K's yeah
And them boys from Atlanta got bananas for these monkeys nigga
prisoned
I got bands in the bando
and I'm beating David Banner
And I’m smoking on cabana,
leanin', movin slow as grandma
now it's thunder
All my diamonds come in yellow like a Funyun
Yeah all my gold made 'em sick and they can vomit
I'm growing green, me and Chi-Chi, no pet
I'm chasing dreams, free Meek Milly
And them boys in Atlanta they don't play yeah
And them boys from Atlanta tote them K's yeah
And them boys from Atlanta got bananas for these monkeys nigga
Fuck nigga tripping, I'll get prison and fuck your father
Brand new 24's
You's a busta, mothafucka rhymes
Wait, let me pick up his remains
Hold up, hold up, wait
And them boys in Atlanta they don't play yeah
And them boys from Atlanta tote them K's yeah
And them boys from Atlanta got bananas for these monkeys nigga
