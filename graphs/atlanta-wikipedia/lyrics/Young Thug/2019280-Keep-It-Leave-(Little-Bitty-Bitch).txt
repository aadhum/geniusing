Hey, we sip codeine, nigga, leanin' it
I cook that white like Britney Spears for ya
Buy her YSL and now she loaded
Twenty Escalades and ain’t none of them cost
Nigga rich, talk a whole lotta shit so I had to name my son Richard
No J but I’m a rockstar
First off you can't see me so how could you be me?
