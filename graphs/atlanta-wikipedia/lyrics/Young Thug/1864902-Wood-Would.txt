Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Ballin' like I'm spalding, bitch I'm only startin'
Hawks game, Thugger on the wood
put this log in her life, no wood
I won't be a pet, no counseling, I'm gon' make it work
I'll shoot but I ain't talking no bird
And now she on me like a perc
My fuckin' weed smell like a turd
I just made 10 mill off of merch
Got my weight up
I must’ve been eating my beef and my broccoli
Man I don't hit the mall, they shop for me
Rastafari, smoking on Marley
Mama I'm sorry, got it in order hey
Ballin' like I'm spalding, bitch I'm only startin'
Everything I say I do it, Hawks game, Thugger on wood
Running my money up for all my kids and my niggas
Bitches dont try me they know I bang red I can’t never be cuz
Don't care if you cousin boy it’s disrespectful if you call me cuz
Come get your bitch off my dick, sucking my blood like a tick
She know I'ma bring out the sauce just like Chipotle
Rastafari, smoking on Marley
