Pull up and wet up the city don't care bout no feelings
I shoot at ya children
Pull up and kill him don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds
I'm going far as a star, you afraid of heights, the sky is my limit
Your bitch is sweet like a lemon
Beverly but not the center
Ten thousand dollar toe ring right inside of my sandal
My bitch think she dreaming cuz I grabbed the Tommy she thought that I grabbed on my stomach
Cook so much dope it's startin'a look just like Comet, it could make a young kid vomit
