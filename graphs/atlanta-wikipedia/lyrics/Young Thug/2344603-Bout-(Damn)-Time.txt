We came a long way and that's why I say
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy
I done ran that money up, bout time
I used to stack a five, now I'm stacking dimes
I don't care if none of y'all ain't my kind
Your watch cost 5000, you wasted your time
I supply real niggas and they show me love
gives
cook up a four
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy
These bitches know I wanna fuck 'em all
Young Money shit
horns bitch
I buy her CC, then I turn that shit to BB
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time, bout time
Bout damn time, I swear to God
God damn time, ayy
