Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along
I'm living that YSL lifestyle
We living that 1017 lifestyle
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie
(money talk like Charlie Sheen)
Fold his pussy ass up just like a centipede
Count so much money with my thumb, everything I touch turn green
I'll make your white t-shirt feel like Miskeen
I'm living that YSL lifestyle
We living that 1017 lifestyle
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie
Now I'm shooting Tommy Gun (with a rag)
Hit 'em with the golden gun, James Bond's son
I'm living that YSL lifestyle
We living that 1017 lifestyle
We living that rich nigga shit lifestyle
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie, get along, get along
Get along, little doggie
