Diamonds work magic like a genie
Your bitch, she got a butt-head, Beavis
You know I'm kickin' shit like Feely
I really want your cat, no kitty
no speakin
You know a nigga Slime like the deacon
So, I'm only fucking you for the weekend
She said she need a hundred just to begin
Shawty wet, but she ain't a sea fish
Make your girl gimme that turtle neck
Hundred bitches boolin' on the dock
I done spend two hundred on the clock
Don't think I'm a jay when I wear rocks
