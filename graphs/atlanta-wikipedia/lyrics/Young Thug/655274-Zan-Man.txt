I thank God that I am not racist
Shout out to Wayne cause he is not basic
patriot
And I've been in and out the bank bitch
While ya'll assholes been in and out a tank bitch
I think I'm on my Wayne cake shit
And you're just like the bricks, we get rid of you
How the song got Universal still neglectin'?
Schooly then
Juggman
And I be with my dogs like a hunter
And they ask me why I still respect Jimfro
Cause he the motherfucker that made me, is you crazy?
And he asked me why I had two babies
Cause I ain't lettin' a fuck nigga clone me, is you crazy?
