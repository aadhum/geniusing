[Intro]
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'
I give a damn if you care, I'm an astronaut
Shitted on them nigga like I was constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'
I give a damn if you care, I'm an astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not
YSL status

Ugh, ugh, ugh, kuh, blat, Suwu red chuck
Converse, Slash that Bonverse
Pass that... that loud that concert
Whoa, whoa whoa, Losie voice, whoa
[Hook]
I pulled up on the block, I'm speed racin'
I give a damn if you care, I'm an astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
I'm ballin' I don't care if you care or not
Spaghetti, out the strainer
Cocaina
Ryu, Ryu the fuck nigga gotta fight by you
Stay in the kid place, nigga, Caillou, Caillou

They swoll like I know the Klumps

[Outro]
I give a damn if you care, I'm a astronaut
I shitted on 'em like I'm constipated
