Thugger
Hey, hey you, come here! Come here ho
I mean, I eat you alive
Come here
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
I'm cryin' wolf,
Sorry, my diamonds are yellow No Coronas
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
I'm with a bad bitch, she look like she from Baywatch
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
Grab a Swisher Sweet and stuff 'em with them grammies
I'm a thug, I swear I told you niggas
And I ain't Young Money but I'm above you niggas
