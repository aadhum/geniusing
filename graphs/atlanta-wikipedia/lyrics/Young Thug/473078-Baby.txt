baby,
S.L.I.M.E.
Shoot a missle, no toes
All the muscles comin' out the hip, tell â€˜em "Off the rip"
I'mma try to hit the pussy nigga in the hip
You tryna show out, in front of a freak, now you the R.I.P
Faygo cream soda my choice, hear it in my voice
Yo' main bitch wanna hear my voice, it make her moist
Hit that cat from the back and watch it make a weird noise
Niggas excited by these bitches, them them weird boys
So many bands in my pockets, I need zippers off clothes
These niggas hiding these bitches, they got zippers on hoes
All of my dogs bangin' red like Clifford
Two bands on my Louis scarf as big as a quiddilt
January to December, I'm screaming baby! Yeah
baby,
S.L.I.M.E.
Shoot a missle, no toes
A cell ain't gon' hold me for life
But I know these ho niggas gon' tell
But this chopper gon' make him get right
It's beef soon as I serve it
baby,
S.L.I.M.E.
Shoot a missle, no toes
