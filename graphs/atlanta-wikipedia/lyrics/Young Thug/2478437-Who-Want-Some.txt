So sick, I'm broke, I filled my prescription
Right to the bank, now my pockets look terrific
ABC, I'm about to come
50 racks spent on the futon
Ride with them Birds like Julio Jones
Take a nigga bitch, who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Telling me they can't be me
They can't see me, oh
I'm balling, they can't D me
I got black ice on my wrist nigga
No I don't play no games with 'em, no-no games with 'em
If he ain't red I don't bang with em'
Who the fuck wanna try me
Who the fuck wanna try me
Telling me I can't be me
Can't see me, oh
I'm balling, they can't be me
