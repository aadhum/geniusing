These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
I'm a coach, I keep a red flag
And I promise you can't stare at my jewelry, it's like a flash
You square like a graduation cap
And I guess I'm on a Six Flags' ride, cause I'm strapped
I am not wack
And if a nigga play he get beats, Nitti
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
And this is Ace of Spades, that's a bowling pin
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
These niggas ain't shit, baby, we are
And you might catch me with a hundred xans, tar
And I'm high as fuck, plus I'm shining, star
Baby, we are, baby, we are
