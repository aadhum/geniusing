My trigger finger just itchin' (x4)
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
That 40 on my waistline
I got that 40 on my waistline
So don't play with my cause I don't play with you
Out my respect I'll come lay with you if that's okay with you
But we don't play basketball, bitch there's no take back
And all my niggas strapped up everyday
No candy but you know everyday is payday
My trigger finger just itchin' (x4)
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
CRE , cash rules everything around me
Oh, damn she don't take molly, I'ma take some for you
Boom , Boom , Boom , Boom C4 Bro'
You get caught up on the road, say you John Doe
My trigger finger just itchin' (x4)
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
My trigger finger just itch, trigger finger just itch
