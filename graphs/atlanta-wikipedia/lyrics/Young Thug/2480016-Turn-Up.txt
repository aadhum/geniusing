Turn up for the club (turn up, turn up)
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Alright just turn up for the club
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Electric slide, baby slip and slip and slip and slide, slide, slide
Turn up on the side, turn up side to side, side, side, side
I know what you like
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock side to side
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock front to back
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride on this side
What, walk, walk, walk, walk, front to back (Thugger!)
Fuck you slow in the fast lane
Suck me up 'til I'm crashing
Crash into your pussy
Chains on and it's gushy
All these niggas be wishin' they was in my position
Thugger, Thugger, Thugger!
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Alright just turn up for the club
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Electric slide, baby slip and slip and slip and slide, slide, slide
Turn up on the side, turn up side to side, side, side, side
I want green like a lettuce
Black tiger, white Jag
Bitch I'm ridin' with old lady
Nah I can't Skype back
But I can late night that
Mayweather, I fight that
And I don't even know her, really
Break her jaw like I'm Gilly
Two years, four milli'
I just want a sore kidney
Got it and she know I'm gettin' it
I don't wanna talk about it
I just wanna be about it
I just wanna hit it once
You can let him do it second
Balmain with zippers on 'em
Yeah this a private pocket
Turn up for the club
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Alright just turn up for the club
Turn up for the club
Just turn up for the club
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Turn up in the front and turn up, turn up in the back
Electric slide, baby slip and slip and slip and slide, slide, slide
Turn up on the side, turn up side to side, side, side, side
