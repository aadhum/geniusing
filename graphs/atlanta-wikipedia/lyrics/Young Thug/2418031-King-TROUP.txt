[Intro]
I just asked God why he called for Troup
When it's time to ride, if you love 'em, nigga, prove it
You know all your lil' niggas gon' shoot shit up for you
I thought I seen a ghost because your son look like you fool
King Troup
Action
I hop out, I'm dabbin'
My old lady classy
We onto this fashion
My coupe sittin' on Davins
My faculty braggin'
My briefs, they high fashion
I pour up a four and got more
I'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole
I came a long way from the stove
I hop in the foreign, go slow
Iced out, ain't no time in it, oh
Oh-oh-oh
I just beat the case
I hopped out the Benz
I just fucked some twins
Pulled up in the Range
Got drank in my cup
Like I'm Kirko Bangz
From ashy to classy
Keep up with my ice and my fashion
I take care of my kid with a passion
I pray to God that they stay happy
Lil Roscoe, he sleep where it's nasty
They could've freed him cause he grew up with no daddy
But instead they took advantage and did him badly
Ain't give no fucks cause we were seven
Got a camera from the club and that's all they had
(Free the Goat)
They also knew that lil' nigga didn't have a wagon
(Free the Goat)
Damn
Action
I hop out, I'm dabbin'
My old lady classy
We onto this fashion
Hop out with a bad bitch
My briefs, they high fashion
I pour up a four and got more
I'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole
I came a long way from the stove
I hop in the foreign, go slow
Iced out, ain't no time in it, oh
Oh-oh-oh
Stop it, stop the killin'
We, we get millions
We together, get the cheddar (get them racks)
Fuck them niggas, keep a Beretta
Let 'em have it
Ask God for forgiveness for them babies
You know Slimes with it, baby, baby
Stack them racks up to the ceiling
Keep 'em mad and that's how you know you doin' good
Keep embarrassin' them with racks that look like books
I'm so finished, with these bitches
I need me a real one, I need commitment, where ya at?
Action
I hop out, I'm dabbin'
My old lady classy
We onto this fashion
Davins
I pour up a four and got more
I'm cold as the North fuckin' Pole
I came a long way from the stove
I hop in the foreign, go slow
Iced out, ain't no time in it, oh
Oh-oh-oh
King Troup
