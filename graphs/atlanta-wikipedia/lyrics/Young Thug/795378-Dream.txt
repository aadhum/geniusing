When my diamonds speak, they say "bling" (yeah)
Yellow diamonds, no crime scene (yeah)
This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits
Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick
I don't give no damn if they throw it off, I won't fuckin' miss
Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown,
wouldn't talk to him 'bout shit
(Ya dig?)
I want you to talk to the hand while I talk to bands
I might gone and stop playing, take over the lands
My money long as school buses ain't talkin' no Xans
50 dub, know I'm sayin'?
100 bloods in my fam
fuck the beach, I got sand
PS3, I'm not playin',
go gentle on my lil' man
I'm booted up, I could land
My car is fast, I should drag
Versace white, Ku Klux Klan
Don't care if he's Crip, he still fam,
And I wanna be like Mike and I ain't talkin' Phelps, but
When my diamonds speak, they say "bling" (yeah)
Yellow diamonds, no crime scene (yeah)
This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits
Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick
I don't give no damn if they throw it off, I won't fuckin' miss
Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown,
Hey how you doin'? I'm Yak Gotti,

That's my compadre
And we solid, oh so solid, if I get caught I won't say nothin'
YSL, bitch we mobbin', I'm forreal, this beat knockin'

When my diamonds speak, they say "bling" (yeah)
Yellow diamonds, no crime scene (yeah)
This that rich shit, I eat fish and grits
Catch me boolin' with my dogs, just like Michael Vick
Bitch I'm so up, no Sleepy Brown,
