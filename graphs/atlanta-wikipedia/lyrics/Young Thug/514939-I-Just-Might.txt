I just might spend a whole milli
I just might throw to the ceilin' (c-note)
I just might spend a lil' dub today
I just might spend a lil' twenty
I just might spend a lil' million
I just might fork up a billion
I just might come out there broke today
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hunnas
I might just turn to a stunna
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a hunter
I might pull up in a Honda
I just might get to these riches
I might go broke with these bitches
Whippin' the dope, ride the pot like a peg
Nigga got the whole rock under my feet
If I ever take a trip to the chain gang you know they embracin' lil' homie
You should go down on your numbers, my nigga
You overexaggeratin', plural on it
I just might spend a whole milli
I just might throw to the ceilin' (c-note)
I just might spend a lil' dub today
I just might spend a lil' twenty
I just might spend a lil' million
I just might fork up a billion
I just might come out there broke today
I just might come out with fifty
I just might come out with hunnas
I might just turn to a stunna
I might look like anacondas
I might fuck my homie's mama
I might dress up like a hunter
I might pull up in a Honda
I just might get to these riches
I might go broke with these bitches
I be like "Hurry and buy"
I'm an angel in the sky
YSL
Smell like flowers, she's the bomb
I just call her "Lotus"
I just might spend a whole milli
I just might throw to the ceilin' (c-note)
I just might spend a lil' dub today
I just might spend a lil' twenty
I just might spend a lil' million
I just might fork up a billion
