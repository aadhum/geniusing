I got lots of haters
I spend sheets of paper, I need me some paper
Famo need that flavor,
Verse 1: Birdman
You know I'm bout my paper, you know I'm bout my team
You know I'm bout my family,
if I don't make it in a instant
I know the Freeband Gang from that six
Nigga having bubble eye lens in a muthafucking new Benz
All my bloods, they surviving off us
Pappadeux's with her lips,
Baby girl I swear
If you can't stand no more I'm gon give that ass a chair
I do her wrong and I know she gon' still be there
Tell a nigga cut the plug
Can't see me like the muthafuckin' shoe that a bride wearing
All my bloods, they surviving off us
Pappadeux's with her lips,
