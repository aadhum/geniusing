I call lil mama Makaveli she gon' ride with me
Mama booty thick as some bread I need some thighs with it
I'm like 'Ed, Edd n Eddy' baby I try with it
My P.O. tripping and shit man
So I can't smoke so I'm just drinkin the fuck out this drink you know
Popping them motherfucking Percs nigga
No Xans, no downers nigga we up
Fuck you mean
Hustle hard, million views without a machine
She don't remember nothing good but she remember tenders
Nigga money stacked up like Ludacris afro
When they say they bout to leave I'm like baby don't leave
I'ma run it up even if it come down to selling weed
spray all over her all summer
Cartier swag on my face, no nerd
I don't like talk bro tell em no words
Akeem mink no '80s
Hundred thousand hoes on my Avi
we chop that bitch lil boy you tripping
I'm the realest nigga Notorious BIG
bookin' while Iâ€™m acein'
Hundred thousand Pirus
Twenty thousand dollars on a smile no anger
