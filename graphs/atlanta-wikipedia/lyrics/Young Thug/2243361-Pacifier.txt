Cut the chase, I wanna nut in this place
And I know she liked a nigga taste, I can see it in her face
Now don't make me a cute little Christian, I don't feel like Ma$e
When I fuck her I'mma turn her, turn her over
Turn her, Turner like Ike
Pacifier, pacifier, pacifier
Nigga need a pacifier, pacifier
Shake your rumidi bum bum
Bleed the block, bleed the rock
Bleed the bumbaclot rock
Bleed the cops
Bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed
Damn, climbing up the pole because she put a little split in it
If I whip the dope up I'mma put a little whip in it
When I whip the dope I'm lookin' to break my wrist the way I'm spinnin' it
Bought the little bitch a black mink like George of the Jungle, she's a ape
Nigga hotter than the summer
I sell Miley Cyrus
ain't no meeting Miley Cyrus
You get Miley Cyrus can't eat nothing for weeks
So pass me a molly, no
Pacifier, pacifier, pacifier
Nigga need a pacifier, pacifier
Shake your rumidi bum bum
Bleed the block, bleed the rock
Bleed the bumbaclot rock, bleed the cops
Bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed
Nah it ain't Drake but my community gated
My niggas eat for no reason, they feast for no reason
And I'mma pull up in the 9-11
Then I'm pullin' back up in the Drophead
Make her drop pants, make the bitch drop dead
When it come to this shit, I'm a Pro, no Ked
Drinkin' on this Easter pink, I feel like an egg
Attracted to these drugs, I feel like a fuckin' fed
Where the fuck the Sprite at?
It's a baby bottle, not a
Pacifier, pacifier, pacifier
Nigga need a pacifier, pacifier
Shake your rumidi bum bum
Bleed the block, bleed the rock
Bleed the bumbaclot rock, bleed the cops
Bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed it, bleed
You not ready, need you a
Pacifier, pacifier, pacifier
Nigga need a pacifier, pacifier
Pacifier, pacifier, pacifier
