I got me a K in this place
Baby, don’t play in this place
Bring them racks out the safe
Go to church like Mase
Put a mask on my face
Beat the case in my case any day!
My cup gotta be muddy, that’s all
I might catch a nigga, bitch and fuck her right on Gresham
Bitch, I am a monster, I know I am a lil' ugly
I might pull up with all of my jewelry on like Busta
Got a unique body, my clothes, get ‘em from Russia
I might eat it, I might beat it like Mike Ikes
Treat that pussy Tempur-Pedic, and call it a night
And therefore I love her
My partner in crime, she won't tell like her mother
She know I'ma go over C's like a Blood
Go to church like Mase
Fuck a nigga bitch
Grabbin' on my dick
My cup gotta be muddy, that’s all
I wanna hit that middle like a mullet
I can see straight through you like a bullet
Shawty want my closet like a hood
Fuck all of my fellas, no good
Bitch I am a tiger, no wood
I done see more hoes than Tiger Woods
When she with me
Every time she sees those racks she wants a son, nigga
You know my cup is pink, like bubblegum, nigga
Fuck a nigga bitch
My cup gotta be muddy, that’s all
