Aye man get your mutherfuckin hands away from my syrup man
Livin life bro, I'm happy
All of these rappers I swear they watering down and I'm the chlorine
Feed me, feed me
These pussy niggas tighter than a wedgie, weegee
I live life like a sniper, they can't see me, see me
Her heart like an old diaper, I can't leave it, leave it
I'm drinkin' on this motherfuckin' mud
Okay my fuckin' back pocket is fat like a butt
I swear I'mma blood, I can never be your cuz
(Mumbling)
I'll bippoty-bop, then stick it and fade
I keep some coke and the rocks on me everyday
Come here tempt me if you wan' go on a date
I'll make bail within' the first 48
I'll give her the stick
She gone get a clip, bigger than a porn star dick
And I need new casting, for a porn star clip
Momma move to 85 north, not 85 south
I think these hoes piranhas, excluding my baby momma
If I ain't treat you good little baby just know it's karma
You did my nigga wrong, I know it, it was last summer
Lyin' to me, tellin' me I'm the bomb like Osama
I wish I could spend 50 bands on tour for grandmama
Niggas sit on the bench and I said do ya'll
YSL scream "fuck the rest" cause we got right now
That little bitch ask for a purse and you know I said "Yeah"
She gone act just like a clerk when them feds in there
She might act like she know Bird when them players in there
