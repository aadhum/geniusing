I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner!
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner, I'm a stoner
I'm a motherfuckin' stoner
boss
I'm high as hell ain't got no satellites on me
I believe my train of thought is cuckoo
I've got a locomotive
In Atlanta where, so much damn Versace
I've got ...
I've got fats on
I'm like a young quarterback
Running, quarterback draws million of yards
'less you police, don't look too deep beneath the
corner
