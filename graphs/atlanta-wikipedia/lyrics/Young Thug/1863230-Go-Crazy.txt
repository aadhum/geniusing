I can't trust these bitches
I can't trust these niggas
I can't trust a falcon
I can't trust a chicken so just
Boot me up, boot me up
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Goddamn take away this ache, I-I meant that Act
Goddamn girl have my back
Even though my money taller than Shaq
Old Nat's
Perc's made me beat on her, no whippin'
But the molly make me shine like P. Diddy
I been... geeked out my mind since I was
Like 14 years old
Girl you know I...
I can't tell you "Bye", but
You tell me "Bye" all the time
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
And I started on E
Yo' bitch get in front of them
Yea, I'mma Bick Back wit Stunna and them
Boot me up, boot me up
I'm a nigga goin crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watching me go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Watch a nigga go crazy
She watch a nigga go crazy
Why watch a nigga go crazy, baby
