You make me go brazy, I know you won't judge me
My bankroll big like a bouncer
pop that pussy like a Snapple
Bitch I'm bleeding, where the napkins
Body red like an apple
Still prepared for them arrest, YSL we goin wrestle
Benjamins, Grants talk back, I be like "who is that?"
They be like "where you at?", meet at the Valet at Sax
I flood my bitch and I don't care what they say about it
You just a diamond in the mine and you dirty
I like my bitches brown like James, no Worthy
Scratched out the alphabet, 'cept B bitch
Whoa, she standing naked bookin' bhicken
Whoa, I need them thick thighs on my chicken
You know, just got dropped off by Scotty Pippen
