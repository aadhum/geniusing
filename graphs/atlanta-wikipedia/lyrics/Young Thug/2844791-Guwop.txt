I done put 20 up under the Sig...
I done put 20 inside the Sig
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid
I pull up your block and I pop at your wig
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough
I count my backend and I turn up the show
I dig everything that you sayin'
I dig everything that you doin', too
I dig the way that you look at me
You dig the way that I look at you
I just wanna grab on your butt, but
The seat in the Benz, the Chanel Clutch
The FN, it give him a haircut
That big booty bounce on the dick and it broke
I don't gotta act like a gangsta and she know
My Backwood look like a pole, yeah
My Backwood look like a pole
I see 'em clouds of the smoke
I'mma blow pounds of the smoke
In that hoe mouth like a Colgate
Keepin' that cold case, God, please give me that cold case
I done put 20 inside the Sig
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid
I pull up your block and I pop at your wig
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough
I want hella Xans, they get me off
Pull up in that coupe shit, nigga like damn, where the roof went?
In the streets, they call me Jay Z, lil bitch, I got the blueprint
No nigga, I don't want no old hunnids, you know I want 'em blue strips
You dig that? 200,000 worth of chain and that's a fact
Got my name in this rap game by sellin' crack
Rest in peace to OG Double D, you dig that, slime!
I done put 20 inside the Sig
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid
I pull up your block and I pop at your wig
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch
Since I was a youngin' I been gettin' dough
I want hella Xans, they get me off
Shoot out the roof (Shoot out the roof)
Now you can say I got millions
Swam with the sharks, water (Splash)
You be law and order (12)
I be gettin' money every mornin': Tom Joyner (Uh)
I am the plug, cordless (Brr)
Pull up with blazers, Portland (Brr)
I came from nickel, I came from Nichols
You dig me like shovels, I gotta fuck with ya
I done put 20 inside the Sig
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid
I pull up your block and I pop at your wig
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough
My wrist is a faucet (Watch)
Feed 'em perkies, I'm the doctor (Doctor)
Stallin'
Look at my fashion
This is a Gucci rugby
My diamonds be dancin'
I done put 20 inside the Sig
I pull up on you and I pop at your kid
I pull up your block and I pop at your wig
I hopped out the Coupe and I'm fresh as a bitch
Since I was a youngin', I been gettin' dough
