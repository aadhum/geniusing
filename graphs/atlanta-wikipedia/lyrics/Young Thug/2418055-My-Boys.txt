Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Had a talk with Thug, we was talkin’ bout Escobar (Pablo!)
Snitches the only thing a rich nigga stressin’ for
Remember we was riding on the MARTA bus
They'd rob the bank before they think ‘bout robbing us
We did this shit ourself, we ain’t ask for no help
He’ll kill for Terrell, I’ll kill for lil Jeff
Ridin’ ‘round with them straps, I ain’t talkin’ seat belts
I swear to god I’ll murk ‘em if Thugger say the word
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Rip LA, what's up Booka
No Metro Boomin, I'm boomin’
One call, they pull up shooting
Too turnt up for Lil NuNu
My niggas demons voodoo
They facing shit like ooVoo, yeah
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Edgewood, Zone 6 shit, rated savage
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
Met that bitch when I was in elementary
Man them my niggas before elementary
They been my niggas ever since elementary
I swung on his teacher ‘bout him, yeah in elementary
When you buy you a Bentley, you know you rich
Me and Ralo, we like Ace Boogie and Mitch
He was broke now his shit lit up like he hit a lick
It’s YSL, and Ferragamo shit
Lil Durk with me, tonight we throw the racks on the bitch
Light him up like he Christmas
If he play with my boys
