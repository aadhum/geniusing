I don't stack that shit by the four ‘cause I’m not a shrimp
Like my daddy or the school, I might listen to it
I can go around the bitch like equators baby
And she from L.A. just like the mothafuckin' Laker baby
Imma fire shots off like I know Brian Nichols
I just might ride or die for my niggas
They talkin' life sentence I'll try with my niggas
And I will beat trial with my niggas
Flaws and all,
Rosé goin right inside the kitchen
She eat the dick so much, I ain't never seen the bitch in the mofuckin' kitchen
Like a “d” we can go straight overseas
Put purple in my brain just like a leaf
