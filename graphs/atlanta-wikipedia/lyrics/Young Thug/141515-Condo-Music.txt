I'll shoot at you and yo' ho like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
I'm sittin' at the end while you still beginning
I love her friends
And even at a concert, I'll show a nigga
Or just like double seals, I'll pour that nigga
My birds soft, my ho a spouse
Feed me, feed me
I want a whole grammy, I wanna hit yo nanny
I'll take another .5 now I'm the last standing
I call him Damu Nick, cause he stay with that cannon
And he gone sit in your front yard, even if you was Stanley
I'll shoot at you and yo' ho like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
I love her friends, I love her friends, oh yeah
Yo' girl suck me up, she suck me up like she work on porn
You ain't gettin' paper that's a personal problem, it ain't my fault
I'm on 4 different drugs, shit I'm high as a loft
Keep a closet full of work, ain't no such thing as drought
'migo drop 'em off, we get 'em in and we get 'em out
I'll shoot at you and yo' ho like a porno movie
I'm always high, call this condo music
