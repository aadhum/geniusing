I got more hoes than Kanye West clothes
Fendi with Prada, need no stylists I dress clothes
Dressing in style and Pat Rileys
Black nigga at the court counter there with a mink coat on
Call her at Popeyes, we can link up later on
Nigga aired out the spot now we can't link later on
I was teachin' my dawg like I was Blues Clues aye
I just popped a molly now I'm going back in
I don't like leeches and I done had enough of these leakers yea
If Texas love was a drug (You’d belong to me)
If Texas love was a drug (You’d belong to me)
If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug
If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug
Drug, drug, drug
I gahdamn
Sell the fuck out
I mean I wouldn't be able to keep a pack
You know what I'm saying
How you digg that
I can kick game like the Pied Piper
YSL Denzel sniper
Hundred bands in the damn Bible
I got a hundred bodies and they all idols
Made a million dollars I'm amazing
That's a massive foul nigga flagrant
Got on hella chains like a slave bitch
And I'm at it never comtemplatin'
Nigga gripping tan up the damn street
R.I.P. to Bankroll Fresh street
The Maserati like the Kash Doll
When the drought come bring them bags out
I'm in LA bring the plaid out
If Texas love was a drug (You’d belong to me)
If Texas love was a drug (You’d belong to me)
If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug
If Texas, Texas, Texas was a drug, drug, drug, drug, drug
I said if Texas love was a drug
if Texas was a drug
