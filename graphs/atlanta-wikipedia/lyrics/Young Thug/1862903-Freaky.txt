She slime like the deacon, she slime like the deacon
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
She got just a Harley and a star just like Hardee's
Eh, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Eh, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie
Hey, I'm on the third base and you away (That means I'm home)
Hannah Montana, my nigga gon' cook everyday, yeah, they bake
I apologize if I pull up in that new coupe wrapped in 'Ran
I apologize if I post a picture posted wit' some bands
I apologize if I go and grow me some pot in Japan
Where your bitch at? No, not that one
Baby want to touch my milk like she cowin'
Every time you see me, I'm a have thousands
On the island, no dressin'
I won't taste it, you got no man, I hope you a free agent
I'm a big old Blood inside that little ol' nation
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
Eh, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Eh, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie
Eh, I pull up and arson all over your garden
Eh, I'm never gon' call you, I'm always gon' ball you
Now I'm bleedin', need a band-aid, on a rampage wit' 'em AKs
Nigga, jewellery real gold like an Ace of Spades
Higher than a escalator any day
But I ain't talkin' 'bout no coffee, she got double Ds
Even if you had Erykah Ba', you couldn't do us
And I ain't never been a rat, but I'm livin' ruthless
But I got them racks up, now they Luda, yeah
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
Eh, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Eh, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie
Five thousand on Yeezys, they think I ain't Jesus
Get my ice out the freezer, it cost a lil' Beamer
She think he adoring cause his pockets on Norbit
I'm Michael, I beat it, I'm keepin' your secret
I got more hoes than Pleasers, the one that's on Bleveland
I hop out the 'Rari, I'm leaving it started
Eh, you play with her garden, she smoke you like Marley
Eh, now she be my darlin', yeah, she be my Barbie
