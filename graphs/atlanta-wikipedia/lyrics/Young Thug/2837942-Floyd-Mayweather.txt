Little bitch, you ridin' niggas' dick like a bitch, damn
Little bitch, you ridin' niggas' dick like a bitch
I got, six brand new foreigns on my wrist
I got six Forgiatos on my fist
I got fifty foreign hoes on my dick
I'ma nut in all 'em hoes, let's have some chicks
Nigga tried to hit a lick and missed
Tried to run then I caught him like a fish
I'ma catch his ass with the whole clip
I'ma beat they ass up like Ron Artest
Pussy nigga ran like a Miss
[Gunna + (Travis Scott)]
VVS hit off that G Star V-neck (yeah-yeah)
Chop the top off that Stringray Corvette (yeah)
I'm sellin' purple rain, RIP to Prince
When I was behind the fence they treated me like a prince
So much jewelry on, her pussy gettin' tense
1017's the ones you don't wanna diss
And you can never be like 'Wop you little snitch
I'm from Custer East Atlanta, yeah the 6
I make one brick turn to two, I know a trick
The walking lick, my chopper is my walkin' stick
Everybody got they passport ready to dip, Europe
UK 25,000 dollars on a trip
Aye, okay, Lil Dora said I was born with a skill
All I eat is lean no lie and pills (oh my God)
Put that, put that in my girl (straight up)
Makin' porno videos and takin' stills
Turn that, turn that to a film (drip)
Yeah anywhere we go (yeah)
I bring the snow
I fill your nose (straight up)
Ether,
howdy my mamacita
Stay away Lucifer, she sexy in that all white beater (yeah)
Lately I've been flyin' on them Lears
Flyin' cross the world,
Flood her bank account with bands cause she feelin' me
Nigga cash on delivery
If it's a snake on my clothes then it's double G
I don't like police hoes, ain't no cuffin' me
All my diamonds dancin' like they Bruce Lee
Check out my smile I got some new teeth
We at the Clearport, you niggas never there
Bitch we blowin' gas, roll me up a spliff
I sip it till I sleep, I might overdose
Piercin' in my nose, diamond in my nose
Giuseppe open toes, diamonds on my toes
I just got a family pack of Jimmy Choos, damn
I just bought a chopper and I'm ready to use it, damn
Boy you sell the molly
