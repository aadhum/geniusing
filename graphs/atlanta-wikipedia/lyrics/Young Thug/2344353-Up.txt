Wheezy what the fuck brackin', nigga?
I might need Be El Be for this one
You dig?!
Whoa, we tore up
I'm like 'baby don't throw up', if she ever hit the ground
Young Thug not pickin' her up, you can Quicker Picker Up
Cause I'm a blood, pass me my bup
How the fuck I love when I never like em - ooh
Bitch I am a genie, I got hoes in Magic City
I need an Aaliyah she gon' rock all on my boat
My chain small but only my weed make me choke
Hey come here baby girl I want that amateur throat
And when I get through I pass it to all of my folks
Damn they got my name on the Coke
Blackjack got me winning by the boats
And my weed orange like a fuckin' cantaloupe
Hey I don't like 'em black, no spades, no way
Whoa, we tore up
I'm like 'baby don't throw up', if she ever hit the ground
Young Thug not pickin' her up, you can Quicker Picker Up
Cause I'm a blood, pass me my bup
smoking loud like a Dually
And I pulled up on your bitch and the children
I just spent a band on cologne, I am on, so on
They was watchin' me back in the days like a Sony, promise
Whoa, we tore up
I'm like 'baby don't throw up', if she ever hit the ground
Young Thug not pickin' her up, you can Quicker Picker Up
Cause I'm a blood, pass me my bup,
