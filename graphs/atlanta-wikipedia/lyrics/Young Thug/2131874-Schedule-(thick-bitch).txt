Boy I done been to a hundred islands no dressing
Baby I'm the king, Elvis Presley (king)
Suck my mother fucking Nutty Buddy (nutty)
Riding round the city with my daddy (psh)
Real gold on, bitch, I need a Grammy
Fuck I'm too geeked up I need some dabbies (rrt!)
Boy I done been to a hundred islands no dressing
Boy I done been to a hundred islands no dressing
