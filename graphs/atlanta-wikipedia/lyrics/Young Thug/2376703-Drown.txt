(Drink!)
Take a lil' sip of that Ac' (blow it)
I'm in the projects without Pat
My jewelry leave them blind like bats
Diamonds for her in the back
Pop a lil' Xan' and relax
Biitch, all of my whoadies hit that
Take a lil' Perc, and relax
These niggas up to something
Drink  ohhh
Take a lil' sip of that Act (blow it)  ohhh
My jewelry leave them blind like bats  ohhh
Diamonds for her in the back  ohhh
Pop a lil' Xanny, and relax  ohhh
Bitch, all of my whoadies hit that
Pop a lil' Perc and relax
