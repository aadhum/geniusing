I pull up, hop out
Riding around with that Glock out
I'm just ridin 'round and I'm getting it
Cruising through my city serving three-five for the fifties
Put diamonds in my teeth so talking ain't cheap
Hundred deep inside the club, pack that bitch down like sardines
Oh my god nigga try you luck, spray your head with this AR 'chine
No homo, two times, no homo nigga
