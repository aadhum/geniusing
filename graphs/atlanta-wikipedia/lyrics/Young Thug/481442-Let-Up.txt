[Intro: Earl Nightingale & Young Thug]
Fish scale?
Iâ€™m on a Harley David, I got a choppa on my seat
I got them nines on my feet, nigga shut up
D Kizzle got my spot fizzle with bizzles, can you dizzle?
Yeah, Dk got my spot filled with bitches, can you dizl?
Bitch ain't got no class
You know we call her truancy
I drink that Actavis, yo Sprite look like it got Starbursts and Skittles
