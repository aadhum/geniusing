My bro's song, nigga
I got you, turn up
Ay, ay, ay, chee, chee chee!
All my dogs that turned pretty call them yorks, boy
If I'm ever in the hood, I got them narcs, boy
Hundred grand made on the porch, boy
f he has arms, I put some grams inside the leaf for him
I catch your bitch, control her like a leash on her
My whoadie got lots of keys like Alicia on him
I'ma shine bitch, call me Ol' Dirty Bastard
