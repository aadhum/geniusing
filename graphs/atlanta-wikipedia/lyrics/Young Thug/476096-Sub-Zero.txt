[Hook: Young Thug]
My neck and wrist on froze, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
Easter pink my Sprite, I think I’m icy
I put a 8 inside my 1, I call it priceless
5 hundred for my Js, shouts out to Fly Kix
These nigga thinks I work in there, only wear fly kicks
They call me "alphabets,” I keep that K around
Wanna know something 'bout Young Thug?
Ask your girl, she stay around
Got weed stacked up like mountains, we smoke that shit by ounces
[Hook: Young Thug]

[Hook: Young Thug]
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero

Now it's two door coupes, I came a long way from Marta
Put your head up for a bargain, nigga
Jewelry heat just like sun
[Hook: Young Thug]
My neck and my wrist on froze, Sub-Zero

My neck wrist is cold, Sub-Zero
My neck and wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, my neck and my wrist, Sub-Zero
Okay, this dope that I whip, Sub-Zero
