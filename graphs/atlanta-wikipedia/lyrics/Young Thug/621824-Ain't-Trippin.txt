My mind keep telling me no (telling me no)
My body keep saying I need it
Critics say I'm out of control (out of control)
Cause I'm abusing these drugs and I beat it
But my shoes tied so I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin (I ain't trippin ho)
I got lean and it's killing my kidneys
I got racks that I stack for my children
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, baby
My shoes tied so I ain't trippin, baby
I  [?] swear to god, Quan ain't trippin
I can't trip no more bae, I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin, I ain't trippin

Like it or not, brain shoot to the ceiling
So many clothes in the closet, she looks like dealer
Pour out 4 of that super clean (lean, lean)

Eating on shrimp, looking down at the shrimps
If you see me with a limp, don't mistake me for a pimp
The 40 get heavy when you tote it on your hip
