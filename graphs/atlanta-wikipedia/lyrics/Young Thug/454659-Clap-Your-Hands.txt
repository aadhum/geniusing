[Intro: Young Thug]
Thugga
I-I-I really love my F A N S
You know what I’m saying brodee?
I appreciate those people, you know what I’m saying bro?
They want a parade, yeah
I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
I just came straight from the bottom
Young Thugga came straight up from nothing
They know I came straight up from the floor just like a rug
I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
It’s a great blessing whenever I hit the stage
I used to do this shit for free, but now I’m getting paid
I won’t sell no yay, I won’t own saran
