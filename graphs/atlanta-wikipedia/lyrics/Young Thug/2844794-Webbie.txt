King slime aye
Lil mama overseas, I'ma Skype her
Do a dream with me, aye do some things with me
Bae drink your lean with me, bae fall asleep with me
Ayy fall asleep, we drive
Jeopardize your life or mines
Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that
Guess I'm geeked up
Like an astronaut, I'm off of Earth
I'm way in the moon, kickin' shit without a broom
Got a foreign car like a white beatle
Patek Phillipe they got my wrist and they don't play with that
Came out the hood, trap out the stove out that vacant
Now we flyin' different places, fuckin' bitches all different races
Thugger, he gave me a chance and I had to take it
These niggas actors like Patrick Swayze
Patek Phillipe
Cost a hundred bands, man
Clear nothing' on it
Then I went and seen Elliott
That's on Big Duck, that's on all 6, know I'm sayin'?
I got like a 170, 180 thousand dollar watch, bro
Til I started usin' 14% of my brain
