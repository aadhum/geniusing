I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's cause I'm the one
But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
If she don't like it she don't see it
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son, no Phoenix
And she never diss her old boy, no way
And I never told her nothing bout bae
Drank all her waist
Kuna Matata I need it,
I am a Mufasa genius
I know some Haitians and they cookin' babies, um, ay
I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's cause I'm the one
But I never told her that I wanna be with her
And I never told her that I wanna sleep with her
And I never told her that she gonna eat with me
Only thing I told the girl is she could bleed with me
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix
Started from the top then I fucked her little bottom
I'ma nut on her booty she a Prada
I'ma fuck that lil bitch and listen to 2Pac
Leave that bitch in a ditch and they wanna sue us
She's a barber, the bitch saying her crew cut
Put my dog in your poo butt
No stomach, came out the gutter
And she'll pull up on you, no baby
I won't move without my gun, yeah
And it's cause I'm the one
And she soft I call her Tempur-Pedic
And I can work magic like a genie
You can have my son no Phoenix
