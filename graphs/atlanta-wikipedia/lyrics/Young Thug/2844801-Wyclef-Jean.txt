This Actavis by the way I promise, on God
Okay, my money way longer than a Nascar race
I told her keep going on the gas, fuck the brakes
Only here for one night, let me put it on your face
Let a nigga nut, only way I'll go to sleep
Boolin, rockin' all the Frank Muller
I know some hoes with good head, fuck a tutor
So many hundreds how the hell I'm going to lose 'em
Put me in the Jaggy or the Wraith and now I'm coolin'
Play with my money, I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let them niggas do you
Play with my money I'ma let these niggas do you
Play with my money
Play with my, play with my money
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
Play around with my cash
End up in a body bag
Pull up, hoppin' out a cab
Her mama done walked in, but it's too big
She can't hide that motherfucker
Even if she divided the motherfucker
Man even if she minused the motherfucker
Join in get demolished motherfucker

Shop at Saks Fifth, flow on DatPiff

All my children spoiled yeah, they got it all
Daughter sexy and my son got the broads
Spent racks on my son and his squad
Daddy boy, never play with toys
Better not play with 'em boys
New AK with them boys
New feng shui with the boys
Drippin' all day for the boys

I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
I do lie, yeah, I do
