If you not from Haiti don't go there
If you not from Bleveland don't go there
Yes I still got boots, what size you wear?
And that jewlery super water, we got baths on us
When I pull from out of school we got staffs on us
We got math on us,
You know we up, I ain't talking bout no Folgers
She know how to get that dick back hard within a minute
She tell Young Thugger to put it up cause she got plenty
[Hook]
I'm gon keep racing to the top of the mountain
You know I miss him, that shit happen way too fast I wanna kiss him
Then sit back and watch the ambulance clean up you
