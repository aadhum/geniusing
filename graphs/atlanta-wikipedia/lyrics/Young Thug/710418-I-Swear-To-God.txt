Sneer attention, tangier foâ€™ this bitch
And I'm ready to spray, spray, spray, spray
I said I'm ready to spray it
On God I'll spray it
I swear to God I'll spray it
I swear to God, I swear to God, I swear to God, I swear to God
She look like Nicki Minaj
bick
She told me this shit straight up like a pole
Cookin' with no clothes
I'm drinkin' Actavis, I'm drinking Act
She want me to cover her face just like a wrap
Met her in 901
Unfunk
Catch
I don't wanna talk, I'm so ready to prove
And I'm ready for war and I hope you're ready for war
I hope she's ready to see spaghetti
I know that you're ready, I swear I hope that you're ready
I hope you're ready
quesadillas
game
Buy me a big old piece of weed
Pour a four, now I can't go to sleep
Thuggin' in these streets, if I'm lyin', I'm flyin'
