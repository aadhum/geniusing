In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
Livin' life like a movie cause I'm paid
And my whole brew shine like stars cause Iâ€™m paid
Carpet
He say he gone make it rain, I was like Tsunami
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
In the Phantom drinkin' Kool-aid cause I'm paid
