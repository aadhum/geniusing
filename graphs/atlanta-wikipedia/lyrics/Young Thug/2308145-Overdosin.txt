(Thugger Thugger)
I rock water like a fuckin' whale
Drug got expenses like a fuckin' bill
I like girls, I'm a fuckin' male
Nigga movin slower then a snail, watch me
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
The walls are closin', I'm overdosin'
I'm stackin' that money, I want it the oldest
Bitch I am a warrior, you know that it's in me
My son is suspended, can't ride in the Bentley
Four thousand on shoe strings, you know I ain't trippin'
I don't need a door to hand over them keys
Batter up, polo, saddle up, football tackle, hut
Pussy nigga, caterpillar, Stewart Little, hike
Get fresh, diamonds everywhere, styled by, my Ike
Paris Hilton, Master P Miller, big C member
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
I OD, ODB, dirty nose, coca√≠n'
Neck, ears, wrist, fingers, Aquafina
growin' green like a chia pet
Bought a condominium just to smoke in it til I vomit, and I'm so honest
London just walked in, I'm like "God damn" man "I miss my bro"
(London on the Track)
Your bitch just walked out with Young Thug, now you like, "Damn I miss my hoe" (Give her back)
I'm the type of nigga that nut on her back end
You the type of nigga that can't miss that hoe
You the type of nigga that kiss her in the mouth after she drank my olay, ohh
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
Overdosin', overdosin', overdosin', overdosin'
Overdosin',overdosin'
