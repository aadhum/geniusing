And I got stripes like a bengal
If a pussy nigga play he might just die by my baby
Shoulda never tried my baby
My diamonds are goin' dumb, SPED
I'm inside your mouth like gum
Experiment,
no wreck, I put dents on a bitch
I'll buy her mink, not trench, I'm a pimp
Big racks got me walkin' with a limp
Buyin' Rollies on Rollies like I'm Flavor Flavor's shrimp
Versace cover, roll that bitch up like some weed
I got more karats than a cavity
Baby don't pull it out of your teeth
We go shoppin' at Bal Harbour for the beach
Ain't talkin car but I need her to spoil me
Eli Manning, Peyton Manning throwin' dick in that hole
She told me that she love the way I dress, like a prince but I'm a boy
And like Wayne, baby it's all at the start
I throw some ones, baby catch it like the swine
I let that MAK-90 vibrate just like a beeper
