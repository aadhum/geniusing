I got a gun that'll kill an elephant
My little bitch flyer than a pelican
Jungle, jungle, I introduced that girl to my anaconda
You killin' all these strippers, Brian Nichols
I'm ready to make a dill, no pickle
Baby girl, I'll make you famous, you'll blow up, like a missile
Boom, boom
Hoes with no class, you know that's truancy
I'm going to jail for influencin'
You done shake your ass for all my ones
I got a stick that'll light up the room just like neon
Jungle, jungle, I introduced that girl to my anaconda
