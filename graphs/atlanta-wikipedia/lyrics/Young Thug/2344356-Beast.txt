Rollie pollie ollie, nigga
I found her phone and I didn't scroll through, nigga
I think they jumped on my pockets cause they swollen, nigga
Big B, Willy B,
still smoking gas, eyes low as a Chinese
I ain't talking guns, but I smoke the head of Khalif'
Call Thot-Keesha, she got the head of the week
This so bien, mamacita no Weezy
Plus he know I got stripes like Ocho Cinco
If I didn't know better I would've crossed out God and went voodoo
