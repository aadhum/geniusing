If that lil baby can cook I might just try my chef
I swear to God they rape me, I'll buy myself
No 80's I cook babies for my goddamn health
I flood you with them jewels
That fuck nigga think he cool, I'ma
And if she ever say yes I'ma dive in myself
Looking over my shoulder at all these ants like where they at?
Today I am with Jay-Z like Bey
I'll make it storm if
Ma control that pussy, come here pussy, come here
That Bentley got brown wood like a Spalding in here
Screaming "Flex" just like Flocka in here
I'ma boss, bitch I'm Sosa on like Chief Keef beats
