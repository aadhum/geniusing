Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
Run it up now I'm not average
I got three stripes like a fucking Simons
I'm screaming free Bloody, not Gucci not Dolph
No drankin' that Act' you niggas drink 'tussin
I leave out the club, I left that bitch flooded
Rain dance, rain dance, rain dance, rain dance
She want a lil' rain dance
Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
I'm a motherfucking stoner
Catch your bitch, you know Young Thug gon' bone her
Have you ever seen some VVS's
Have you ever felt like Houston Texas
