True story, you heard it here first
And by the time the summer hit you gotta know the verse
Biggie need that Jaguar, aka that fast car
Aka that Nascar, aka that drag car
My rap name is Young Thug
I'm taking the trade to be a Blood
My blunts are like two dubs
Put 'em out, the roaches like bugs
Kick this shit like new K, aka Lieutenant, ho
af
Got a pint of lean plus I'm on Patron
