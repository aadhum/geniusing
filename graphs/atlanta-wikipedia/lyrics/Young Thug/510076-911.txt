Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's
I’m in that 911, just don’t panic
I think my car need a band aid, I’m bleeding through the streets
I gave 'em mostly green like a salad, not average
No shirt with a scarf on my head like Sudan
Got a bank full of cash money, Baby and Wayne, dang
Nine-eleven
You know I’m gonn' kill them when I call that 911
You know I'ma smoke on that hash till there’s nothing left
You know I'ma cop them foreign cars till it’s none left
Thousand dollar step, I’m in that 911
Tearing out the streets in that new 911
Motors become a beast when you get 911's
Bitches turn their feets when you in 911's
911's, 911's
Nine-eleven
