I iced out my rings if I have on my shoes
I spent that house on my neck, I spent houses on necklace
I spent house on yo bitch then I let her suck on a lil neck, yeah
We gon ball like Spalding
But, if she call I might answer,
yeah, I like, I like dancers
Standin' out door smoking indo,
YSL we gon, till we D.I.E
I'm in Paris smokin' muh'fuckin' trees
Get up out my spot bitch
