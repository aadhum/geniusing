Chi-raq shoot like me in court
Hit me one time in my stomach
Purple leaking out my gut
Fuck your bitch I don't give a fuck
We get stoned till we throw up
I'm living life like the Jefferson's
Bible scriptures on my chest and shit
My pockets swole Nutty Professor it
If it came 'cross my table, we dealt with it
I need me at least 2 like I'm stepping it
I'm so bool that these bitches are acceptin' it
I got bitches that been known the bando
We so cool with the dope, we want molto
I know reds I know blues but no popo
I want ice in my teeth but no Coco
When I fuck her I perform the yoko
I pull up with gang members not solo
I got some big racks right on me

I got them big racks right on me, I got them big racks right on me
I got them big racks right on me, I got them big racks right on me
YSL Hercules, Hercules
I hide my dope and my coke in trees
Stickin' your bitch like a porky-p
I rock that white while she snort a G
Finger lickin' nigga, quarter key
Your money small I call it shorter G's
She up and down on it repeatedly
I fuck her hard, don’t accept apologies
Baby gurgle, color purple
Dick need nursing, gotta burp her
Top Shotta, kill my nigga
Closed curtains, no outbursting
We real killers not no crowd bursters
Psyche, bitch I'm shootin' every person
Catalyst, catch the wrist
Rabbit shit
fuck your mix
I’m the shit, she the shit
40,000 she’s a Birkin bitch
Looking, smelling, talking, walking bricks
Acapella still I walk the shit
Moonrock come from Cali, coughing, shit
R.I.P to Paul Walker, shit
I got some big racks right on me
I got some big racks right on me
I got some big racks right on me
I got some big racks right on me
I keep them big racks right on me
I got them big racks right on me
