She say she won't drink her some lean
Do you know lean make you do strange things
Girl you know I love to do strange things
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today
Now you flexing just like Lex Luger babe
My diamonds in the booth just shaking
Ain't got no time to starve cause all my homies done take it
And I'm so tired of hearing bout prison, I really hope I make it
Free UnFunk, free my nigga Haze
Know the streets begging for them
This world really gay, good leave young, free TayTay
Lets get it
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today
Hold a hundred grams inside my long johns
Brown Tru's today with these Air Force ones
I don't know your name, but I'll fuck your main dame
Hit her from the back, and chain swing
Soo-Crew, suwoop, it ain't nothing blue
I'm chopping my Reeses to pieces
Slow down, baby girl slow iiit down
No weed baby, roll it around
Earn you a brand new coupe today
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down, slow down
Baby girl slow it down
Baby girl slow it down
