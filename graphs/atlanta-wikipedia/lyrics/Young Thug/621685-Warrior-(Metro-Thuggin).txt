Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior
Motherfuckin' warrior
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
[Verse 1]
Pull up on bitches and ride 'em on top of the rentals
Thugger bend them bitches straight over just like a center
Fuck 'em with the F&N
She like to take molly, she pop a capsule with the Thug
If I fall in love like Danny Glover
I want to come from Uranus
I'm livin' my life mechanical,
she leave white stains on my jeans
I'm a red bull, I need wings
She let Metro get between
He bling, she fiend, she Billie no Jean
Pull up in a panorama
Young Thugger be a kind motherfucker
Hit you in the Maybach closed curtains
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior
Motherfuckin' warrior
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
My dick's what they holdin'
They need to let go, before it stretch like Fruit Roll-Ups
They're strippers I know this
And all they ass fat, they fuck up my focus
Baby I don't have time for no more
That's why I'm chillin' and things
I'm tryna maintain, my brain wanna go insane
Warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior, I'm a warrior, warrior
I'm a warrior, warrior
Motherfuckin' warrior
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me with the heater
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he please 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he tease 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
If a nigga think he better than me when he eat 'em
Man I sure wanna meet him
