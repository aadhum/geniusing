You're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly
Baby, you're pelican, fly, oh yeah, you're pelican, fly
Oh yeah you're pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Black diamonds dancin', I'm night today
No Falcon, but I see birds every Sunday
Magic city on a Monday, ayee
Throw a whole 50 on a bitch ass, ayee
Smoke a whole ounce of gas, ayee
Nigga drinkin' lean in E-class
Private flights, you gotta grind, you can't get it overnight
Lean, lean, mix the Sprite, the green or the red? I drink it straight
RIP to Pimp, C-C-C-C, I'mma drink you everyday
You're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly, you're pelican, fly
Baby, you're pelican, fly, oh yeah, you're pelican, fly
Oh yeah you're pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
That's a bad boy ridin' through the hood
Man I got a hood, I'm Trayvon good
My car got no hood, misunderstood
I nick-named your ho timber, she love the wood
No harmony, she gone bone cause she stoned
She pelican, fly, she pelican, fly, she pelican, fly
Yeah, she a pelican, fly, oh shit, she pelican, fly
Oh yeah she pelican, fly, oh god, oh god, oh god
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
Thugger, Thugger started whippin' packs, aye
