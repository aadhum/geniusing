[Hook: Young Thug]
I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
I know every lock on Slauson, but I don’t want no problems
They can’t see me with that wooly, they gon swear it’s a problem
[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Imma wrap my money it look like Oprah Winfrey
Ain’t no cypher, nor no wrestler, but a rapping invention
And I'm master selling them P’s, now my money no limit
I got my bed up, I shed up, don’t let up, no police, I’m fed up
I shoot at your head, your dreads, they dye us
You bitches just know it’s too hard to get by us
I’m not advertising but boy you can try us
Just get it this molly and stand right beside me
I’m with PeeWee Longway
You know every day a long day
[Hook: Young Thug]
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Take your boo then attend to her like a boo
crew
swoo
You not on my level, I done got my straddles up
Woke up with a nice, bad bitch inside my bed like fuck
[Hook: Young Thug]
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
