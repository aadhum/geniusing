Snake life, don't tread, left that bitch for dead
Pussy wet-wet, I'mma dive in like a pool
Cameltoe, cameltoe, baby girl bring me the cameltoe
We not the same I'm an animal, please put me where the piranhas go
Five thousand dollar for my shoes
I'm standing on couches, no manners though
We too turnt up
we drinking out the cantaloupe riding on banana boats
Jumped into bed with this bitch
and I put my fingers where the panties go
YSL YSL YSL YSL YSL YSL
Lord knows I ain't trying to go back to jail
