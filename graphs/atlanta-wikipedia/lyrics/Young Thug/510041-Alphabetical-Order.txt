They want to fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Ohh, lil mama got camel toe
Cartiers 25 hundred bucks
Right wrist Audemar, Brietling on the left
I’m a stoner child, aka Jeff
They want to fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
Guwop a real nigga,
I came from that clay
I’m surrounded by M&Ms, doctor Thugger Dre
Seven, seven, or eight, cooked up chickens
Powder, powder, powder
Put a grammy on the table and make that bitch snort it
And you know my dope as white as a towel
They want to fuck the Thugger
Alphabetical order
Make that ass clap like Magnolia
