Because I'm calling your name
Because I'm calling your name
Because I'm calling your name
Suck this dick, peppermint, hey baby
I feast on you, you nurse on me
I'm hungry, eat her like Denny's
I came to the town, discovered it, lost and found
She callin' me Jeffery
I protect her like a seatbelt
Nigga, money stacked up like 3 shelves
Plus I am a freak like 3 Kels'
Guns R Us, baby, Toys R Us
Baby I'm important like in Pedialyte
But nigga my water blue like a genie
Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us
I just drink that lean on me, I promise ain't goin' broke
When I hit the club, them strippers smile, I give 'em hope
I know how it feels to be so broke that you got jokes
Ali-ani-ani got me lookin' like the mayor
What you be, Thug? I'm a player
And what, Thug? I'm a slayer
And what, Thug? I make bail
And plus? I won't tell
You're a winner, in a Bimmer
And what? And I'm drinkin' 4 ounces in liter
Gots you wrapped, baby, Toys R Us
