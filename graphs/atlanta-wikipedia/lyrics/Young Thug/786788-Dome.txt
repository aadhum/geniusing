I got like 5 million and 12 hundred thousand hoes
They drippin' all over my motherfuckin' clothes
Let's go off the dome,
I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Dickie suit, chucks
Flag hanging to the right
Kid Cudi, fuck her all day and all night
Ok, I'm in this bitch with lil Duke, Longway
You can be with me, you too, four way

Addicting to winning, not losing
Fuck running off, fuck nigga I took it
Beyonc√© bitch I'm a bumble-B
This the B-hive, this my turf bitch, you can't sting on me
Let's go off the dome,
I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa

Let's go off the dome, I trap by the Dome
Keep a pocket rocket on me
Ain't no guessing if I'm gon' pop it
I hop out and cuss out my driver
Fuck nigga try me, no Eddie Bauer

I hop up like the Icy Tower (hop up)
I would rather be a coyote than be a coward
I'm running with armor
I'm not even thinking I'm right off the dome
Let's go off the dome,
I can't make it home
I fucked her, I boned her, she leave an aroma
They calling my phone up, my girl like "What's going on?"
She sucking, put me in a coma, I nut on that fish on my sofa
Yeeeeeah (yeah yeah yeah yeah)
