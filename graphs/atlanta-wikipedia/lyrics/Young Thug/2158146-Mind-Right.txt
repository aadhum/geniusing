I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya' digg?
Got my mind right and I swear I went ran up my money
I swear to God man I ride with that tommy I roll out the pound, not an onion
I ride with the semi, my money's no midget
Got ‘scale on my plane and it
came cross that water
Bitches they wan' know what's popping, they know that if I pop it they know that she droppin'
Come off the top like Eddie Hardy, and they know I bang red like a flower
I'm not a christian, I don't go to church, but my front pockets look like a Bible
Comin' up listenin' to my raps, I knew I needed one shot like a sniper
I might make it, Mayweather, just like TMT, ya' digg?
Go and get it just to say you did it
My brother deaf, but he moving pigeons
Ya' dig what I'mm saying, yeah freaky dig it
I really wanna meet her no damn ticket
I would love to feast her, I would love to eat her
I would love to treat her, I would love to trick her
This shit is serious, Brian Nichols
I'm on a Dom Pérignon mission
Leave a pussy nigga soul lifted
Ri-ribbit like a toad listening
