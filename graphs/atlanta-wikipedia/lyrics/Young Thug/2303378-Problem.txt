Yeah man, we're the private fly gang you know... join in bitch
Bitches in love with these slimers, how many now?
Lil nigga money long as a Greyhound
Smokin' that shit out the pound
We never lost it, it ain't nothin' to be found
These bitches come and go round and go round
I took the booty, nailed her like a mount
These bitches gon' cover me, I call them gowns
Gettin' extorted, then boy, that's your problem
No need for abortions, I'll nut on your momma
Send him up to God with no problem
Got icin' on icin' on boogers on boogers lil bitch that's my problem (Bling, Blaww)
Boy check out that Rollie it shine like a motherfuckin' Prada
In a Bentley burnin' loud and I'm gassin'
I got hundreds sittin' on hundreds, that blue cheese, I'm not ranchin'
I done took off on a boot now Iâ€™m Paris Hilton dancing'
And I feel like Marilyn Manson and I want a fucking Grammy
Pass me that mud, please just pass me that mud
Sticky white birds, call 'em doves
Implants up under my girls
Please no-no fallin' in love, no
I'm runnin' round with a bitch, mouth bout thick as a cup
Meanwhile they hatin', I done spent me some dubs
And I'ma lie to that ho like a rug
Shout out to Nelly Air Forces
Yeah, I'ma go ahead and free Offset, yeah he a Migo
(Free Offset nigga)
