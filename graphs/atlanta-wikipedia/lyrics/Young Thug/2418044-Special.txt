Thugger, Thugger, Thugger, baby. Mike Will in here, motherfuckin' Ear Drummers, you know what I'm sayin'? I appreciate the love at all times, I promise. Ya digg? Ya digg?
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger
Fuck her with a charlie horse
Pull up, let Lil' Dolly bust
Four fives in them Calicos
My cars sound like Need for Speed
My feet on some Mickey D's
These fuck niggas slower than rollie-pollies
YSL
Big B but Chanel on us
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger
Pull up in a Tesla
She on her knees like she want me to bless her
Balling on them like the Rucker
Keep that MC Hammer you can't touch us
I'm popping tags like they percs
Audemar
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
Check out my bitch, check out my peers, keep 'em extra
Keep 'em fresh, my diamonds a massive mess
She said she not going for that
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
My diamonds they got way bigger
I bought me a tiger, Tigger
I got a K and it's special just like its a cereal
I'm looking down on your peasants because I'm the king and I'm the superior
You know I got shooters on top of the roof and you think that I'm playing I'm serious
I'm on them Percocets and Vicodins
I'm adding the money not minusing
I got a bad bitch look like Kylie Jenner
It's a millionaire club and you not a member
Don't try me lil' nigga, I recommend it
Fifty thousand for the Audemar Piguet
You think about robbing nigga? Better abort the mission like you killing children
Cause I got that semi Grinch,
Coca Cola coming from Tijuana
Got that pump in my truck, I'm not talking about Donald
I want an island bitch, come here Rihanna
I got out of jail screaming, "Fuck the 'your honor'!"
I feel special, I feel special
Look at my wrist, fingers, ears, look at my neck glow
I feel special, I feel special
She keep her a Smith & Wesson
She keep it so confidential
She'll erase you with a pistol
