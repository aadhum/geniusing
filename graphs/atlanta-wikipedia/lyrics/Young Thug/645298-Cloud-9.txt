[Intro]
(Thugger, Thugger)
Chillin' at the top, cloud nine
Only cash, guap, I-I-I-I-I came a long way
(We got London on da Track)
I be chillin', I be chillin' all the way
Nigga winnin' all my diamonds black like Spades
I'mma hit it and then pass it to my bae
Nigga diamond water like a fuckin' lake
Aye, aye, ayeeee (ooh wee, ooh wee)
I-I-I came a long way (ooh wee, ooh wee)
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body
Chilling at the top, Cloud 9
Only cash, guap, beside mine
Feel kinda rocky, I got a molly I'mma take off with nobody
Won't tell nobody if you give me some of that body
Oooooh, let me touch all over yo' body
She'll pay you if I touch all over her body
I will kill if you touch all over her body
Touch all over yo' body, touch all over yo' body
