I fuck on your baby mama
I fuck on your baby mama
Let's fuck on your baby mama
Cause I wanna fuck on your baby mama
Some head from your baby mama
I need some brain from your baby mama
The head from your baby mama
I need me some brain from your baby mama
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
Lil mama she wet like a boat, a boat
Lil mama, she wet like a boat
I do it, I do it, I'm the goat I'm the motherfuckin' mule
I do it, the only thing I see is red like a bull
That purple label all up under my garments
You call me Osama I'm passin' hundreds to the bombs
I'm passin' hundreds to the bond nigga
You know thats nothin' but two crumbs nigga
I'm brand new just born, nigga
foreign
You know we chargin' like Dodge nigga
I won't hear you scream if you rich
I'm never gon' go out like Meech
A solid foundation the nation
Believe this shit started in the basement
My uncle that died is a Mason
We send them to a better place
We send them boys to meet their maker
I'm drinkin' syrup, nigga maple (lean)
Switchin' lanes in the Maybach (skrt)
