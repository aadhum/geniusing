Bout to take a nigga main ho to Hooters
I'm in the A tryna spend these Churros
I'm on three different drugs, this Cee Lo
But I can handle
So well I can hold a nine like Rondo
But I'ma wear a five like Flacco
Cause I bleed Blood
Diamonds hit like water, I think I got my sink on
Guwop, hey bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
Guwop, hey bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
I don't know what bitch to take
To my house cause I gotta lay
With a bitch that's so bad you know
Gucci Mane, I might pour a four
And a four, and a four, and another four
Four by four on 24's
We don't wear nothin' but Versace, we don't wanna wear Polo
Guwop, aye bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
Guwop, hey bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
Shooting star, shooting star, every car I got is a shooting car
I'm a boss so you can't recruit me nigga
Can't move me, salute me, or shoot me nigga
Your girlfriend said she wanna do me nigga
Hey now steady, hand's off me nigga
Might not have a chance to get a shot off nigga
I ain't talkin' bout no hospital but I see you
(That's what I do)
Guwop, hey bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
Guwop, hey bro
Told that ho that I'm a shootin' star just wish away
I done upped my features, ionno what to charge today
Ayyyyyy, ahyyyyyyy
