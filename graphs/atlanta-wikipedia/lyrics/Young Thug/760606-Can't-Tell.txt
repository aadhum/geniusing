Niggas say they fuck with you, I can't tell,
$500,000 Chevelle
I got bricks and birds for retail,
I got 100,000 worth of belts
These bitches and these niggas know that they can't play around here
I call the spot elementary cause I keep a K around here
All my Aces if you play they make you grady baby
I might shoot you in your head and then it's no more thinking
Pussy boy I'll leave you dead and call it dead-ication
I put Act inside my drink, they call it medication
Hold up, pull up, roll up, pour up, ounces in a soda
Push up on your bitch and shawty I didn't even know her
See this hood I throw up, realest one I ever seen
ATL, call it XXL, cause we stay spittin' shells outta long magazine
Real nigga got a crown, better own that thing
If the game got a throne, bet I'm on that thing
Beloved dope dealer and a well known King
You know how many suckers get ahead I've seen?
Bout the same amount of pussy niggas dead I've seen
You know how many bitches in the bed I've seen?
They like asking me how much bread I've seen
More than enough, in God we trust
Got your bitch riding everything but the bus
She let me put it everywhere but the butt

Make her give me nothing but ceiling (head)
2004 I was screaming everything Gucci, no Big Cat
Fuck a officer, Akon what it do bruh?
Might drop the top up off it
If I don't get into the helicopter
Feeling like I'm on a blue dolphin
Nigga ridin' round with like hella choppers
Every time I need new surgery I gon' call up my head doctor
Yeah, all my niggas they be bleedin' nigga
They ain't gon' never cheat a nigga
Pockets all swollen, no book
Since I'm on how the fuck do I look? (I'm on, I'm on)
