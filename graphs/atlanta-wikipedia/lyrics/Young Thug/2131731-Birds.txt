Brrrr bop bop bop bop you even if you got your hands up
My bitch screaming love peace and happiness no Canada
I'm in love with birds
I can whip a bird (Hey)
And I'm from A-Town and I need birds (Brrrrr)
(Yeah! Hey!)
Drinking purple, no prune
I'm drinking purple with no prune? (What?!)
Boosie,
Hey, tinted windows, you don't know its me
40 pornos cost me 40 G
Brrrr bop-bop-bop-bop you even if you got your hands up
I'm in love with birds
I can whip a bird (Hey)
Brrrr bop bop bop bop you even if you got your hands up
I'm in love with birds
I can whip a bird (Hey)
