I say bitch what is you thinkin', we Arthur Blankin'
Better stop listenin' to these hoes 'fore you start shrinkin'
I know ain't a bitch but I'm still singin'
I got the real hitters with me and they dangerous
You can't find 'em on no camera but they no namin'
Wash 'n powder bae I’m tired, I’ve been up all night
Me and bae Bonnie Clyde, everything we do right
She 100, the first day we met, she let me fuck all night
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight, baby, do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna)
If you want it, you gotta earn it
I can tell you a Victoria, baby, I can keep your secret
I'ma show you how to win without cheatin', I'ma show you how to beat it
demon
I'ma let you defeat me, I'ma lead you to victory
Like, shoutout to Stevie, but these niggas not seein' me
I'm a big dinosaur, B, and these niggas not beatin' me
Put 60,000 on my mama ring and it ain't even come out of Tiffany's
I can tell you how to get the money but you just gotta listen to me
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight, baby, do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna)
If you want it, you gotta earn it

[Hook]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, work
Do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight, baby, do the work, baby, do the work
Tonight I wanna chill so you gotta do the work (Rihanna)
If you want it, bae you gotta earn it
