The beat is produced by my nigga Wheezy
That's one of my newest engineers...
I mean, one of my newest producers
I'm high, sorry
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen
Come through, won't you see me with my lenses
I got falcons in the Honda Civic, I'ma get it
I got dolphins in the fuckin' fender and they bending
Then she gon' start suckin' like ticks
And she wanted my milk like a W.I.C
Ice is drippin' like a faucet
I am hotter than a Taki
Woah, woah no Kemosabe
I got Ms like talkin' Miley
Lil mama my money stretch like elastic
No rubber, I might just use plastic
I'm a real boss, I'ma fuck her and leave her in dirt
Like a muh'fuckin' Maverick
And I got lucky, I'm lucky muh'fucka
I might just go play for the Celtics
Buy my Burberry at Dillard's
Boy you know that you not realer, a thriller
Boy you know that you're not built like that
Hit you with 3 like Reggie Miller
When I dress myself I'm the topic, yeah the trend
Unlike a needle I don't never wanna see the pen
