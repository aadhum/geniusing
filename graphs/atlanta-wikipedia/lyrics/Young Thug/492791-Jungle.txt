You been hustling for ten years, which means you bad at it
If a million was nine feet, you wouldn't grab at it
But a cracker got five thousand, you would snag at it
I be in the crowd with my fans, I have a groupie heart
Them niggas wifing them, we be on the next hoes
But I've been fucking beats, that's how I got two babies
Cleveland Ave is a concrete jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
Niggas from the ave don't fumble
They can't fumble (Yeah)
They won't fumble
Cleveland Ave is a concrete jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
It's a jungle (It is)
Niggas from the ave don't fumble
They can't fumble (Yeah)
They won't fumble
What's the beefing about? And niggas say they shooting?
Yeah! Shouts out to the ROC crew
You like a new pair of shoes, I gotta cop you
Shouts out to all 11 of the kids
