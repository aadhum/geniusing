Yeah, I got you boo
Together forever, man any problem you got, bitch I got it too
Wheezy beats
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on (different time zones)
I was tryna get the devil out of my charms
I was thankin' God, I was thankin' Allah I'm on
Hop out the Bent and into the coupe
My dresser full of diamonds
I pour my own juice
Just in case a nigga look on me, and try run up on me
I'ma fuck with the cougars
Elliantte gon' flood me, man fuck it I'm stuntin' on you
They told me that I was gon' end up like MC Hammer
Cause everything I get, I try to invest it in you
In the daytime a nigga havin' nightmares
I wonder if he answerin' every one of my prayers
Hate to say it but I go broke 'bout anyone of my peers
You ain't gon' never change this shit
Yea, I'm bustin' down, yeah
Every single mothafucker 'round me rich, we just gon' bust down, bust down
Yea, I'ma hit the clutch 'bout you (skrt)
Can't nobody ever beat the triple cross
I got snake in my veins, snake in my drawls
I got snake on my attire
I was out the country, ain't know what time I'm on
And I just wanna make it back to my kiddies
And I just wanna sit back and count these digits
I know my niggas go monkey like Bathing Ape
I was just holdin' you down and you didn't stay down like you 'posed to
Together forever, man
Any problem that you got, bitch, I got it too
