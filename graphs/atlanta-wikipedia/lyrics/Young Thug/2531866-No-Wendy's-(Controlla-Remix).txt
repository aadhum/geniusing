Girl I miss the old you, like the oldies
I'll introduce you to all my kinfolk
I'll stay inside you I won't go out the door
She don't really bark,
I was followin' her like the whole day
Shovel shit,
This that shovel shit
This that shovel shit
This shit come straight up out my kidney
I just bought a Wraith fuck a hemi
Make her call me Mr. Williams, no Wendy
All my niggas eatin', no Wendy's
Yeah, no Wendy's
Usher let it burn, baby wait your fuckin' turn
I met you bae
I met you bae
I'm on Cleveland like I'm Kyrie Irving
Same place I caught my first STD
I came from the bottom, you believe me?
And I made it to the top, now you can't see me
I got ice on like I'm Johnny, on your TV
And I'm Clyde and she Bonnie till we dying
Make her call me Mr. Williams, no Wendy
