Heard these niggas sneak dissing
I don't know how I'ma go about it
Cause she think I like a bitch that used to show her body
Rollie pollie ollie nigga
I got 3 strikes and I ain't bowling nigga, psh
I been poppin' lots of shit when I was rich
The same shit poppin' with a quarter nigga
Pockets are all swollen nigga
I want that face like a emoji nigga
I'm the same nigga boolin' on the block
Like it's never been a cop
Like my ring ain't worth a solar system
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties
Fuck a lake, I got fish here
Kill him, tell his momma get well
I'ma pull off watch me fishtail (skurrrrt!)
Spelling YSL
Where my lean at, I need potion
I never gave them swag, they stole it
I transform like I'm in Otis
Let's play a game, bankrolls on us
Fresh kids, there are never same clothes on us
We the slimes, big snakes, can't poison us
All my ex bitches might get embarrassed today
I'm high as all flight attendants today
Milk carton your bitch is missing today
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties
This nigga talking about this
And this nigga talking about that
And I don't know who to believe
To be honest I don't care
Just keep that lying shit over there
I don't want that germ on my team
One bitch sucking on my dick
Another bitch eating her from the back
Tell me who wanna join the scene?
I said who wants to join the scene?
Come with me to paradise
I'll be your king you are my wife
I've never been in love oh my
I need you to complete these ties
