Boy you know you could’ve had a winner
out
parlay
For meeting your match and ain’t gon' be no match is just me on your ass
Two or three in your back now you’re bleeding all over your homie damn pants
Let go the MAC and your homie done ran
No disrespect know lil homie the man
Respect for whoever lil homie demand
These pussy niggas fake and they twice as green as turf
