Pussy niggas actin' like they never had shit
All these bitches actin' like they never had shit
I got a bad bitch, she said she always had shit
All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
Catch that nigga slippin', I'ma do 'em nasty
Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
And we can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic
The kushy that I smoke'll blow your lungs out
I'ma walk in and clutch it like it's a war house
All your bitches thats busted, they live in your house
What goes up comes down, my nigga, north south
I done ran up them M's without a tour now
She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now
I swear to God they're pursuin' at all my shows now
Ayy, hopped out my 'vette and hopped right in a foreign
Ayy, suck that dick good, I'm the mothafuckin' warden
Ayy, she runnin' away from my weed like it farted
She don't wanna swallow so I put it on her neck
I beat that pussy up, she loud as a parade
I cook fishscale
and sang to her same time like Tank
I was born in '91, 23 years old with a whole lotta stain
(5 star mothafucka)
All my diamonds need to be drained
And all my dogs, they're dirty, check for mange
Who said you was straight? Boy you need to be retained
All these bitches actin' like they never had shit
All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
Catch that nigga slippin', I'ma do 'em nasty
Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
And we can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic
The kushy that I smoke'll blow your lungs out
I'ma walk in and clutch it like it's a war house
All your bitches thats busted, they live in your house
What goes up comes down, my nigga, north south
I done ran up them M's without a tour now
She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now
Took the Rollie off, put the Breitling back on
Walk in the room and I cut the lights on
Why you spendin' like that? Cause I ain't never had shit
YSL shit
Never loved a bitch but I love money
In the church payin' my tithes with drug money...thank you
Went and got a new plug,
Couple bitches, good weed that how a nigga chill
Top floor, penthouse, still crackin' seals
Them Houston niggas be like, "That young nigga trill"
Them New York niggas say that young nigga ill...down
My mama always told me dress to kill
Hey, my uncle always told me pack the steel
All these bitches actin' like they never had shit
All these flawless diamonds, yeah they're lookin' glassy
Catch that nigga slippin', I'ma do 'em nasty
Check out my attire, this expensive fabric
And we can wrestle just like Randy Savage
My jewelry as cold as an attic
The kushy that I smoke'll blow your lungs out
I'ma walk in and clutch it like it's a war house
All your bitches thats busted, they live in your house
What goes up comes down, my nigga, north south
I done ran up them M's without a tour now
She done stepped up her game, Christian couture now
