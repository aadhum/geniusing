Been through hell, but I'm God's gift like Kooly, Kooly
Shout out to Skooly, Skooly
Like Shaq feet, y'all been gay
was never
She like how the hell you put 50,000 in these skinnies?
And when I hit it, I'mma get inside her kidney
I drink that lean all day, I don't have no limit
And just like Master P, change the Alley boy image
These niggas singing on they partner without a Grammy award
I'm in that 2015 fish with the sign like a fork
Yeah, and then that Masi
And I'm swagged the fuck out, I don't need a stylist
She like how the hell you put 50,000 in these skinnies?
