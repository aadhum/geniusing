I got a half bird in my M2
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
36
For a brick, too legit to quit
Michael Vick, all my dogs yeah they with the shit
Catch a point, shake him up like a hit stick
Your bitch is... on my dogs like a fucking tick
Straight up out that bowl with my fucking wrist
I ain't 3hunna, but I'm Sosa bitch
My patna got the plug, he serve him everyday
Real ice inside my wrist, you can just skate away
Don't play because them sticks sound like these 808s
I got a half bird in my M2
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
Spit more fire than a matchbox
Full cup of that Actavis
Walk in the club, iced out
Neck and wrist, lighthouse
I got a half bird in my M2
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
I got a half bird in my M2
Got shiny shoes, got shiny jewels
Ain't nothing blue, they red clues
