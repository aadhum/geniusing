Rich Gang (birdman sound)
I won't live it up until I leave
You canâ€™t sweep my flyness like no witch
Wassup Nipsey, I got keys to the city
I'll love my bitch and tell me I know feelings
boy you not runnin
Tummy no stomachs
My racks are lettuce, my kush are onions (Oh no no)(woo)
I'm gone always say yes to my bitch never no no
I think that her pussy is tight cuz she pigeon-toed
I know all my diamonds are water because they soaked
Bitch I 'm high off substance
I'm a bee plus I am buzzin'
Wassup Nipsey, I got keys to the city
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
All I wanna do is see Gladys
So I sure a nigga get stacks
Pretty Benz with the tinted rims
Big money nigga 100 stacks (big racks)
Bad bitches in them new backs
Guns up nigga fuck friends (click click)
A 100 niggas in a 100 Benzs
Wassup Nipsey, I got keys to the city
