Pull up in the Bentley (skrt)
Hop out with your missy
I'm blowing her kisses
She blow on my dickie
She douche it with tissue
I can go slow like a I'm old
I can go fast like a fiddle
Hop in the Bentley, 20 inches in up under me
stingray, no bumble bee
I'mma spend racks on the red bottoms for all the people under me
My jewelry wet, baby, bring me some napkins
I don't like cameras but feel my action

Pull up in the hearse, your head I'mma burst
I slow down your trap, Young Thugga the curse
I'm serving the patients, get head from the nurse
I pull up with Gators and we take your water
Like a dolphin
I'm in Memphis with Boo Dirty nigga ten-a-key
