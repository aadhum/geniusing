I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' nigga... I'm sayin')
Nigga I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' my nigga..I'm sayin')
I was 15 years old when I shot that chopper (rrraah rrrah rraaow!)
I bought a carbine 15 when I was 18 (And what?)
Sent a couple niggas to the doctor (yooo!) (bah bah bah!)
I rape it, I finger that 'xtendo (Woo!)
I peel it, I feel it
My gators look like they got Syphillis
I'm not Casino, but Thugger be killin' it
Killin' it, killin' it (Killin' it, killin' it killin' it!)

Nigga I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' my nigga..I'm sayin')
Piped up and shot an Olympia
OG, we wrappin' and shippin' it
Who told you lil' niggas i ain't with the shits?
Pull up and hop out with dirty sticks
We comin' for nothin' but 36
Them birdies for all of you idiots
How could you lil' niggas be soldiers?
I go down yo' roster ain't none of you killin' shit
Jawbreaker, jawbreaker, jawbreaker
I got that hard like "Ed, Edd, n' Eddy"
I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' nigga... I'm sayin')
Nigga I'm just sayin' homie (sayin' my nigga..I'm sayin')
