Not a toy, baby girl, I got a little boy
I could get chickens
neck is
Choppers gon' chop and I swear to God I am a slime I'ma shoot at your spin
Watches on watches got timing on timing I just might bring Flav Flava in
Cookies, I roll it, I roll it, got fish scale but I don't got baits
These little bitches know that I'm the future plus I'm holdin' weight
If you ain't sayin' that nice, my nigga, what the fuck you mean?
Got a lot of niggas on the block that'll do or die for this shit
Bitch I'm on fire I fire the best fire like a Bic
My bitch she rich and black like Oprah Winfrey
I just want to feed you this candy like a Mamba
