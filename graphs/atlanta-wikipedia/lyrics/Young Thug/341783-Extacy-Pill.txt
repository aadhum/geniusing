Ecstasy pill, Miley Cyrus
Automatic, big as a wheel
4-door 'Rari
Nigga play with sticks in them chicks
I paint her face just like fuckin' mascara
I come through yo' block and make a fuckin' mess
In big white minivan with choppers and TECs
I just be like "uh" like her name Alexis
I be leanin' like a Texas
Her mama muggin' cause I fucked all her folk
I'ma put a hundred bands in her pants like "I wish a nigga would"
God damn, that head like a golden spoon, just for my pudding
You know I'll buy that bitch a new whoadie
I got a fo' of Act' inside my styrofoam, who wanna lean?
This nat nat know I'm not big Rocko
But you know I got nachos, nachos, nachos!
Ecstasy pill, Miley Cyrus
Automatic, big as a wheel
4-door 'Rari
Nigga play with sticks in them chicks
I paint her face just like fuckin' mascara
