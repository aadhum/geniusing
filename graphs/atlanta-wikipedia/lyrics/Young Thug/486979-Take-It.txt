Where you at blood they going take it
Pull up on you with the shit I ain't waving
Charge nigga wit a sack just to erase em
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
YSL slim bones creeking like the dean
Yo old ladie is hot, she hot, she hot like the fuckin 9/11
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
If I fall for her I spend bands on her wardrobe
Let that chopper sing to em like Pandora
