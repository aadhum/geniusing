[Intro]
L-O-V-E
For life
And I got me a high self esteem
Big old digits with me
Big old Bentley with me
Big old bitches with me
S gang chino with me with me
I got 3 stripes, Adidas with me, with me
Big racks and that Aether with me, with me (racks)
This bitch Master P cause she 'bout it, 'bout it
Iâ€™m sitting at the top of the nose bleeds
And I got my gold off of Goldie
you have to hold me, wait for home
Have you ever been a shot caller? (Have you ever?)
Proceed to the room, leave em stalkin'
And I got a high self esteem
That's on me, that's on me
That's on me, that's on me
Turn up for the club
percy
I put on my mink I'm like a lamb
Stop trying to impress your fuckin' cams
I'm comin' for mine, Uncle Sam
I'm turnin' money into power
We not from here we need a browser
I'm studyin' like a bookworm
I'm tryna count at least a hundred bands (racks)
And I wanna just buy some bigger land, yeah
And I got a high self esteem
