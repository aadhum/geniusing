I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AB bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
I just bought my bitch some new titties
I’m flexing, got muscle like Popeye
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AP bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
I just bought my bitch some new titties
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
They got lots of bread, I’ma call Butta
She say she want a cat
So I went bought the Jag
I just dyed my hair grey
Like a motherfucking dad
Mind fuck ‘em when I speak
Take the Farrakhan notes
I’ma take out the trojans put it right in her throat
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
AP bitch, I’m all bout them Benji’s
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
I just bought my bitch some new titties
Nigga jewelry water, need to float it
I know that I’m making a killing
My coupe got them stars in the ceiling
My niggas go brazy, no Ritalin
My wrist a haircut, I’m not kidding
I just bought my bitch some new titties
