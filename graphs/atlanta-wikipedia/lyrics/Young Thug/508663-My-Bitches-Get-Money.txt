My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I’ll serve you like waiters, I’m high like a scraper
I’m cashing out for 100 P’s (sheesh)
Put em straight in the trap and then it collect the green
I got young niggas standing on the block
I told him chill but he refused to stop selling rocks
My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I’ll serve you like waiters, I’m high like a scraper
These niggas ain’t got no money to dress like I dress
These niggas don’t show out and be oh so fresh
I got that stupid bread, my mama don’t got to want for shit
1017 brick squad, bitch I own that shit
I got a 10'O clock appointment at the office, trick
And pour a half a pint of lean in that coffee bitch
My bitches be running, they chasing that paper
I’ll serve you like waiters, I’m high like a scraper
