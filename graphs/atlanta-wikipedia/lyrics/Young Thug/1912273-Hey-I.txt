She let me wet her whole lil' ceiling
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I wanna bang like a pistol
I'm banging red like soo woo, ooh
Brand new rollie I'm living sporty
She still the bomb, call her lotus
Hey, racks keep me up with that Folger's
I'm up, I'm up
I might hit 'em with them bucks just in case he got luck
This a Crime Mob lifestyle nigga knuck if you buck
Just cause I'm in New York with a puck
Don't mean you won't get stuck up, up
Ay, I might just tell these hoes my secret
First I like them red like a demon
My dick like crack so yeah I'm dealing
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I, put something in your stomach next to your kidney
Fuck all them other hoes talking, they Wendy Williams
Now your wrist got ice like December
I pour out the paint like Mutumbo
I'mma fucking lion like Simba
And, yeah my girl ballin' like Kendra
She gotta love him, Peter Griffin
Nut on the front of her head like I'm Eddie Griffin
I make it count, I'm a star and she can make a wish
I'm going down with her hard till I'm addicted
