Pull up to the block and then wet it up
Pull up to your property, wet it up
These bitches see this ice, they get wetted up
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
You know just where we at on the regular
I was just was chilling today
I was just relaxing today
I just made a bitty bitty k
I was just chilling today
Spent my last 50 bands on a watch
Ho I can make you look like an amateur tonight
I can fuck a bitch on a bus like she Rosa Parks
Nigga’s diamonds soaking wet, yours dark
Fuck her bad like I’m tryna catch a charge
Fuck her fast like I’m tryna catch a charge
Yeah, play with me I'm Brian Nichols
I’ma shoot a motherfucker, yeah y'all
That nigga need a bird, call Tyrone
Yeah, I’ma fuck your bitch while you all gone
Yeah you all gone, but the dog home
She gon’ get what she wants, temper tantrum
Pull up to the block and then wet it up
Pull up to your property, wet it up
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
You know just where we at on the regular
Put a case on that pussy ‘cause I’ma smash it
If I eat it she gotta be a Kardashian
Any rapper in the city I don’t play with
Any time I pull up in broad day shit
Now she want to fuck me now, I got a waitlist
Put this 40 in his face, rearrange shit
Pussy bumbaclot, you know we not scared of you
You know just where we at on the regular
