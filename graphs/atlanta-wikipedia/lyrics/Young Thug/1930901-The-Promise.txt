I'm sitting up high, I'm in the nose bleed
I got extendo under my extendo tee
I swear to God Iâ€™m Herby Curby working
I'ma block it out just by counting these knots
I'm just kidding, I think not
I'ma hold this weight down even though it's a lot
And I got extendo, look like I got two rods
Jacob
Kyvion
Haiti
Yes I heard you're the king of the rock
But when I hit it like a hit stick I make it shock,
Help me find love, help me find love Stevie I can't see
I'm a snake, you know my tail sting, plus I'm a Bee
no Mama Dee, but
I'm spitting so hard I might just lose my teeth
Tree top, she a lil leaf
