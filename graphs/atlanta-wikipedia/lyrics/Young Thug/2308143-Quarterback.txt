Ninth grade
Listen nigga
Yeah
Gah
Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High
When you in the trap, all these rules apply
Keep it in your lap, not to the side
End up successful, all your cars glide
Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya
Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her
Top rope, I might John Cena (scene her)
Momma duck eating good, like she ‘posed to
Spent a dub on my teeth and my golds too
Spent a sixty on the bracelet call it old news
Spent a dime on the red carpet oh, oh
So many black chains on, look like a goatee
Your bitch gon’ suck me, look like she don’t got no teeth
Bring a Molly, yeah I’ll see
I’m smoking pot while you smoke weed
Just cause I’m signed, don’t mean treat me
What's brackin
Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High
When you in the trap, all these rules apply
Keep it in your lap, not to the side
Been so successful, all your cars glide
Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya
Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her
Top rope, I might John Cena
Fifty bands on your head, my niggas take the charge
All of my niggas one thousand, they get it
Your niggas, you flexing, and fraudulent
Two bitches with me they ménaging
Shoutout Skippa tha Flippa, came up from nickles
Green diamonds like a dill pickle
Drinking and pouring a double seal
And taking trips across the country just for money
Take the pot and slam dunk it, Tim Duncan
Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High
When you in the trap, all these rules apply
Keep it in your lap, not to the side
Been so successful, all your cars glide
Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya
Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her
Top rope, I might John Cena
Feeling myself but no masturbation
I’m 22, rich with no education
The world’s gonna end one day, read it in Revelations
Good brain she deserve a scholarship
The pistol like lighters, you know that I pocket it
And know my diamonds came in from Africa
Smoking on Salvia that came from El Salvador
Got on my Cartier eating on caviar
Double down FN shooting out missiles
Two bitches with me nigga, call me Malcolm in the middle
Ninth grade, quarterback, Washington High
When you in the trap, all these rules apply
Keep it in your lap, not to the side
Been so successful, all your cars glide
Breathe easy, bitch I might just teach ya
Not a pleaser, I might Mickey Ds her
Top rope, I might John Cena
Ninth grade I was serving quarterpound
Make them move it like John Cena
Pull up and drop my top off like Houdini
Longway and Thugger Jonesboro South demeanour
Smoking OG Moon Rocks mixed with the Diesel
Givenchy walking on the stars
Pull up in a fuckin’ Bentley truck
