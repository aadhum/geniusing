Please tell 'em they wanna be me
Somebody tell 'em they won't be me
Tell lil mama she wanna be me
I pulled up through, they wanna be
I tried to tell them they won't be me, nigga
I tell them they won't be me
(Tell them, tell them nigga)
City know, city know they can't be me (the whole city)
City know, city know they can't be me
Know they can't...
I could be servin' to be precise
Oh, she cook the Thugger corn and rice
I might pour a lot of pints, a lot of Sprite, a lot of ice
Two cups stuffed, I need two cups stuffed
Clean a bitch face with the nut, fuck a Puff
I'm a savage, I'mma fuck her like a savage
She love my thing and then she following all my steps
Then she chase a nigga down like a rabbit
Watches is just change, yeah my ice from Johnny Dang
You can feel my pain, and I dont need no T-Pain
You got so much pain that you don't need no T-Pain
I can't find the place, I'm pouring your children down the sink
My Maison's on her like a carriage
I'mma show her love and she gon fuck me like a king
I'mma fuck her friend that says she fucked me in her dream
I'mma make her nut and yes I want that nut on me
I'mma fuck them both and yes, they want that nut on we
record,
I'mma catch your bitches, yes she fucking on my team
I'mma catch your mama, she gon' fuck me and my team
I'mma catch them both and they gone
