Boy, I stand behind my bars like a convict
Nigga, what I’m about to drop is timeless
Like a nigga who just lost his Timex,
I’m on a star track, welcome to the enterprise
‘Cause I'mma kill it with a dagger and a diamond boo
So tell Professor Plum and other rappers they done
Alfred Hitchcock
I’m about to go psycho
while y’all keep playing, Tyco
Top ten, double XL don’t make typos
We bear arms like a grizzly
believe it or not Mr. Ripley
