In Mrs. Williams' chorus class I was sangin' tenor
Tryna figure how a nigga get his paper up
I sold Blow-Pops, Moon Pies, and Kool-Aid Cups
To the newest 3 6 song
"Slob On My Knob"
See were grown then
So now we act like kids
Hell, I pray so much about it I need some knee pads
Andre 3000 of the legendary Outkast
But, some nights I come home to high to pray
But I get on my back anyway, and meditate
Khujo Goodie of the legendary Goodie Mob
