Notorious for rolling B-I-G
my hustle grand
You ain’t see me out with T-I-P?
You minimal, I max nigga, 3D
vintage whip, ‘63, six plus three sitting up under the seat
She six times three sitting next to me
Yeah I’m about to take that
these wheels cost me a fortune, Sajak
but I take some head
If she in the red like Piru
Out sipping Pellegrino with my Filipino
gold chain tucked in, not they’re here to debo
