The education they give us seem to be minimal
Dont waste your time on them niggas they gon be criminals
And then (beep beep) there go my nigga E beeper
Interrupt my dream, Interrupted class
Teacher confiscated damn thats my nigga ass
And not because of school
Its because rent is due by 2
And his momma got laid off so he trying to pull through
do my teacher understand?
Naw.. cause she ain't never had it like that
9 year old me wants to be rapstar
25 year old me wants to run away far
"if I could get one hit, i'd stay far away from satan."
Till then ill be smoking and drinking
Porno-watching, five-finger discount shopping
My future daughter and son who have just begun to be thought about
But they ain't comin' til this rap working out
