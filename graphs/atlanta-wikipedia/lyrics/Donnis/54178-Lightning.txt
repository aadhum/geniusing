Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
Don’t look back ‘cause we’re all like lightning
Here today, then we’re gone like lightning
Light up the sky and live for something
Everyone lives, only few become lightning
We here on a mission and it starts in the mirror, Lord, can you hear my prayer?
