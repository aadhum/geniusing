Country boy, Country raised so we Country cool
I go hard ‘cause I’m playing for the high score
Roadrunner trying to run it like an athlete
I’m the bomb bitch, ACME
then got on track with a track
Cudi called back and it sent him through the roof
That was enough proof to show me I could do it too
So Cudi’s On The Moon and Drake’s So Far Gone
I’m Finally Famous like my boy Big Sean
That I ain’t even seen so I'mma tie this bowtie and I'mma iron my jeans
Like a god damn option,
Won’t let you spend one twelve
if you boxed the son
