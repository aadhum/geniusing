I think it’s time that you move on, somebody tell these niggas that it’s over
So pack it up and then move on, this time around, it’s only getting colder
You had your run, you had your run and now you’re done
You think that everybody know your name, boy, this ain’t Cheers
We’ll take your little spot, this here is musical chairs when the music stop
We back to the block so we don’t care about your chain or that little car you got
Failure’s not an option, it’s more a promise for these other niggas
Spitting them candy bars, niggas’ minds is on Mars
Playing Raiden on Mortal Kombat ain’t even as shocking as this
