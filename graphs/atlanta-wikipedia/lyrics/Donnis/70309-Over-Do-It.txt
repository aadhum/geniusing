They don't wanna give it to me, okay fine, I take it
My mama told me that this life is only what you make it
So I don't wanna flow no more, I'mma overflow
And do the type of shit that get her front row at the Oprah show
Talking about how she raised a legend, not John though
Just a Don though would flow like lava and I protect this shit
Like it's my twelve year old daughter cause these niggas is predators
Donnis bring fire like cavemen, thank him
Blackout and I wish that my life would end
Sick of dreaming of this shit, nigga I wanted in
Imaginary friends, imaginary ends, imaginary Benz, I imagined it
job
effort
