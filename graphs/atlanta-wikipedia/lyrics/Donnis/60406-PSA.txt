[Intro]
Phil Connors: I'm a god
Rita: You're God?
Phil: I'm a god, I'm not thee God. I don't think
Phil: Because you survived a car wreck?
Waitress: You folks ready to order?
Phil: I didn't just survive a wreck, I wasn't just blown up yesterday. I had been stabbed, shot, poisoned, frozen, hung, electrocuted and burned
Rita: Oh really?
Phil: Every morning, I wake up without a scratch on me, without a dent in the fender. I am an immortal
They can’t get over my bars, they like an obstacle
I give ‘em to you in bulk, you know how Costco do
Shit, I came from Uncle Sam’s club
I know about landmines and why I am blowing up
Because these niggas keep stepping
And it ain’t in the name of love, see they'll be
Shooting at the clouds if they know your dreams above average
And you in the pursuit of happiness
They don’t want you to be Big Willie
Singing "welcome to Miami" down at Wet Willies
Haters need some TLC, uh, uh, no Chilli
And I applaud him, phenomenal as I hide behind this tip like a Navajo
