He was always such a nice boy
The quiet one
Cause smart don't make you cool, whoa
With his Father's 9 and a broken fuse
Since he walked through that classroom door
He's all over primetime news
She put her fingers in the imprints
At Manns Chinese Theater Show
She couldâ€™ve been a movie star
Never got the chance to go that far
Her life was stole
Now we'll never know
He's not invisible anymore
With his baggy pants and his legs in chains
Greg was always getting net from 20 feet away (20 feet away)
He had a try out with the Sixers
Couldn't wait for Saturday (Saturday)
Now we're never gonna see him slam
Flying high as Kobe can
His life was stole (Stole)
Oh now we'll never know
