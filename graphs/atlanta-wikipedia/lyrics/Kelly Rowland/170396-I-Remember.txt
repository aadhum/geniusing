Remember when I was your baby
I was always sneaking in your mind
I remember
Oh, oh, when you loved me
They say you know, yeah you know when it's over
It hurts when it's over
Remember when you used to lay your head on my shoulder
It made us feel closer
You messed up my head
No never (never) no, no never
No never, again
When you told me you loved me you was game for that
Now you too good for that
I remember
You would always check up on your baby
