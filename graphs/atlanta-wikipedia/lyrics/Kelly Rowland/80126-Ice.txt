You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
Scorching me, you're so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Baby your love is so hot hot hot hot hot hot hot hot
Take the ice cube (boy you know what)
Sit it right below my navel
You're like ice
I-C-E, feels so nice
The mirrors, the mirrors
Up on the ceiling, got things so visual, so visual
He comes again my body going numb
Hot as ice
Uh, ice, ice baby
Shake that ass just like dice baby
I beat the cat, animal cruelty
Sweet tooth roll tussy
If you are what you eat, I'm so pussy
we do it til we both exhausted
Twin pipes,
Would you like anything
Cause i'll do anything you like
she want a made nigga
Watch me clean up,
I leave that pussy smoking
Smoking like ice
