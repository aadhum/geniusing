The beautiful Miss Kelly Rowland
Looking at you, baby, you got me
Inspired to be a motivational speaker..
Baby, I love the way we act so civil with eachother
We can giggle with eachother, we can nibble on each other
Go me feeling like you really dipping me in butter
Closing every door and I be closing every shutter
Loving every single thing about us now
Especially how you want me to come and meet ya mother
Baby please, make no mistake
Every single little thing about you great
lay you down and quickly taste your cream filling
And when were done, I don’t wanna feel my legs
And when were done, I just wanna feel your hands all over me baby
You can’t stop there, music still playin’ in the background
And you’re almost there
You can do it, I believe in you baby
So close from here

When I start to go under
Now your turn, go low with it
Got you out untied like
You make me work harder
When you say my name
It’s not over, til I make you rain oh
Leave traces of your kiss all over me baby
see I got mind control
When Kelly Rowl’ come around I be quiet
When she leave I be talking again
Yeah, niceeee!
I got no more patience
Slow rotation
Keep it clapping for me girl, more ovation
Got me doing shit, girl that body dangerous
Motivational speaker thats uses body language
And I read it well, them other boys ain't literate
I follow what you sayin’, you ain't got to
