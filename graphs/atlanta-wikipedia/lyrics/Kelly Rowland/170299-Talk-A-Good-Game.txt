You talk a good game
I really want to believe you
(Oh oh)
But I got questions in my head like
Is it true
What to do)
I don't want to see myself
(Play the fool, baby ooh)
Uh uh! No way!
I prefer you keep it real with me
Cause I-I
Don't think I can take
Another broken promise
Why do things the hard way
When you can just be honest
If you get to acting up
I cut you off like that
pool
