I really hate to see that look on your face
You're lookin' like someone came and rained on your parade
I can say "I'm done" in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush, let's cut to the chase
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And now I'm so through, too cool, oh yeah
And if our love was a game, you just lost
And you changed, I changed, but it's too late
And if you think I'll waste my tears, boy you're crazy
And maybe you should get yourself admitted, don't delay
Now you on a plane, you've got a crew
Boy, what'd you expect for me to do?
You claim you wanna have a life or two
But you can save your "sorry's" and your "I love you" too
