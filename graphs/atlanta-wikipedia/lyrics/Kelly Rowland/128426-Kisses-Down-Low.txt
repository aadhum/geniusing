You put in overtime
You hold me close, please me tight, look me deep inside my eyes
But nothing can compare to when you kiss me there
And I can't lie when I lie in your arms baby I feel so sexy
So gorgeous just take your time, send chills down my spine
that’s why I got to make you mine
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me
Slow
Baby just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby just like that
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
Baby get a little rough that's okay
ride away
Boy, if someone could see the way you kiss on me
Oh they won't believe it, cause even I don't believe it
but I love the way I’m feeling
[Pre-Chorus]
So gorgeous
send chills down my spine
that’s why I got to make you mine
I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby just like that
She like her kisses down low
Make her arch her back
When you give it to her slow
Baby just like that
A little more to the left
So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
Makes me arch my back
When you give it to me slow
Baby just like that
