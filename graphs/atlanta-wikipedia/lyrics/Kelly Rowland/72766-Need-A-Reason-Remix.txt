We did it in the benz feel it like it would never end
We breakin' all rules, these rules were meant to bend
Hands on my body like oooo, all day
Yea I need another fix you the drug boy
I'll put on a little show show show
Look at your star
I can't believe I haven't sent a couple kisses to your navel, baby lately
Slow down a little bit I'm right there
Yes its right there, stay right there
