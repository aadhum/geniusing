They say true love, is enough
Forever, forever
Then I'll stay here in your arms
Forever, forever
Not a thing in this world I won't give up
They say I got it all, but they don't know that all is you, is you
Can't see myself, with no one else
No never, no never
I can make it through, the worst with you
So whatever, so whatever
