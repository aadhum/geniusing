Last night we made a movie, and tonight will be the sequel
Send a pic, let a nigga get a preview
Come and suit it up, on my GQ
And I'ma make you take it off with your teeth too
Nasty, tonight we skinny dipping, no pool girl
Except the one between your legs, I'm a fool girl
Put your skirt on, turn you to my school girl
Smack you with my ruler girl, you know how I do it girl
The king of the California kings
Watch me lay it down and I ain't even tired
Putting work in and I ain't even hired
Hitting high notes, neighbours thought you joined a choir
She drop it then wind with it
Turn my lab into a chaffeur and I'll spend all day just riding it
Just a red light special but I swear there ain't no stopping this
said shawty bring it back
Call my dick "Curiousity" cause it killed the cat
And satisfaction brought it back
Girl it's your world, I'm just chilling on the map sayin'
