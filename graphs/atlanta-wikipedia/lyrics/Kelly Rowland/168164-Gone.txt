Hey love - thought that I'd just share my day
It felt a little bit crazy, baby
I cleared the closet so I'm out of your way
I guess you can have your space
Well, I thought that I should write a letter
And I thought this would be better, don't yell
There's a million ways that I could tell you
But I think I'd rather show you it's over
And I won't be back no more
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Don't it always seem to go
That you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone
Gave you my heart, it slipped through your fingers
Oh love - your dinner's waiting down the street
And you can have it your way
So the mess you made is yours to clean
So don't be looking at me
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Where you going? What you doing?
Oh, you must be at the point
Where you can't take this no more
So you grabbing your stuff, walking out the door
Moving so fast, forgot what we was even arguing for
