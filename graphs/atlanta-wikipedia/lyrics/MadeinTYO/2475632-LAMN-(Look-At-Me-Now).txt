I want a brand new whip
I think that these niggas would too
When you making money and you acting so new
I ain’t really fly, I just copped some Bape shoes
I don’t really like lies I don’t watch the fucking news
How you got a girl but she fucking me tonight?
Can’t fuck with the lames, you ain’t even living right
My team say, fuck 12
I’m just smoking J's tonight
Feeling like the young nigga Dynamite
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain’t even want me
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain’t even want me
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
East side shawty got a check
