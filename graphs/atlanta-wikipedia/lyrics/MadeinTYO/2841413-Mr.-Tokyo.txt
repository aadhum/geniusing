Oh, K Swisha
She say Mr. Tokyo, do your thing
I don't need it baby girl, do your thing
Iced out hockey diamond ring
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
My shawty bad, you seen it
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
Give me the beat I eat
This my first time baby, but ain't new to things
Give me the beat I eat
Give me the beat I eat
