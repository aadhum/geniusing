I won't let the fame change me
You know I'm on the road now
I miss you in every state girl
I can't let go now
[Hook]
But I won't let the fame change me
Man, I won't sell my soul now
But I won't let the fame change me
Baby I can't sell my soul now
I'm thinking 'bout signin'
I want my shit to go Diamond
Baby I know my shit fire
your shit fire
When I get back home, I wanna eat it like pie
Baby put it on a plate
It's been 5 months baby, you ain't even been on no dates
And she tuggin' on my zipper
Phone ringin' fuck it, we don't even pick up
Missed calls in the morning, room service hear the moanin'
[Bridge]
Breakfast in bed, blunts on me, know I've been fed
Foreign my head, Backwoods my weed
Know its OG, you know that my plug fuckin' with me
[Hook x2]
I'll never let the fame change me
I'll never fucking sell my soul now
[Bridge]
