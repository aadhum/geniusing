I want a foreign lil bitch
She put it all in her mouth (Skr Skr)
I wanna turn up the loft
I want strawberries with Voss
I want a Gucci hat
I wonder why these niggas rap
I want it so I'ma get it (Skr Skr)
I want it so I'ma get it (Skr Skr)
I want it so I'ma get it (Skr Skr)
I want it so I"ma get it (Skr Skr)
I wanna rock that Rick Owens
I wanna ball out at Phipps
I be turnt up in VIP
TPC know what it is
She working that wrist til her arm hurt
Never slackin nigga, all work
My ex want me back I won't call her
