I want a brand new whip (skr skr)
I want a brand new house
I want a foreign lil bitch
She put it all in her mouth (skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it (skr skr)
I want it so I'ma go get it

[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
I wanna turn up the loft
I want strawberries with Voss
I wonder why these niggas rap
I want my frames from the 80's
I wanna rock that Rick Owens
I wanna ball out at Fifths
TPC know what it is
She working that wrist til her arm hurt
[Hook: MadeinTYO]
wheels
My car it came with umbrella
I throw some rain right at you
I throw Supreme right at you
I throw Lil Wayne right at you
Ice storm, might go 100 thousand dollars on the right arm
Cause I need some brand new mouth
Step on a brand new couch
I woke up in a punani
We woke up in a Bugatti
[Hook: MadeinTYO]
wheels
