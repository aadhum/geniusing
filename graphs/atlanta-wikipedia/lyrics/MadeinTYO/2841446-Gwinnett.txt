Lil Souf, yeah (what)
I used to stay on north side, that's Gwinett
She only hit me up when she want sex
I left that bitch and got right to a check
I drop these bands and watered up my neck
Oh, yah, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right, had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, hit that bitch with all my might
Got my bread right, moved up out the 8
I feel like Kobe ballin' in LA
I feel like Kobe ballin' in LA
I used to stay on north side, that's Gwinett
She only hit me up when she want sex
I left that bitch and got right to a check
I drop these bands and watered up my neck
Oh, yah, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right, had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, hit that bitch with all my might
I used to have 5 bitches on the roster
Louie loafers, copped 'em, yeah just to warm 'em up
Deadstock ones, ugh, they ain't been touched
Remember when a young nigga didn't have much
I used to stay on north side, that's Gwinett
She only hit me up when she want sex
I left that bitch and got right to a check
I drop these bands and watered up my neck
Oh, yah, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right, had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Yeah, north side, yeah
