Where did you go?
I've been running around the world
Gotta let you know
I got the empire state now I'm working on the next part
Trying to build an empire, I'm wishing on the Death Star
I murdered the dish, I eloped with the spoon
Tri-coastal and the third coast is the moon
I can't promise I won't be dressed like a viking
When I do the whole picking you up on my bike thing
Another white rapper's CD in my spokes
I would swear ya'll converted to rap for the jokes
I spit black smoke
I'm the hip hop pope
They make anti-me PSA's cuz I'm dope
And when it's not clear you can cope, the worlds a negative iPod
You just hear 'nope'
On some Liz Lemon movin' back to Cleveland
Street lights people, up and down the boulevard
Don't stop believin in your journey, and I know it's hard
They call me Violet Beauregard, cuz I just blow up, no regard
A balcony, a star crossed lover to yell up to
[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
I shine like the sun
My mouth is a gun, pop off and they run,
two things like a pun
This is not just for fun and I cut with my tongue
My mouth's a Swiss army, take over your country
I run like a humvee, I don't need gas-o-line
I run on these rappers so skip the stromboli
'Great' like Tony
So how the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me?
How the fuck you gonna say these bitches don't know me
When you all on the tip of my dick like Moby
The wait is over, no baking soda
I saw them dudes move bricks and boulders
I saw them dudes move flats and corners
And they moved that sugar like Russell Stover
I got that green like a four leaf clover
Get rich or die tryin' like my name two quarters
we got the same hustle till the tank on empty
And if you dope boy, better watch the Wire
You either move weight, play ball or neither
Because I'm neither, the hood Macgyver
The boy blew up like he knew Al Quaeda
My life so sweet that my balls Godiva
The world in front and the hood behind us
The hood behind us
Yea
The hood behind us
