So Profound
[Hook: Fam]
Niggas, niggas talkin' 'bout licks [x6]
Whole clique is in zone six, oh shit
Ape shit flow so King Kong nigga
You got big money, man? how long nigga?
My Polo rounds, fuck her for only a photo now
Wanna be me but they don't know how
I'm my favorite song
I came to ball
And aim at y'all, you know the semi-automatic with no safety on
Ass backwards, Kriss Kross
T-Rex, Chris Bosh
Nigga we eating so Rick Ross
Brown rice
fish sauce
Fly as a kite, man I must be
My niggas is making it dusty
Cause I'm aiming at you like I just sneezed (like I just sneezed)
They're my niggas
