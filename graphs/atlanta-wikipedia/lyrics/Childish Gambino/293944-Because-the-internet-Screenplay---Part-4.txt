This is Part 4 of the script, read Parts 1-3 if you have not already
[VISUAL PLAYING "DEATH BY NUMBERS"]
*******[PLAY SONG "FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
The Boy wakes up. He's in a gown. His eyes feel heavy.
"Golden Girls"
Sitcom laughs always freaked him out. Because most of those people are dead. Those are ghost laughs. Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying "don't go there".
Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone.
The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs. Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore. They've been reappropriated. Now they're just sounds monkey descendants make when amused to cue other monkey descendants when to make the sounds at home
...my eyes feel heavy
WHITE GUY NURSE: Hello Mr.[EDIT]. How are you feeling?
       THE BOY: Like I'm about to get talked to by someone about- (gestures) All this
Silence. The Nurse begins to clean up
WHITE GUY NURSE: You done?
       THE BOY: I was trying to be
       WHITE GUY NURSE: No you weren't. Cause, guess what? It's not hard to do
THE BOY: I don't wanna talk. Let's just go be awkward and quiet together at Chipotle. Alright?
["WHAT?" EMOJI]
SWANK (CONT'D): Man...your pops died, man. Got the call
THE BOY: Okay
(hum of a jet engine...)
*******[PLAY SONG "ZEALOTS OF STOCKHOLM" AT THIS POINT]*******
Stockholm
When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories
The Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day. Even if he was just ashes. So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden
Some girl named "Hello_Pity_" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do.
Her profile bio said she was half french.
She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty. But that really doesn't mean anything at all,
especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all
She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was "fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol".
This girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber.
The "fuck you" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like "my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!"
I'm sorry for your loss
He gives The Boy a large brown paper bag

bar called box
Weird
[CRYING LAUGH EMOJI]
wdym
[CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI]
There's a buzz going on. Very pretty people walk hand in hand on the street. There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
SUPER HANDSOME GUY
SUPER PRETTY GIRL:
She gives him a kiss on both cheeks
I don't know what you mean
ALYSSA: Let's go
       THE BOY: Didn't you want me to meet your boyfriend?
       ALYSSA: Who? That guy?

She points to a corner of the building, a few steps from the front. A guy with long blonde hair (her boyfriend?)is making out with a girl in the cold
Nothing. You're getting into nothing
small talk
THE BOY: She does private web shows. We're not together. But it's a relationship, for sure
       ALYSSA: I don't get it
       THE BOY: I used to watch her online a while back. Then she quit and started doing private shows. Then it just started turning into talking. Mostly
       ALYSSA: Wooooaah
       THE BOY: Wha?
       ALYSSA: You're paying her to be your girlfriend or friend or whatever
Yes. But most people are paying for friends one way or another
The two are sitting on the bed
urn
THE BOY: No

Silence
*******[PLAY SONG "URN" AT THIS POINT]*******
Yes. That gives you the right
ALYSSA: Brain cancer. It was bad
THE BOY (CONT'D, whisper): I'm sorry we're alone
He pours out the ashes. He's gone
BOYFRIEND: Do you know who the fuck I am?
BOYFRIEND (CONT'D, scream): WHAT DOES THE FOX SAY! (silence) I. Wrote. That. That's my shit. I'm the nigga dressed like a fox. That's all me
"were the internet"
BOYFRIEND: Uh, by "when it was popular" do you mean, uhhh, RIGHT THE FUCK NOW?!
BOYFRIEND: Two hundred and twenty million views on Youtube. Two hundred and twenty million. That's most of the earth
       THE BOY: Not true
and told me that my song taught them about foxes. They don't have foxes there. I introduced the idea of a fox to an entire continent...
The Boy walks away. Alyssa and her boyfriend start a boring argument in the cold as he disappears
CUT TO:
INT. LA VEGAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT
NAOMI:
NAOMI: You're the guy that almost hit my arm
       THE BOY: Yes
THE BOY: I hate vegan
       NAOMI (saying it dumb): Duhh, "I hate vegan"
In his head, he was lol-ing. In real life, he just kinda looked down
NAOMI (CONT'D): What's the deal. Why you always act like your parents died

The Boy smirks

       THE BOY: They did
Awkward.
I'm so sorry
Fam and The Boy stare at each other for a moment. Then laugh. Another Girl and Naomi do not
FAM (to The Boy): Your parents are dead, man
       THE BOY: My parents are dead yo

They slowly stop laughing. Naomi thinks The Boy is weird. But she doesn't run
Fam and Another Girl are sitting on the swings smoking and talking about something they will never remember and don't really care about
NAOMI: What did he do?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: How'd he afford all this?
       THE BOY: I don't know
       NAOMI: Then how can you afford all this? He leave you a lot?
THE BOY: Creditors were after him. I don't know if he had anything left. I'm not concerned. (serious) I'm gonna sell drugs
And I know I'm good cause people keep stealing my shit

She hits the vape

       NAOMI (CONT'D): I tweeted this. (holds up her phone) Is that not my poem verbatim? I posted them together. This nigga just rapped this like it was his
THE BOY (looking at her phone): Your first mistake is being a poet past the year 1974, by the way
No. I'm talkative when I'm high. I'm cocky all the time, but I'm silent for most of it...like you
NAOMI: I read something that said more than likely we all just do this all again. It's all a cycle
       THE BOY: I like that theory
smiles
