“Where's the ground? Where’s the earth? Where's mom?”
And now we're headed somewhere. Moment to moment. But we don’t know where and we can’t stop living.
The Internet, our new earth, moves forward only leaving behind a curated record
Because the Internet was made to be the soundtrack to this new coding. The reworking of our humanity.
Trying to find [each other/ourselves] again after the big bang.
The rules of the Internet are the rules of our new universal language
Pushing forward until we are all just a bodiless conscious, buzzing through the air trading information, conversing, testing ideas without fear or violence.
Free from limit.
This is the moment we decide if we want to be the kid pouring salt on a worker’s head at the sit in, or the kids sitting calmly in the face of what everyone else identifies as futility
Or we can be the kid sitting back, just trying to eat. Ignoring what’s happening in front of them. Not having an opinion until the acceptable choice is handed to you by people you don’t know
be[a]ware
Our human collective unconscious

Our deep web
