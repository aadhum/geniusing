Childish Gambino, yes my voice is annoying
So I don't talk, let the streets talk for me
Yeah these girls crazy, half got children
I hate their ex-boyfriends, call 'em Scott Pilgrim
I'm fucking girls I really shouldn't be fuckin' with
But if we get caught we just hand it off to our publicists
Plus I hang with some of their ex boyfriends
What can I say? I make bad choices
Culdesac dropped, day one, five figures
Fish fry nigga, fry mine bigger
Still unsigned, fans sayin', "What's the hold out?
When every show you've ever done's been sold out."
I always wondered what this hollywood would do to me
Who's that rappin', yo it's Troy from Community
Fuck that man, dude you lyin’ like a Mu-fuck
Besides, the beat's real good, but the lyrics sucks
Well I made the beat too, yeah, soak it in
I'm a phenom nigga, where the fuck you been?
People say I should be more humble
I hope they understand, they don't listen when you mumble
It only takes a lie to make a dynasty crumble
That why I catch feelings and these other dudes fumble
I'm not playing, this music's something I care about
I take this shit to the streets, watch me air it out
Get the check, deposit the shit at Maxfield
Feelin' my self, I don't even need an ex-pill
I wish he'd do a funny rap, like SNL did
If I don't take myself serious, who the fuck else will?
And to the critics with reviews that were more than sour
Is it strange having jobs I can do tomorrow
You bitches don't like shit, and it's kinda sad
I like food, sex, clothes, watching Breaking Bad
I’m something that these cool kids never really had
That's why these nerdy kids come find me on the internet
I wanna be different, I wanna do it good
Not another actor turn rapper in movies bout the hood
Niggas say they want the real, but get mad when they hear the truth
Please forgive them, father, they're knowing not what they do
make this music so these younger dudes don't have to choose
Trying to hate me means you really hate you
Life goes fast and I'm holding on tight
I let things go when I'm holding this mic
And it's six in the morn, I've been writing all night
If I keep on going, I'm hoping I might be
Untouchable ... untouchable ... untouchable
My dad called sayin', "Son are you okay?
I just listened to ‘
The Last’
your mixtape
Dad I'm fine, you just need to understand
When I'm rappin on a track, that's exactly who I am
And all my smart friends sayin, "I really liked your album dude"
"But you could be the next Mos Def if you wanted to"
Dear friends, I respect your responses
But my life is a dream, so I rap unconscious
I'm sorry guys, I hope I didn't let you down
I rap what I know and hope the fans will work it out
Not conceited but sick of trying to lay low
No drugs, I'm just trying to tell 'ye "yo.”
Online dudes shouting out that they better than me
I'm doin' three other jobs,
bitch you better be
Cause if you're trying really hard, that's embarrassing
I won't stop until I'm fucking running everything
The more I rap the more I'm harder to follow
I get a text from Questlove, I gotta call ‘em tomorrow
I'm coming harder than other dudes, so it's harder to swallow
That I'm blowin’ up. Thirteen Mission: Apollo
Fuck niggas who doubted me eat your words, it's a feast
I used to hear nah's all the time like Kelis
Fuck the old Donald Glover, Yeah I'm glad he's deceased
Cause that sad weak being been replaced with a beast
