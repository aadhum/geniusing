You'll be my unregistered, sex offender.
When my mom and dad are both at work
I can lie about who ripped my shirt.
You're my middle-aged angel sent from above
You're required to go door to door and tell them we're in love
We could be close together when you're far from your wife
I think that scars are really cool. You should scar me for life
If we do something dirty, I can just take a bath
Age is just a number, and I'm not good at math
Let's take it slow at first; I wanna remember it all
Because I'm gonna show them where you touched me on a doll
[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
I know you think about me, when you're at work
Lets take a walk to your car and start an amber alert
I know you're friends with my dad, so you're closer to me
Lets do tonight, and I'll repress the memories
I know how to keep a secret well
Wanna bring your love to show and tell
