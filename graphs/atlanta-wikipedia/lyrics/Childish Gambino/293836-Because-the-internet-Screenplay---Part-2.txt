[VISUAL]

The Boy lies, arms to his side, on his bed, looking at the ceiling

Spiders slowly drop from single strands of web from all the posts on the bed. It looks pretty. All of them dropping simultaneously swaying together. They whisper:
......where are you?
................who is this?
...don't slide
It's almost a song
*******[PLAY SONG "THE WORST GUYS" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
More people are at the house. People drinking and smoking. Shoes off. It's a Temple. Respect it
The back wall of the living room has been pushed into the wall, so there's a seamless transiting from living room to backyard patio
AJ is djing in the middle of the living room
The projector room (theatre) is playing Fight/Vine compilations
THE BOY: Don't sit on that
They look at him. He stares back. They get down. He walks away. They stare as he leaves.
The Boy walks to the edge of the pool and looks at the ocean go into the sky
Please tell me you saw that Argentinan...Argentinian? Argentina-girl. I can't say it-
Stop inviting random niggas in here. If you don't know their names they can't come
It's like I came in a Prince video
I like, blacked out. Couldn't breath in there, mane.
You're the Florida of my friends
INT. FATHER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The Boy walks up to the door. Before he can open it, Sasha opens it from the inside. She's with another girl. It feels like they just did a drug or were stealing something themselves
UUUUUGGGGHHHHHHH. SOOOOO SOOOOOFFFFTTT
SASHA (CONT'D): Show us your dick
THE BOY: Wha?
THE BOY (CONT'D): Why?
Cause it's probably gross and I wanna laugh at it
OTHER GIRL (agreeing): Grape dick
No
The Boy plays with his dick. Nothing. It's like gum
[ASHAMED EMOJI]
He walks into the bathroom and closes the door. Locked. Silence. Sasha sits on the floor
What's up?
*******[PLAY SONG "SHADOWS" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
The Boy sits on the floor. Head in hands

Damn, guy
VANESSA: What are you doing?

       THE BOY (head in hands): Chillin

       VANESSA: In the Bathroom?

       THE BOY: Mmm-hmm

       VANESSA: Well, I want to go out

       THE BOY ("no"): Mmm-mmm

Vanessa playfully throws things from the counter at him (toothbrush, cup, floss, soap). He throws some of it back. She starts laughing. He pulls her to the ground with him

       VANESSA: Why are you so moody?

       THE BOY: I'm not. Let me enjoy this for a second
We can do this outside, [EDIT]
We could live the rest of our lives here. There's a TV in the mirror. There's fresh water every time we flush. I heard they're building a sandwich place in the shower
She opens up the linen closet and pulls The Boy in

Coachella is inside the closet
There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose today. It's a great time
VANESSA (CONT'D): We have to see everything together. I don't wanna split up this time. We each get to choose one band the other one can't make you see- (then)
VANESSA: No, I don't think me and you together is a waste of time. That's what you think. And I'm tired of trying to convince you otherwise. At least be a man and break up with me instead of telling me I don't like you
scroll
"I'm almost Vashtie" bullshit
[NO MOUTH EMOJI]
VANESSA (teary whisper): You're so mean
VANESSA: Mean doesn't mean honest! Honest can mean mean. But only if you mean it

       THE BOY (so many "means"): Wait...the-
I'm trying so hard with you. But I'm not gonna carry us. I won't waste your time anymore
Then she looks to the sky and shoots up like a rocket
They never see each other again
WOLF 1: What'd you think of 2 Chainz' set?
WOLF WITH GLASSES: Have you heard that Roc Marciano album on vinyl? It's so good, man
MESSY, BUT COOL WOLF: You guys, this is my fiance, another wolf. He or she works in a small music or graphic design for niche clothing or this app I'm building
They rip The Boy to shreds while they talk. Blood everywhere. The Boy doesn't make a sound. Lets it happen
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
There's also a note written in lipstick on the mirror that says "YOUR FUCKED" (smh at the "your"). Probably Sasha. She's probably right
The house isn't totalled, just dirty.
Empty cups, bottles, cigarette butts, etc.
Oakland
SWANK: Wha? (then) How'd we get poor?
*******[PLAY SONG "TELEGRAPH AVE." AT THIS POINT]*******
Swank, Steve, and Fam are asleep in the car. The Boy sits down in the driver's seat
He pulls out his phone and texts someone named NYALA:
DONT
The Boy looks at this. Then starts up the car and turns on the radio and speeds out of the driveway
THAT GIRL FAM KNOWS FROM THAT ONE PLACE: Fam?
Lloyd's "Oakland" is playing on the radio. The Boy turns it up so he feels like he's in a video.
He slammed Swanks knees. Sorry
The Boy speeds through the empty highway.
I'm not sure what those factories are in the middle of nowhere with all the lights on them. They're probably horrible for the earth, but they look really magical at night. He passes one of those factories
Smells and looks grey and awful.
All the cows look really sad. Maybe I'm just making them sad. Maybe they're fine
There's a billboard. It says: ROSCOE'S WETSUIT

The Boy stares at it. Just a white billboard with "roscoe's wetsuit" on it
EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE IN-N-OUT - DAY
As The Boy bites into his double-double he thinks about the slaughterhouse. Then he looks at his burger. He laughs
One of the women is wearing a Northwestern hoodie

       SWANK (re: hoodie): Long way from Chicago
WOMAN 1: Alumni

       SWANK: There's no way. You can't be over twenty-three
Johnny Appleseed of confidence, man. Just leaving little seeds with everyone
They run inside. We see people running in their cars, and driving off. All of our guys stay seated on their car. Just eating
ROBBERY DUDE 1: MOVE, RYAN!

       AJ: This nigga's using his real name. Treated
"Snake-Man"
MARCUS (in anchorman voice): Two men were arrested in an attempted robbery at an In-N-Out burger today. (mumbling) Also some niggers ended up dead, we don't know. This is news, people!
"White people still safe!"
Fuck
There's a point you reach when you're no longer able to feel like you did. Not about a person, not with a certain place, you just can't feel like you did because that muscle or whatever is just...dead. Or gone
I don't know you. We're not together. I have company. Go home
THE BOY: Okay, you're being mean now

       NYLA: "Mean?" Who cares? You're an adult. Also, you embarrassed me
We were planning on having a kid together. She offered and we had a whole plan. Like adults or something. Then I backed out. So...
The guy goes -__- [SIDE EYE EMOJI]
This is really sad for both of em. They really wanna know. Nyla closes the door
Please grow up
Then tries to cut off a fart with his hand as he walks to the car
*******[PLAY SONG "SWEATPANTS" AT THIS POINT]*******
INT. OAKLAND CLUB - NIGHT

The guys sit at a table in the corner. The Boy is sitting in the corner. Fam is texting. Swank and Steve are talking to two girls. A promoter walks over
Promoter gives him a [NO MOUTH EMOJI].
People are staring, like "is Diddy here? OMG Diddy's here!"
There's a stack of cash sitting in the middle of the table
The promoter stands there
INT. DINER - LATE NIGHT
The guys are eating

       SWANK: But animals eat animals, man. Animals!

       STEVE: The argument is that we've been given the freewill and understanding of life. So we shouldn't because the option is there for us

       SWANK: Man, in Nigeria they made me AND my little brother slaughter a goat. We raised that goat, man. I loved that fucking goat. And one day we came home from school and they just handed us the knife. I've seen the blood man. I've heard the screams. I still ate the shit though
...I was here before
THE BOY: We were here before

       FAM: What?

       THE BOY: We've done this before

       FAM: Nah man. This is our first time together in Oakland
THE BOY: This is every night. This is all the nights, man

       FAM (weirded out): Nahhhh. We switch it up, man
But behind her, there's a guy in a colorful faux 90's hat
"roscoe's wetsuit"
HAT KID: Oh. I don't know
THE BOY: So you just write shit you see?
The Boy SLAMS his fist on the table. It's loud.
Everyone in the diner looks at him. The Boy doesn't look up
THE BOY (quiet): Tell me what it is or I'll cut you open and take the answer
Silence

CUT TO:
[OPEN MOUTH EMOJI]
Boy doesn't say anything
There's an Indian wedding happening. They're probably not called Indian weddings
It's probably just a wedding
Nah. He don't get any interracial points. He's just doing what white guys been doing since forever. Exactly what he wants
you're
team light skin
A wedding
Yeah. (then) Marriage is so wack. I mean, I get it. But come on, yo. Forever
("Ms. Jackson") Forever, ever? Forever, ever?
Mane, I bet both of em are like that
FAM: Cause they reached their goal. In a year they'll
Be like "oh fuck...goals are dumb."

       MARCUS: Goals are dumb?

       FAM: Making your life a goal is dumb. I think. This shit is supposed to be just fun.
STEVE (yelling to Marcus): Gee-van-chi!

       MARCUS (calling back): Nigga, god bless you
They Kanye shrug,
INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT
THE BOY (sincere): Beautiful
It was time.
THE BOY: Yeah. I keep in touch with all my exes. We're all friends

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: You still call them

       THE BOY: I send em a happy birthday text or DM 'em

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: That's not a friend. I do that with my boss. And I hate my boss. (to himself) Fuckin Korean kid thinks he know everything
The man just stares, not understanding

       THE BOY (CONT'D): How old are you?

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Fifty-three

       THE BOY: I'm like Bill O'Reilly

       OLDER INDIAN DUDE: Oh
Greg smokes weed. You gotta deal!
Everyone claps
*******[PLAY SONG "3005" AT THIS POINT]*******
Little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say "HAPPY MARRIAGE!". Some have sparklers. They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment. Then it feels wrong

All the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans.  But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals

All the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic)
Their eyes are larger than they should be
They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies.
They all have forced smiles on their faces.
CREATURE 1: We did it!

       CREATURE 2: Yay!
[LEMONGRAB: UNNACCEPTABLE!]
This is the end of Part 2, continue on at Part 3
