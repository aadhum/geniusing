Rosenberg
Fam
East side Atlanta where they kill niggas
I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side
Radio play me that new "3005"
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Man I'm so fly like XYZ
Threat to the throne, man I'ma murder this
Bino well read, like Octobers
Stone Mountain bitch, run it off a mixtape
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Man.... I thought he was an actor
Thought he was a fuckin' joke, when I wrote them fuckin' notes
Everything I do is dope, I hope you niggas overdose
Royalty, I run the crew... we dem boys
Schoolin' these niggas, got so many zeros they think I'm a dummy
man I'm really from Atlanta
Niggas need to learn code, man I'm sick with the Python
I know they hate a nigga down in Spin Mag
Worst album, best song, how you spin that?
The best part is that they love Chance
But our fans are the same, you should fuck with your man
And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop
"His verse was wack, his verse was hot"
I'm on my jock cause I don't need these hoes
They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair
Like "bitch do I look like I care?"
I watched these niggas switch jerseys when your team lost
Then you fly to Kauai for a week off
And his girl's body lookin' like a centaur
with my hand to God
So my hand's on my fuckin' chest
