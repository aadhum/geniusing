Cool like a summertime pool in the winter
Im thee raporilla, I heat like gorillas
Who the fuck's you? They call me Sick Boi
If you try to get the kryptonite on me
You're gonna have to D-I-E
[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(It's Sick Boi, it's back)
The nigga is amazing
(Y'all know who it is)
The nigga is amazing
(Get wildin' like me)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
I'm not Lil Weezy but my pocket size silly
Got the purple hoody and the purple Gobstoppers
My momma used to tell me I was lost like Chaka
Now I got the yellow truck like my name Tonka
Got to philosophize my mind like Plato
What'd y'all say though?
[Chorus]
The nigga is amazing
(See I don't play around)
The nigga is amazing
(See when I say I'mma do something)
The nigga is amazing
(I say I do something)
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
The nigga is amazing
(Yo do this for real though)
The nigga is amazing
(I'mma try to kick it for real)
The nigga is amazing
My hat broke off and my hoodie so sick
Yo I go to Bellevue cause my flow is insane, man
[Chorus Outro]
The nigga is amazing
(I said stay wildin' like me boi)
The nigga is amazing
(I came back with a vengeance)
The nigga is amazing
(I put down the pen so I could focus again)
The nigga is amazing
Fuck Yourself!
(S'why I don't write shit)
The nigga is amazing
