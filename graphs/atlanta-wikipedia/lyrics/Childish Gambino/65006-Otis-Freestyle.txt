[Produced by Kanye West]
My tongue's hurting, from all of its work cursing
And I'm not certain, I think my father's LeVar Burton
Till I'm walking in circles and I'm talking in third person
That'll walk inside your class and make fun of your school shooting
Gwen Steffani can holla back
I'm not black, I'm a white boy with dark skin
At a Klan rally wondering why they won't let me in
D to the O's got a flow like menstrual cycles
Change my face every year like Michael... Jackson
I bust guts like I bust a rhyme
I bust nuts like I'm Busta Rhymes
And I ain't even gotta do it, I ain't have the time
On Community
Fly girls wanna get inside my booty
Or is it the other way around
Cause I'm skating on a skateboard
At Peachtree, Atlanta, Stone Mountain till I die
Horny motherfucker from the Stone Mountain Georgia
