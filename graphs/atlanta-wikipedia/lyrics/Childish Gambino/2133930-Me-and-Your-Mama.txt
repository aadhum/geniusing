[Hook]
Do what you want
I'm telling you
Let me into your heart
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you
Let me into your heart
Do you really love me?
I'ma get you, girl, ahhhh!
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see the sun
Let me into your heart
Oh, this ain't no bullshit
I really love you, girl
Oh, oh God
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Let me in
Girl you really got a hold, woo!
