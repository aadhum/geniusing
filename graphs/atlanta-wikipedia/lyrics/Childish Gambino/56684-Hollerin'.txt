So a nigga got bounce like a pinball game
I got housewives like my name was Bravo
The dude is Bueller, the world Chicago
I'm hard to follow, ya boy's sick
I'm Adam Sandler so fuck ya clique
I hang with dogs like Michael Vick
Cause your boy stay fresh like a bunch of mints
And I fight this flow like a pacifist
A barrel of monkeys, a house of chimps
I'm way more fun than your boyfriend is
Cause your boy right here where the action is, ah!
I said these niggas mad at me like Baby Mammas
These niggas slept on me like old pajamas
You niggas stay soft like Jon Secada
And this nigga stay lit like a candelabra
I would still have cream like Beard Papa
I got no limits like Silkk the Shocker
You look too sweet like Betty Crocker
My boy in the back, you could meet my partner
But he ain't got a girl so you should bring your partner
Ya boy got books like he made of lockers
The girl got legs like a pair of Dockers
You should shake that shit 'til you got maracas
