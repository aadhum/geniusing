*******[PLAY SONG "PINK TOES" AT THIS POINT]*******
But I feel like anything we put here wouldn't do justice to what really happens when a person you meet ends up in your life out of nowhere. But know that it's exactly how you expect it to be, but also more.
It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says "I'll protect you", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything.
They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time.
But it was still kinda fun up to this point
NAOMI: Howbout'sm China, IL?
You don't really trust anyone
The Boy stops. She got em
I don't want to be right. I wanna help you
THE BOY (said dumb): "I don't wanna be right"
She doesn't laugh. He hopes she's LOLing inside. Cellphone vibrates on the counter across from them. The Boy goes over and reads the text
Nothing real is ever "fine". Remember this
They don't see each other anymore
The Boy is driving down the highway listening to "Danny Glover" by Young Thug
When he pulls up, he's playing "Made in America" by JAY Z and Kanye. When it goes off, he continues singing his version while walking up

       THE BOY: Sweet Cream Havarti/ Sweet Mozzarella/ Sweet Cheez-its. They're made in America/ Sweet Bowl of Cheez-its/ Ohhhhh-oohhhhh-
Four dudes are standing waiting at the front door

Something is wrong

The Boy stops singing and stands there in front of the dudes. They look at him
Alone

They all pull out 45s
****[PLAY SONG "EARTH: THE OLDEST COMPUTER" AT THIS POINT]****
The feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties.
People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is "fine", or that they don't have all the power
One dude packs the bricks from
The closet in a trash bag.
But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place. The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning. People wouldn't live like they do
If I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's "We'll Die" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle

...try to do your best
Oh! It's like Tony Montana. But resigned and, frankly, more realistic, cause it's boring. Everybody dies. Most of them are boring
THE BOY: Can I drown?

Dude 2 looks up

       THE BOY (CONT'D): I just want to die how I want

There's a pool out there. You're supposed to get this wave of euphoria when you drown. Supposed to be good
He's a cop. This nigga's a cop
The Boy looks to the pool in the backyard and sees his own body floating lifeless
[VISUAL]

Eyes wide, bubbles clinging to his face. Orange, yellow, and brown leaves float above him. His left shoe floating far ahead, probably from struggling at some point. Next to the pool, Naomi and Steve stand over him. Neither is crying or really seem too upset.  They just look on as if the movie they were watching took an abrupt turn and they're mildly interested rather than satisfied
It looks peaceful. Fitting. He'd like to go out like that
Dude 1 turns to The Boy and sho
...(breath).....(breath).............(breath)..
