Tell me what the faith is, flow is on a wait list
You live, you learn, you wait your turn and you crush 'em
Still flip with these young hoes, still stunt with these fly clothes
Still rep for that East side where they bang toys like Tyco
I'm busy one percentin', I'm rapper Armageddon
Introducin' all that bullshit all these other niggas spittin'
Yo it's Childish, I'm wild, bitch, all white coke like scientist
Stupid busy, fuckin' with your main like a lioness
Nigga scrunch your face up, all we get it queso
All we watch is cartoons, hatin' man, that's all you
Fuckboy, that's all you, say shit when I saw you
Say shit on that online but that's fake beef like dog food
These Silver Lake niggas know hood like a clitoris
Bang, bang, bang, bang, shots fired,
A-Town, Empire
