[Intro]
Yes it is
A crime is a crime
From the tiniest marble that rolls down a storm drain
To an autographed baseball that rolls down a storm drain
Now who's doing this
I'm in, I'm in
To the storm drain
No Charlie
No
Good morning, I gotta take a stand
Nigga this who I be, nigga this who I am
be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
I be ridin' forever, I be ridin' forever
Childish Gambino
Hot as Nevada, Reno
Niggas that say, what he know
Give me five like I'm Tito
I never touched a kilo
Opposite Al Pacino
I keep a light saber like I fuck around with Greedo
It's time to be a grown-up
Riding on diplomas
Damn this beat is so nuts
Thank you, MC DJ
Yeah, my mouth is nasty
Like I gave a BJ
I don't give a fizzuck
These niggas are out of lizzuck
This nigga is off the hizzook
Like walking out a prison
For me I see the vision
Casino money like Navajo
Their money says, Geronimo
My money comes in lotto dough
Call me Mr. Masturbate
Tighter than your jerking grip
You looser than some turkey neck
Haters need to listen up
My attitude's a prostitute who broke
Cause she don't give a fuck
The game is afoot
the mystery's at hand
pilfer podiums
in other words we take a stand
We like to ride our bikes, mother fuck a mystery van
Stop and listen be shoplifting 'pocalyptic Stephen King
I take a stand, fuck the man
Now will you please pull that string
I need your case and a dime
But we also take Fruit Roll-Ups
Like a vampire on a bus
No shit Sherlock,
mad like Murdock
Nanu, nanu, nanu, nanu
[Outro: Childish Gambino]
This comedy movie was not fun to make
At all
So when you're sitting in your living room and you're yucking it up
Or in the theater
Or, you know, and you're saying oh with your little friends
Oh this is so funny
It's not funny
We started making this five years ago and we're still trying to get shit right
I'm going to get some Cheez-Its from Krafty
