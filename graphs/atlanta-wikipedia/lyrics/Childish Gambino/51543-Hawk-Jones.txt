My flow like Hawk Jones
The little bitty one
I'm sicker than your grandparents honey
I'm sicker than that bitch at the end of Ben Button
Eat these other rappers rhymes
That is why my breath stink
These frito banditos
Cause they're like chips
Cause they talk shit see me then dip
These niggas round here
They don't let your tongue slip
Send you black and blue
Like you an African crip
My green like a weird watermelon
No seeds
And my green like a weird watermelon
All leaves
My green don't fit in my white skinny jeans
Cause I move anywhere
So I guess I'm the queen
He's so confused cause he thought I was a boy
Well I got two Mounds but no Almond Joy
Infatuation thick like a slab of good brie
But they not intolerant
They daydream more than moderate
It's just not a meal until you sprinkle Parmesan on it
It's just not a get until you give all you got on it
It's just not a cock until you pumpin' all of your heart in it
Ain't they thicker than a pair of African hips
How's it feel to kiss me knowing I am not there
Or the black Ed Grimly
Girl attitude stay stank like kimchi
But she ain't Korean and her boy ain't friendly
Turn your girls that are friends to fuck buddies
Keep em on the wire
That's why I cuddy
I am Animaniac cause I'm so wacko
Better warn a brother when you see a chick act ho
And even if she's so Angel that she's on Bones
No girl is so fly to fuck with Hawk Jones
