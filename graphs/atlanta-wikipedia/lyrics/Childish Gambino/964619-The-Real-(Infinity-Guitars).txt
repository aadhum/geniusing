Niggas thought that I was kiddin'
These raps are not my sketches
I don't need this money, but I spend it like I wanna
Shit just got real like Pinocchio turds
And your bitch can't sleep cause she used to my bed
Hidin' from you bitches cause real nigga's hard to find
I do not talk, yeah my life a library
And these niggas ain't shit so I guess they must be urine
I'mma act and rap, Will Smith this bitch
When rappers start rappin' over indie shit
Just remember I was first to hit this shit
