[Verse 1]
Little hands, little feet
Tiny heart, tiny beat
Oh, thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you, I don't wanna deceive you
But oh, when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my, please don't take him away, mama
Don't take him away, oh
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
All the pain, all the tears
Many nights, many years
This love for me is fading
You waited, but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh, please don't take him away
You said you won't but you will, yes you will
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close, I hope I stay close
(Don't take my baby boy)
There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Though these bodies are not our own
(I hope I stay close)
Walk tall, little one, walk tall
(Don't take my baby boy)
(Don't take my pride and joy)
Let me hold you, let me hold you
(I hope I stay close)
Can I hold you?
