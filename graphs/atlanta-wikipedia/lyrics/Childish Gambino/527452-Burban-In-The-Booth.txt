Riz is not the type of spitter, to write a bit of shit about the bitches, ice and glitter
I find it limiting, I'd rather print the bigger picture
Them bars are boring like they only pouring pints of bitter
Riz, I'm an actor but I'm realer than most
Songs banned cause the lines are so bold
Switch like bricks on the latch that go from alcohol to powder nose
Sniff up her lips, on the prowl for coke, but the dealer was shifty, sold him a load of panadol
Rappers so fashion school, look like Timmy Mallet do
Mallet you, push your pineapple till you Agadoo
Shit's ruthless like Trishner's abusers
People confuse me for Rooney, no lie
Think I'm the star from 3, but I mean 4 lions
Got some goons to hold my money, must be ballin' hard
Mama, no more Arizona Jeans, that shit's embarrasin'
I got a [?] jacket and me and my brother sharin' it
I ain't trynna see you on the first 48
Wonder if God hears when an atheist prays
I don't know what I should tell them: That we royalty? That they spoil me?
all I do is win and make Azealia's last name
Brought a knife to a gun show, brought a gun to a bear fight
Grizzly bear screams in my hair when I say "night."
Go on, let 'em know woo
