But as Glover says in Community, "You just wrinkled my brain man!" This wrinkled the fuck out of my brain for sure, so go ahead and read it
In the "Worst Guys" video with Chance the Rapper,
at around 1:47, you can see a gash in his leg . This is presumably how the alien entered his body
In "Sweatpants," it is implied that Alien Gambino slowly is infecting the world. This concept is showcased throughout the video in the diner, where all of the guests slowly turn into him
In his "Urn" video the aliens seem to communicate with each other through interpretive dance
In his "3005" video,
everybody behind Gambino seemed to be teenagers or young adults. Note how the Teddy Bear also remained looking clean and new.
If you fast forward in the video, you will see the people in the seem to be aging, and the teddy bear has deterioted.
In his "Zealots of Stockholm [Free Information]" video, take note of how the theme park is on fire. This is presumably the Gambaliens taking over the world. As the world crumbles and burns, one figure stands silently watching over everything. This is presumably the Gambino alien himself
At the end of his "Telegraph Ave. (Oakland by Lloyd)" video, Gambino reveals his true alien form to Naomi (Jhen√© Aiko), provoked by a strong feeling of love, but also fear upon seeing the headlights.
(I also have another theory which I will post later, upon how this all started with camp.)
