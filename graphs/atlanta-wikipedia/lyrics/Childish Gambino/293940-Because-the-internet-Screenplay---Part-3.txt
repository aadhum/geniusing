*******[PLAY SECRET TRACK 9 1/2 [CODED] NOW]*******

(do not read on while "Secret track" plays. Wait until it is finished, then continue reading)
****[PLAY "PLAYING AROUND BEFORE THE PARTY STARTS" NOW]****
The Boy sits at his piano; playing randomly, trying to make sense of everything/anything.
MISLA
They're arguing about driving, or cooking with coconut oil instead of olive oil, or something else they themselves will not care about or remember in a month, year, ten years, 100 years, the age of the universe
The house is starting to look pretty bad. The cleaners that used to come stopped receiving their payment and stopped coming. Plastic cups are starting to spread like a blue rash across the living room and coffee tables. Every surface has a sticky spot. You used to be able to slide into the kitchen from the living room with a two second run and quick stop. Now, dried alcohol stops you before you even get to the kitchen door. The Boy really loved sliding into the kitchen when he was a kid. It was the closest you could get to having powers
*******[PLAY SONG "THE PARTY" AT THIS POINT]*******
Fam daps up a kid as he walks in.
They then walk over to a closet where Fam opens up a pantry of weed.
It's not nostalgic rap video stocked with weed, but there's a lot of weed in there.
Fam tosses an ounce of weed at the kid.
The kid and his friend smell it and nod.
They look to Fam to share a smile of like "good shit, right?",
but Fam isn't there for em. Fam gives em the "where's my money you privileged ass-hole" look.
They pull out some hundreds
s'mores
Emily and Steve are jumping over the fire pit like idiots
There are people saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. Everyone has a purpose tonight. It's a great time
...this is a waste
THE BOY: Get

...of time

       THE BOY (CONT'D): Out. Everyone

No one can hear him. It's a party


       THE BOY (CONT'D): Everyone needs to get out. NOW!
People start to notice. The Boy gets up from the piano and grabs a pool stick. He quickly walks over to the ipod dock playing music and winds up like it's a bat

SMASH

Everyone stares
SOME DUDE 2: Worldstar!
(NAOMI)
THE BOY: Get out! Get away!
Sriracha
ROSCOE'S WETSUIT
Fam gives him a SMH.
*******[PLAY SONG "NO EXIT" AT THIS POINT]*******
He sees a spider in the corner of the room. Just sitting in its web
I'm not sure where he's driving.
Then, barefoot, he sits on the roof of his car and watches the cars pass. Bright lights grow to an explosion then fade out as they pass.
He goes into his pocket and holds the "hackz" flash drive that we saw on his desk at the beginning
FATBURGER
The Boy orders a burger in the drive thru
A skinny Latino kid with a Bluetooth hands him the bag. The Boy pulls over to the side and opens the bag. He looks at the burger for a moment
The Boy throws the burger out
But at the same time, if someone got up there, it'd be easy to figure out how to get in
The Boy walks over to The Buddha in the middle of the foyer.
He used to be terrified of this Buddha. When he was little, he'd run behind the statue like it would jump on him as soon as he past. But He slowly became something like a best friend. Something like that
pours Pelligrino into a wine glass
He takes the top off the grinder and pours the white powder inside the glass.
Where'd it go? Why would it leave? What about its parents? Won't they be sad? What a bout hi s frien ds?
