Good little girl
Always picking a fight with me
You know that I'm bad
But you're spending the night with me
What do you want from my world?
You're a good little girl
Bad little boy
That's what you're acting like
I really don't buy
That you're that kind of guy
And, if you are
Why do you want to hang out with me?
