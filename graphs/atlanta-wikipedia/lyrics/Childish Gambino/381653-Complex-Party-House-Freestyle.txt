Balling like Jabari Parker, they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward
Break out the Sudafed, cause the flow cold like a SoCo
I was smoking John Lennon with my Yoko
[?]
[?]
I'm in the the mood so we ball out
she giving me that genius
MENSA,
we that Tony Danza
Lying on my rug, bitch you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka
green so Tonka
Vape so good, I ain't gotta smoke blanca
I'm going HAM like a cop car
