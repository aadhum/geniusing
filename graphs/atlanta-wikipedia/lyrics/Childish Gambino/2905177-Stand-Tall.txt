When the sun is rising over streets so barren
I feel like a child, so young and new in '92
I listened to what my father said
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong, you cannot fall
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can
How this used to feel so far and free
Now these broken souls are all I see
Fists have fallen to our side
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
Oh I, nah, nah, nah
If you are strong, you cannot fall
If you are strong
There is a voice inside us all
So smile when you can, when you can
There is more to you and me
There is more than they can see
I'm on your side, woo, oh
There is more out there
And somebody cares 'bout you
I do
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
There is more out there
Keep all your dreams, keep standing tall
If you are strong you cannot fall
When they're gone, keep to yourself
