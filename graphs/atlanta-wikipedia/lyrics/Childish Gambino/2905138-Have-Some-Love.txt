Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
You got the power, you got the power
It's getting hot, it's like a sauna
Then every night, in Arizona
I got the business to make a mind
I got the business to make a mind
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find, have a word
There's a big wide world out there, I need to get in
We have got to bring this thing together (we gotta stay together)
And I hope and I pray, we will find it someday
We have got to really stay together (are we stayin'?), soâ€”
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
Have a word for your brother
Have some time for one another
Really love one another
It's so hard to find
