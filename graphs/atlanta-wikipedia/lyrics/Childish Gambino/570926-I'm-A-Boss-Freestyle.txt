See I be riding through my old hood, same old attitude
Only time that she quiet, when my thing is inside her
Don’t you know I’m a writer
And I slip her a 50, just to keep her 100
So hood, man what you talking bout
Man, I’m watching Law and Order on my grandma’s couch
Eating Lucky Charms for dinner
Me and Blake Griffin
Ha, we stay fly like the end of Grease
