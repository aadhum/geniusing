I do not talk, I am just a rapper
Sick boy make moves like a chess piece
And that move real quick like Nestle
et me make it clear for a second like Pepsi
I was never worried bout my wallet bein empty
Cause when it was empty, I was still happy
Walkin with my Walkman, freestyle rappin
High school bullies like what the fuck happened
Nigga off the hook like I fuckin shot the captain
And this is me relaxing, rapping is my hobby
I did this in my bedroom where I separate my laundry
Watchin old episodes of Shining Time Station
You are now listening to my mouth on vacation (ation)
Why you doing this, what's your motivation?
I am just a rapper, I don't need the paper
No Will Smith went off without a hitch man
C-H-I-L-D it's the ISH man
Do sixteen bars no wristband
I'll always be childish, call me Maggie Simpson
Run the track like my tongue's an Olympian
I've always been this good, you just weren't listening
You started rapping when you wasn't good at basketball
I started rapping cause I fucking need some Adderall
I can't do one thing, I'm just too good
I can't do one thing, I am Tiger Woods
Bitch sitting shotgun in my Tracy Chapman
Stay hard like my suit made by Tony Stark
This kinda music make your balls drop, Dick Clark
