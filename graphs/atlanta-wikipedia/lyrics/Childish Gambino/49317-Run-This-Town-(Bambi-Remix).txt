[Intro: Rihanna]
It's C.G. boy, king of the black nerds
I gotta get my Urkel on
I won't stop until I see an afro at Comic-Con
And not just Samurai
I was an outcast, nickname Aquemini
I'm in a hot pink hoodie, I ain't ever scared
[Hook: Rihanna]
We are, yea I said it we are
It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
Yea, it's hard to stay grounded
When you're Andre and MST 3000
All rolled into one nigga
I 69 a 49er boy, gold diggers
