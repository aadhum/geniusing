[Verse 1: Childish Gambino]
And if it wasn't be you, then who's it gonna be?
Black man no perfect, white man no perfect
A million leaders just millimeters from grabbing heaters
But we don't see each other, yeah I'm fine now
America my foster care
I'm posted up on corners with rocks in hand
My big brother taught me how to go and move how a crook move
"Walk tall in the streets, don't be shook, dude"
You might be joking but you're still hood
They wanna say "nigga, what's up?" Woah
