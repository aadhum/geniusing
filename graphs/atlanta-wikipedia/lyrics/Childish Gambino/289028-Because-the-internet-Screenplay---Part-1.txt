[VISUAL]
You can't live your life on a bus...
EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
A white bus
opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming.
After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A
LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber
All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end
A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy
CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is

He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo
The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door.
The limo starts off

The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours
FATHER: How was camp?

The Boy "shrugs"
FATHER (CONT'D): You make any friends?

       THE BOY: No

The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh
FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight
Frito pie
FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-
THE BOY (cutting him off): It's Frito pie
Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window
EXT. MANSION - DAY
The Chauffeur helps Father out the car.
The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic
INT. MANSION - DAY
An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs.
You can see all of this from the foyer,
which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it.
The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care
The Father's phone rings:

       FATHER: Hello

       PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-

Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off
he Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy.
The Boy throws up a deuce.
He gets a s'more Pop tart,
then walks back out
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway
He kicks off his shoes
They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground.
We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years
Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice
The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth
as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop.
There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995.
The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video
He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT".
The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying
"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future!
[CRYING EMOJI]
The Boy stares. Then types "fuck u niggers" in the comments

He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart

He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with "Fuck U", "You wouldn't say that to my face faggot", and "LMFAO crackers b crazy"

The Boy smiles
...bec a use the in t e  rnet
15 YEARS LATER
*******[PLAY SONG "CRAWL" AT THIS POINT]*******
The room is an elegant mess.
There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place.
Classic furniture;
someone with old money would invest in,
You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer
There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk
There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk
flash drive that has "hackz" written on it.
A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge.
There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk
There's a black and white Bill Withers poster,
a Gorillaz "Demon Days" poster,
and a "Black Dynamite" poster. All framed.
Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf.
Norman Connors "You Are My Starship" is the album on top of the others
Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there.
The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts.
very old and tattered Shearling coat
The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts.
He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up
The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen
S'mores makings left out
The marshmallows are hard as stones.
He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave
(you're not supposed to do that)
blue sparks start to pop inside
The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background
The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there.
FAM
[PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]
An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop.
FAM: Let's take one of yours
THE BOY: Nah
Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my ca
THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous

       FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?
"...why do you even care?"
Tesla Model S
Silver 911
some car no one's ever seen
a Tahoe
Aston Martin
The beamer
We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head
FAM: Nah...nah

They get in the 911
FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?
The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name "You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar"
You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc.
His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite.
He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights
He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
...someone tweeted "roscoe's wetsuit"
"...what's that?"
The Boy drops "roscoe's wetsuit" into Google.
A Yahoo answer comes up for it.
The answer to "what is roscoe's wetsuit?" is..."roscoe's wetsuit". Hilarious
SWANK,
STEVE,
MARCUS (Chance the Rapper),
and AJ (STEFAN)
SWANK (re: boards): How we supposed to get these in there?
We need a bigger car then. I'mma drive to your house and get the Tahoe
Come on, guys. This is taking forever
FAM: Dockweiler
Shut the fuck up!
Porsche
What's "roscoe's wetsuit" mean?
EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY
bringing girls
You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house
STEVE: Why white girls?

       MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-
At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black
MARCUS (CONT'D to AJ): See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me

A plane flies low overhead. (Dockweiler is right next to LAX)

       MARCUS (CONT'D) (staring at the plane)
It's gonna crush me
SWANK (re: girl): It's like seeing a mermaid

       STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee
MARCUS (R. Kelly): I'mma flirt
SASHA:
"Kangaroo Jack"?
fucking
Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth
SWANK: How long you been surfing?
       SASHA: Ten years. You?
       SWANK: Bouta month
AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?
And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed
AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using "Dream Lover" to transition,
play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour,
hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy
Twercules. no "DJ". Just Twercules. I got a tumblr where I post my mixes.
You sing? Model? Act?
AJ: I shouldn't have said "bitches"
       MARCUS (thinks): ...you didn't
This is probably saying more about him than he realizes
...roscoe's wetsuit
THE BOY: Everyone else was
       SASHA: That's an awful reason
EDIT
EDIT
I'll remember. I'll bring some friends
*******[PLAY SONG "WORLDSTAR" AT THIS POINT]*******
The guys drive down the highway eating In-N-Out
Swank is now driving the Porsche. Crazily.
animal style fries
It's fine
FAM: He's driving crazy. (iphone goes off) And he's textin me

The text says: R E C K L E S S
[HEART EMOJI]
[LAUGHING/CRYING EMOJI]
Fam and Cheese dap.
The Boy stands on the side next to a line of people trying get in VIP. They look at each other.
He is not dressed appropriately to get in
Fam and Cheese do that handshake thing they do.
(I GUESS?)
POP. POP

..what's happening?
POP. POP
COP: Drop your weapon!

(these are cleaner and succinct) POP.POP.POP
The blood on the sidewalk is almost black.
A street sign (No parking between 7-9am and 4-7pm) is reflected in the dark blood.
That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state
The Boy felt something
There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-
SOME NIGGA: Damnnnnn.....!
HIS FRIEND: WORLDSTAR!
The Boy's phone rings:

       THE BOY: Yeah
Donnie Darko
The Boy touches his shearling coat
...i shouldn't be (here)
The Boy just keeps watching the video
FAM: Wow...you caught the end of his journey on video. That's dope. (then) We gotta pic up Doc from the jazz club
INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
THE BOY: I'm not trippin. I'm just sayin, if you think about it, there's no reason for us to be here
Doc be hanging with the weirdest people.
Look at these niggas. They all look like James Blake.
Is that who likes Jazz now?
I was thinking about it and I can't offer anyone anything. Like, my job is tweeting at people. That's my job
FAM: That's not your job. You do it cause it's funny. You're rich. We don't have to do anything

       THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?
FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?
And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope
But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once
FAM: Then don't make a shirt, my nigga
JAMES BLAKEY LOOKING DUDE: Shhh!
The Boy fiddles with the hole in his jacket
s'more fixings
If I was the director, I'd have everyone walk in in slow motion into the house with "Nosetalgia" by Pusha T playing
Walking into bedrooms. Opening drawers. Pulling out bags of weed
CUT TO:

AJ walks into his large closet. Pulls out a bowl. There are some prescription bottles there too
CUT TO:

A naked Marcus steps out of the shower and goes in his closet and pulls out some condoms
CUT TO:

Fam is meditating in the center of his bed. He's floating off the bed by about 4 inches
This is the end of Part 1, continue on at Part 2
