[Intro: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows, sunshine, everywhere we go
Rainbows, sunshine, go
[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
I thought I told you 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
You don't leave home without it
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
(Move that kilo, move that kilo)
She on my back about it
C3PO, C3PO, C3PO
And all the time
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
How could you ever question?
They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who, what, why, and where
They sport the flyest pairs, she got the nicest hair
And she know life is better Qith this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy po-pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk, now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night—go
[Hook: Childish Gambino]
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
Rainbows, sunshine
[Interlude]
Jhene Aiko's angelic harmonizing
[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
He slangs, his yay, through the corridors
Every day, 20K, yep, at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you, but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
Cause I know one day
You could take me away, far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made, there'll be plenty of sunshine
I never worry 'bout it
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
(Act like you know)
I have my nigga count it
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
(Back up them O's)
She's dressed up in gold
Dressed up in gold, C3PO, C3PO
I'm out of time
Act like you know
Act like you know
Act like you know
[Outro]
I'm out of time, I'm out of time, I'm out of time (Go)
