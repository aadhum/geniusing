[Produced by Childish Gambino]
Street niggas, hood rats, ladies and gentlemen
Childish Gambino greater than sign everyone
Apples to oranges, Jay Leno to Letterman
Got a cool whip and my girl ass gelatin
God dammit we the boys with the illest rain
Royalty forever and the rest is just a silly game
Still learnin' how to work your girlfriend's genitals
Still buyin' sweaters off of 30 Rock residuals
Money change everything, these bitches always down to ride
Especially if you keep they nose gentrified
Money off of curse words, I hope my mama's proud of me
Man, I've done it all, so I guess we both prodigies
From PJs to PJs, that's projects to privates
Now you understand my fuckin' mindset, let 'em know
And push you over in my bottomless pit of sixteens
Alchemist rapper transform on your shape-shift
Kundalini Key on the pyramid
I crush you little pussies like sex, who's next?
I'm sittin' on a bunch of green faces
So my wallet is an alien invasion
Or a spaceship, my crew's the illest
So we Aaahh!!! real monsters, Nicktoons Ickis
That line's the stupidest, but it be lucrative
And P my motherfuckin' nigga so I call him dad
Yeah I'm a motherfucker too, birthed a lot of sons
[?]
Clean me up, but you can't change what's in my head
My flow go to earth, we the ill pandemic
We smoke the whole barn up, bitch I'm on my high horse
You don't watch Community? Girl, what is you lyin' for?
Bitch, I got immunity
I want a hood life, cash and clothes
then get ghosts like Casper though
Childish Gambino, show a nigga that you with him say "ayo"
