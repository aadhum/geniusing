You are the bestest, I will obey you
They wanna know what, I couldn't say who
You are the only one who's ever really seen me
I know that I'm the reason that you don't watch any TV
I wanna lay on your stomach so bad
And it gets a little quiet in this bachelor pad
And I don't really understand the thing we had
I wanna try again, but it would just be sad
You are the only one who's ever let me be me
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me
I'll be waiting right there
Promise to be gentle
Sittin' by your window
Girl, you're so fly to me
