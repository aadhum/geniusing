Is it really that bad that my clothes is tight?
That I hydrate babes like Pedialyte
I rock shows with the blue lightsaber
I hit dimes but also date eighters
I make moves,
blow up like Al-Qaeda
I'm in kicks that you can't buy yet
Ya kicks okay like your name Wyatt
Care Bear Clockers
Haters wanna snatch my heat like firefighters
Boys out there think they just like me
Naw naw, y'all funny, y'all from UCB?
Y'all standin' in line, I'm in VIP
Y'all know shit 'bout me like TIP, hah!
Think your voice's funny man, that's kind of hilarious
Because my rhymes so fresh, green grocers' gotta spray 'em
From the PM to the AM I'll slay 'em with the sawed-off
MC without Glover is Murtaugh without Riggs
One smokes Kinds, the other smokes Mids
Bacardi and Coke, black and white cookie
We're up to no good, please don't tell our mamas
Sicker than Old Yeller, money like bank tellers
The chicks that I'm with are thicker than Nutella
Y'all need to switch quick and get with a sick fella
Cause I'm bout to go Rihanna like I'm an Umbrella
And make some mistakes like Jamie Lynn Spears
I'm nasty? No. Forward? Yes
I'm hip to the game, you're a rook like chess
My money so long that they call it John Silver's
Boutique killers, you can see
They close up shop when the clerks see me
I'm not Kanye, but my collar's popped
You got the yellow face, that's my lemonade
Stay in the Bay with green like Brett Farve
