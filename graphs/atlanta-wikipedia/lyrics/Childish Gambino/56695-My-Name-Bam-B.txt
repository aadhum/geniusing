I got my shit checked like Nike
Doctor said he'd never seen anything like me
Chances of recovery are nil to not likely
Boy so crazy make your baby mama look sane
Kicking thoughts around like he got a loose brain
I got a whiskey sour, sober
Until I fall down like it's mid-October
Young young Hova
Boy I say, for goodness sake
I'm in my prime like I'm standing on my dinner plate
You niggas innerspace cause you come up Martin Short
I'm so fly I don't need a right wing from Drudge Report
Ah! Stay wildin' like me!
My name Bam-B!
[Verse 2: G.E.T.H.]
I've got a blue belt from Renzo Gracie
Read the news today, oh boy, some kids are dead
Pulled the covers over my head and went straight back to bed
Seriously trust me, you wouldn't wanna be me
The best days of my life involve leftovers and TV
I got almost no friends and I don't know how to handle this
Even the friends I do got are all moving to Los Angeles
Even I'm tired of my whining
Even I don't want no more of me
I whine more than a 3-year old multiplied by Morrisey
Every time I meet someone who wants to be my friend
The first thought that I have is, "Yo what the fuck is wrong with them?"
I go through life with my fists up
I'm depressed y'all
Someone please help me (Please help me)
Seriously (Seriously right now)
Help
I'm good with the N
No not the Nina
Mean I'm good with the hammer so I'll fix your broke heater
And not your bro Keeter
I don't tote guns
I never had white so I never needed one
And the hood respect me, I rose from the ashes
They call me the phoenix in the clear rim glasses
Now I got my own enterprise, call me Kirk
And I'm born on an air force base, so I'm fly
Move out to Decatur, that's Atlanta's Bed-Stuy
I got that pink like pussy
Got that pussy day and night so they call me Kid Cudi
Bitch!
