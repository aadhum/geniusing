They used to think that I was dumber and dumber
I use to give a rubber
I'm from Australia like 5 Seconds of Summer
Niggas know that I don't play
I be surfing off the Gold Coast
Niggas like a goal post
[Verse 2: Steve G. Lover]
royalty be the team
spending a lot of cream
Spending lotta green, on these bitches with [?] ass
Nah, I don't sleep never
my weed light like a fuckin' feather
In Sydney I know I have to come with my own shit, 'cuz you shit don't smoke
You know me I feel like I be doing what I for [?]
Royalty the shit put your hands up
If you that Gambino is the shit, put your hands up
I'm the best rapper, definitely top 5
If these other rappers think they boy they fuckin' not alive
I cut their head off, that's every rapper living
That's Kendrick, that's Drake, that's Schoolboy, that's everyone
I don't give a fuck, I'll fucking kill you niggas (I'll fucking kill you niggas)
These niggas think I'm bigger, uh
God damn, motherfucker, I'm ill
All I do is freestyle, take a fuckin' pill
'Cuz you about to be sick, nigga I'm so sick
I came in your girls face, she don't know what got hit
She gotta close her eyes, she gotta close her eyes
"Donald Glover, why you cum in my eye?"
I'm like "sorry boo, I gotta come up inside"
