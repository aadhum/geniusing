Gin in my cup, so I ain't so sober
Girl on my dick, call me Cassanova
Got the gold top like I'm one of the Brady's
'Scuse me ladies! I know you wanna shoot me
Like my name's Jay Brady
but the cameras pay me
I wanna eat good Iike Rachel Ray
My voice too high 'sposed to hold me back
They say the same fucking thing cause I'm young and black
Opposites attract
So not far from me is white dude with low voice and no money
Who gives a fuck if my voice sound funny
Fuck friends, I got me a bi-buddy
I'm true life Iike I'm MTV
Nike so tight they make your fuckin' feet hurt
Money so big call me Ceezie's dick
I shine so bright they should call me sunlight
Call me punk rock cause my jeans is too tight
Day eights and up, that my standard
Show 'em who's boss like Tony Danza
With my bootleg sex, why masturbate
Me and Lupe got it kick push
I used to have to sweep floors just to make the ends meet
The ends meetin' like a motherfucker. Ain't that sweet?
Why I'm deep with the kids like Phish on myspace
Now I'm on your fish scales like I hang with Ghostface
They say black don't crack, except for Whitney
My shit don't crack, I fall off like Britney
To put it simply, I lose my balance
Cause I got a pink drink and it makes me tipsy
You want my advice to get the five mics
You wanna put them fake ass guns away
Nah, I'm just kiddin' nigga, you ain't got a chance anyway
