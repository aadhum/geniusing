"From now on, that'll be, like, our little thing, like you're, like, a little version of me. I'm carrying you around like-- like in a papoose. It would be amazing."
Said I’m so official, all I need is a whistle
I stole that line from Wheezy and Lil’ Drizzle
Sick like a preemie
I shop so I mall cop, call a nigga Paul Blart
Girls used to say, “Nope!” - like they watch P&R
Now they say yes because I’m on before P&R
I don’t wear that fuckin’ jewelry, it’s bad for your health
See, where I come from, they would hit you where you’re walkin’
Rip your fuckin’ chain off, leave you in a coffin
Stay Stone Mountain
mc DJ
Chillin’ on my sofa watchin’ Venture Bros. Blu-rays
I don’t run no drains, bitch, call my shit the highway
Blacker than Mugabe, Whiter than the album
I guess I’m in the middle, so call a nigga Malcolm
DIY - do it yourself, nigga don’t try
“Please, just do it!” The girl sound Nike
Girls I don’t know give my penis oral hygiene
My dick plays the field like my dick won a Heisman
Niggas talkin’ shit and that shit don’t surprise me
And I’m so official, got a badge and a nightstick
Young Young Hova
Dress the turd up slutty, make the shit look easy
Elroy made a funny on you slow ones
Stepping on these short guys like I’m in The Shire
I am slow Orlando, oops, late bloomer
Rapping’s a religion, and nigga I’m the provost
Nigga, this is simple
Shout out to black nerds, shout out to white ones
Shout out to Asians, keep playin’ Street Fighter
Shout out to nerd chicks in glasses, sweeter than cinnamon
Me and Sick Boi are synonyms
People hear my voice and say, “What happened to Eminem?!
This shit is absurd! He’s saying the n-word!”
Naw, it’s just Bam-B.
The nigga that’s crazy for giving shit free
And fuck iTunes, I’m doin’ it OG
Nigga, call me Elroy
because I’m so high
That you cannot measure
I’m losing cabin pressure
I’m so official, I’m the Foot Locker logo, nigga
