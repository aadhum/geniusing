Abella Anderson
but no one, not even THE BOY, knows who she is
“3005″ lyric video, Abella Anderson is a cam girl and is in a private show with THE BOY
ALYSSA
(hey, remember that thing about the Callifax Collection Company?)
I don’t believe in small talk
I’m still in it
We’re not together
But it’s a relationship, for sure
I don’t get it
I used to watch her online a while back
Then it just started turning into talking
But then why doesn’t know/remember her in “Clapping For The Wrong Reasons”
no matter how much you interact with someone online, you never truly know who they are.
