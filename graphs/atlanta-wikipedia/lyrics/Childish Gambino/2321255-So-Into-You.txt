With every passing moment, thoughts of you run through my head
I am slowly realizing, I think you're truly heaven-sent
I think you're truly something special, just what my dreams are really made of
Let's stay together you and me boy, there's no one like you around
Oh my
I really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into you
Really like what you've done to me
I can't really explain it, I'm so into
The way that you hold me, might be the things that you say
I don't know what it is boy, but I know I like feeling this way
Let's stay together you and me boy, there's no one like you around
