Nigga I'm tight like BVD
Nigga I'm sick like CDC
All my shit be classic, yours gets skipped like DVDs
This beat be droppin' acid, do we have to tell 'em so?
Keysha got me percocets I'm chillin' and it's hella dope
Tell 'em ho, I ain't Tebow, I don't pray for change
All I do is do it, I'm Nike,
I'm drinking Gatorade
I got my hoodie so I gotta be a gangster
Why Geraldo Rivera look like a child molester?
we the ill pandemic
Sick boy
nigga, yeah we royalty forever
All my G-O-O-Ns are well-spoken
One white guy, he's a classic token
Asses open, droppin' shit
Man fuck down like a mersey
Smell these niggas like an armpit
They be making white girls like 'Ye did Taylor Swift
Roll up on niggas like fruit snacks
Motherfucker that's too bad
That's like - countin' fat stacks out in Harlem
That's like - fucking Kat Stacks with no condom
Stupid, everybody out here needs to cool it
Rap stepfather, no more hanging in the pool shit
That Gambino girls are royalty now nigga that's an army!
Street monsters, where the fuck is Gordon?
Maria I want to be puttin' that thing on your daughter
Gambino brings the sushi, they doin' John Belushi
So stupid but they cutie so sue me if I get booty
That's Louis, Gucci or Prada, Bugatti bitches who holla
Wanna take Foxy out but I gotta be gettin' Donnas,
"I'm an artist man." No y'all ain't!
Man fuck Photoshop, I'm in MS Paint!
Making circles with that circle thing, Gambino boy you murdering
Now I got this afro those cornrows were fuckin' hurting me
I like my face when I'm under you
Screen Actors Guild with a "W," swag
