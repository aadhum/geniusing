I'm blowin' up like my swagga on the Gaza
I'm writin' movies where I'm makin' out with Aubrey Plaza
And home girl, my home girl
It is not like that
And if you tried to rape me
I would not fight back
Girls that turn me down are saying "please," and "sorry"
You lucky that I'm randy
So now I'm in the club
Tellin' strippers to back it up
It's funny how these niggas all treat me like we're best friends
I wanna fuck these small girls, minus S-M
It's going down like my living room elevator
Fuck what you heard bitch, I'll fuck your fuckin' brains out
And maybe watch your boyfriend cheese to get the stains out
Put your fucking boots on, it's time to kick the lanes out
I'm a genius and I ain't try to hide it neither
Got a lot of hate, let me pay for what you sip tonight
Mixed girls from Williamsburg, that's my fucking kryptonite
have it however you want it
Whatever you asking 'bout, I promise you that I've done it
My swag is New York, but my home is the South
But it's amazing how I eat more pussy than Alf
