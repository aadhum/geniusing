sho
imagine different things
that seems highly unlikely
“Yaphet Kotto” album teaser
Maybe the track was supposed to be on the album?
we’re told that THE BOY loves to troll people on the internet
Donald is playing THE BOY
the album
script through the internet
outside of this “world”
maybe we are a part of the world too
They ain’t his name
box
just another thought he had
after-life
he has just been chilling here the whole time
The tracklist found on the physical copy of the album reads “life: the biggest troll [andrew auernheimer] feat. Donald Glover”
Is there a switch between Donald Glover and Childish Gambino on the track?
Is this THE BOY asking for help?
Maybe it’s just Donald/Gambino asking someone for help
