Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for a boy like that to go wrong
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin' (Oooh)
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now don't you close your eyes
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm trying not to waste my time
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin'
Put your hands up on me
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke
Niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke
Niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
But stay woke
But stay woke
