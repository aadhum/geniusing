[Hook: Cutty]
What it is ho, what's up
Can a nigga get in them guts
Cut you up like you ain't been cut
Show your ass how to really catch a nut
Well give me you number and I'll call
And I'll follow that ass in the mall
Take you home, let you juggle my balls
While I'm beating and tearing down your walls
[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
This your boy Mr. Funkadelic
what's the business baby
I've been eyeing you all day in the mall miss lady
I think I seen your ass in the hood
With your friends dressed up, trying to front if you could
But anyway, gone and drop a number or something
So I can call you later on,on your phone or something
Take you home, and maybe we could bone or something
It's no limits to what we do, cause tonight we cutting,
gut busting
I'm digging in your walls something viscious
With your legs to the ceiling, catch a nut someting serious
You delirious,
or might I say you taste so delicious
With your pretty brown skin, like almond joys and kisses
And you ah certified head doctor
Number one staller that takes dick in the ass and won't holler
Where it goes down lovely in the Legion of Doom
[Verse 2: Lil LA]
Shit, you know the deal before a nigga even stepped
You know I give it to you til you run out of breath
I met your ass at the mall, in the fall
You the one with the dress on, let me take you home
you got me right
[Verse 3]
Cause you the one, a nigga met at south dekalb mall
While I lay this dick down on you just like I'm Teddy
