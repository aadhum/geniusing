I ain't playing nann day
Prove a nigga what you say
Get some rank, bitch
Time after time I ask myself
Is it really clever for you to get with me?
I got that chrome
Most these niggas playing chief will put you straight to the test
Look at my Benz, look at my Ac'
Look at my Navi' and my 'Lac
I knew you wasn't real cause all ya do is chit-chat
Always slizzle-making
Call us some broad to the Georgia Dome
Trying to get with me is like naps through a comb
Don P aka "Corleone"
Don't know if I'm high, drunk, or getting my roll on
He on the cell "Can ya hear me?"
get up on my level, ho!
Trillville, ATL swanging, swanging, throwing bows
We ain't hard to find, nigga, so why you steadily talking shit?
Don't touch my Kangol, shorty... what's wrong with you?
