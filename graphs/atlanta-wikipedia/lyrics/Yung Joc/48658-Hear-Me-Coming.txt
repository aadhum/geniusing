Y'all already know me you ain't even gotta wonder
I was voted number one rapper to drop this summer
A one hit wonder, how the hell ya figure that?
My rhymes like crack, fiends screamin gimme dat
Got a bitch named Judy with a real big booty
Boost all day, keep a nigga ridin Coogi
If it's a problem I suggest you let it go
Got some killers over there on Headland and Delowe
My niggas wet niggas , yo' niggas get drenched
My niggas take the coke, and let the shit cook
Yo' niggas experiment with the dope and get hooked
