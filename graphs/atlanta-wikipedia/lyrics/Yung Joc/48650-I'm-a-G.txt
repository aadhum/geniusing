I'm the seventh letter of the alphabet (I'm a G)
And in my pocket it ain't ever nuttin less (than a G)
The block on lock, just like the chain gang
The Hustlenomic$ piece back and forth when the chain swang
grandaddy
'77 Chevelle, same color cocaine
Pull up on the scene, bitch I'm cleaner than chlorine
Block star comin, I'm proud of sellin codeine
Shoot a nigga ER from off the street, no beam
All I want is some mo' cream, my wrist on Jack Frost
Tell 'em again they see it man my wrist on Jack Frost
I ain't gotta say how much the motherfuckin Vette cost
Thirty inches touchin on the Escalade, 'llac cost
Catch me up on Section Road, tearin up the asphault
Took a lot if cash and bought, jewelry, 'scuse me
Swingin on them niggas swear I gotta feel some fury
Trappin at the hotel you can catch me at the jewelry
A general, I'm surely, man I'm sittin pretty
You see my toolery it's bigger than your arm so
No tomfoolery and you won't see the bomb blow
Need a bomb ho, Yung Joc got the work
I need some bomb 'dro, "Best Thang Smokin'" got the purp'
bombay
Who, you know who's keepin it trilla
Just name any thug, gangster, soldier, or gorilla
I snatch him up by his shoulders and strip off his stripes
Cause when you trill you don't trip off the height, that ain't my type
