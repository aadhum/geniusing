This a nitty beat (boing)
Here we go again
Ghettoville U.S.A. (uh Oh)
You know I go by the name Nitti right
I gotta introduce you to another motherfucker out my squad right (who dis nigga mane)
Dis nigga go by the name of joc (joc?)
He resides in collegepark (collegepark cp)
Niggas in my face
Damn near er' day
Askin a million questions like
Joc where ya stay
Tell 'em collegepark
Where they chop cars
In 20 grand spend a grand at the bar
Beat in my trunk ballin just for the freaks
Boys from the hood call me black Donald Trump
Have ya every seen a Chevy wit the butterfly doors?
