I walk in my garage (yeah boy)
I got a lot of choices (yeah boy)
Should I ride the Benz
Or should I ride the Porsche
Ima ride the slab, cause it match my Air Forces
I need to build a stable, to hold all of my horses (yeah boy)
I can't hear the music, the pipe's too noisy
This is how it feels ridin' 500 horses
Five hundred horses, that's a stampede
Pullin' off the lot lookin' like I push big block
'69 Camaro 396 big block
All original interior I like my shit stock
Porsche truck super sport, take it to my partner's house
Harley Davidson truck pullin' up I got the right of way
I walk in my garage, I got a lot of choices
Should I ride the Benz, or should I ride the Porsche?
Ima ride the slab, cause it match my Air Forces
I need to build a stable to hold all of my horses
I can't hear the music, the pipe's too noisy
This is how it feels ridin' 500 horses
Where your top go? Man I had to get rid of her
Take your shoes off baby doll before you sit in here
Boom, then we gone, bout 150 m-p-h
Pullin out the old school, just so I can see 'em hate
Runnin through the city lights, watchin' for the city cops
Could've had the 'maro but I'm always in the Challengers
10 stacks to race, do I have any challengers?
You can tell them little ponies I got 500 horses
And when it come to hoes I got like 500 choices
beat turned up loud
Lean in my cup
Hit the club racked up, I might just buy the bar
Turbo twin pipe, hit the gas I'm on that fast shit
Old schools, new schools, Lambos, Porsches
