Catch me on yo' block with 4 Glocks and 4 shots
Bet you niggas know not, try me like a ho not
Niggas run in, kick the do', fuck a do' knock
I chop the dope and sell it with the Razor Motorola
Bring your own beer to the party - aight~!
Bring your own beer to the party - aight~!
Bring your own beer to the party motherfuckers
Cause I heard you came to have a good time - aight~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - ah let's go~!
Alright, alright, alright, alright - let's go motherfucker!
Yeahhhhhhhh
Yung Joc so jiggy, Lear Jet to yo' city
I like my chick booty big-o, lay my head on them big ole's
I don't wine them, dine them, or rest have 'em
I'm the #1 playboy, I press play and
Lighter to the ceiling, grab a beer, pop the top boi
Elders say "Oh dear" when they hear I'm near
Rubber burn first gear, platinum on my first year
Wood on my sheer, put my wood all in her grill
Roof on fire, sound the alarm
We don't need water (let the motherfucker burn)
R-2-D-2
Let me see your robot, a little dance that we do
On cloud 9 - heart racin like Corvette
I need a material girl in a material world
Hold up, stop, it hurts when you twist it
