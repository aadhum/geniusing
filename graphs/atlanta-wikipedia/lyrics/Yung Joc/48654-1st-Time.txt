It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shawty, best beware
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
It ain't nothing like the first time
I'm tryna tell you I can blow your mind
Baby, if I touch you here and kiss you there
Gonna fall in love, shorty, best beware
