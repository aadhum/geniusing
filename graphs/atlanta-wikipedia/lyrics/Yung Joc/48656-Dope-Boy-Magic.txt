How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
Watch me work them plays like that 95 Madden
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
I get it nine in the mornin by night it just plastic
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
I'm fresh ta death everyday like I jumped up out a casket
How you do that I call it Dope Boy Magic
Seven grams of presidental blowin in the wind
At 4 A.M.the eight at nine touchdown a beautiful play
In my neighborhood so what now
