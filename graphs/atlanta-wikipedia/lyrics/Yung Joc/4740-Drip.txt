Yeah, I bust your head gasket, leave you with a oil drip
2 Glocks like 2Pac, I’m on my thug immortal shit
Chrome with the pearly
Shoot ya bitch in the throat leave her voice raspy
Soo woo to the bee-hive,
strapped like T.I
I keep that bitch on me, like the Book of Eli
Cause bitch, I’m all about my paper, like Usher
I know Chris, decepticon clips transform ya
My piece of the pie, ha ha ha, Digorno
I put bullet holes in everything except the car seat
