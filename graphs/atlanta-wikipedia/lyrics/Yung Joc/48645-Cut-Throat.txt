That nigga Quik produced this shit?
My niggas cutthroat, my niggas cutthroat
I got some killas on the East and the West Coast
Dead prez on your head, get up ho
Uh get up ho, uh get up ho
My niggas cutthroat, my niggas cutthroat
I got some killas on the East and the West Coast
They whip game real good, they got the best dope
Uh get up ho, uh get up ho
Original Bad Boys, nigga even Puff' know
We ain't mad about Pac, we know who did it
We just mad that him and Big' got crossed in '9-sizix
Hey, nigga you don't want no static
Holes through your chest, hard to breathe like asthmatics
I fuck with real G's, like The Diplomats
Chirp my nigga J. Taylor on the Boost Mobile
Either you slang crack rock or you had that wicked jumpshot
Either or, there was no in between
It was either be poor or move coke to the fiends
