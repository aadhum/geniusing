So I'm outside of da club and you think I'm a puuuuuuuunk

Who am I???
Bone Crusher, motherfucker!
AttenCHUUUUUUUUN!!!
Check my resume nigga, I got that one hitta quitta
And yo boys ready to flee like "Why'd you fuck with that nigga?!?!
I tell her front (front), back (back), side to side
Never let a punk ass nigga slide, dawg
You get beat dead, that means you dead meat

That's courage and brain,
Not from Houston, but shit, call me Lil' Flip
Cuz I flip a little, fa shizzle, you flippin' nickels

No basketball, when we talkin', run and shoot
No matter what county I'm in, Dekalb, Cobb, Fulton or Clayton

If the world was sucka free, it just be me and my niggas left
I ain't neva scared, I got big hammers everywhere
In places where you need yo passport at, I'm heavy there
Like a new single, make sure you leak for a month
like a Harley pick up

Cuz I don't care if you live or phony, cuz we ain't NEVA SCARED!
Layin' stiffer than frozen food
