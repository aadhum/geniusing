(?) this
With so much love why do we need hate
Cuz everybody plate ain't full, we got some empty plates
Gotta grind till they give you yo' shine, you shake and bake like
And I keep a box of extra clips
Cuz haterism is a trip
And I come out the +blue+ like a Crip
And believe me asses'll get whipped
My new born gon' drink milk from his momma's breast
We comin up like escalators
