Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhh! Ohhh!
All the shorties in the club (let me see you just)
Back it up, drop it down (let me see you just)
Get low and scrub the ground (let me see you just)
Push it up, push it up (let me see you just)
I got 'em shakin they boobies like congos
Man I'm shakin the city like quakes
The haters blue in the face, like Gonzo
cake
Y'all new to the game but y'all might wanna
Save ya whack raps, daylight saving time (time)
A girl told me that a man that could dance
Might could possibly get down with the tool in his pants
Now all my ladies let me see you vibrate
And when it's over you ain't gon' need ya vibrator
Cause I'm a pro, make you bend your back low
Then I pound it real fast just like the perculator
Girl wobble it (yesss) and I'mma gobble it
Boy got a gift like it gotta be Christmas
Swag don't miss like he gotta be gifted
Cause I leave ya holy like you pray in the temple
Want beef?
I move with the led of a pencil
