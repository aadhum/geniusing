(Soulja Boy tell 'em!)
twistin up a Phillie
Get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY)
Get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY)
* Get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY) get silly (HEY)
Cause you can't put a rubberband around a bill-ion
Drillin hoes like a dentist then then then I fill her in
My shades too silly cause they made by cavalli
I'm not Nick Cannon but I'm "Wild'n Out" clubbin
That's all y'all got! (That's all they got)
Y'all ain't even fightin back man
First Hurricane, then Soulja Boy
Then the African prince of Collipark, V.I.C. yup!
