Baby I know its love,cause everything fits just fine
You don't give it up, cause you got hot on the very first
Night
I could be the one, who, can change your life and do it right
Away
Baby let me prove it to you
Anything that you might need, Realize (realize) that Im right
Here
Baby tell me that you won't leave, Realize (realize) that Im
Right here
Its something else, when I think of all the times we've had
And all those memories, no I wouldn't trade 'em for nothin' I
Have
