I'm rolling down a lonely highway
Asking god to please forgive me
For messing up the blessing he gave to me, I see,everything clearer now
The nights is black as, black as its ever been
I pray that he would just shed his grace on me
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey yea yea
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
back
See my mama told me that's if its meant to be
She'll come back and she'll forgive me
I know, I don't wanna do it
But if I continue to push she'll just pull away
