Stunt [x4]
Stacks on Deck
Everywhere I go, people lookin at me like
Damn that boy cashed up
Damn that boy swagged up
Everywhere I be, people lookin at me like
Damn that boy cashed up
Damn that boy swagged up
Girls lookin at me, lookin really fancy
Oh you so cutie, oh I'm so pretty
Oh I'm in Ferrari, I don't have to say sorry
Honest lil Dre, old school no atari
Pulled off of the club, in a drop top phantom
Ham savage shawty with a muthafuckin tool
Young Soulja Boy make the trap go ham
500K, Mr. Digital Dash
Digital digital, everything digital
Scarface mansions, that's how we live
Red bentley bitch, call that shit fire flame
VIP monday night, making it damn rain
