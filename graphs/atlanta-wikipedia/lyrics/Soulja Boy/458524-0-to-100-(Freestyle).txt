0 to 100 nigga real quick
I rock Louis V. shit, I don't rock Hilfiger
Six million on that once, one on my wrist
Ridin' through the hood, Ace of Spades, bottle of the Cris'
Rollie on my wrist, drunk piss, yellow diamond shit
Rich Gang in this bitch, tell a nigga dip
I be pourin' up drank, I be sippin' lean
Shout out to Rich Gang, nigga that's my team
S.O.D. Gang got your bitch and she flexin'
S.O.D. ball every night like Gladys
The same day I got "Rich Gang" tatted made a mill
Third album drop 100k, that's a mill silly
Bentley two hundred fifty bands, they alarming... Niggas all on me
This is not a diss song, this is just a warning
Walkin' 'round, untouchable there's no harming
Billboard Charts I'm Number 1
AK-47 make a nigga take a swim, gone
And Birdman told me get 'em, he know that I'm a vet
I need my momma to have more money than me
I need my daddy to have more money than me
I need my kids to have more money than me
My nigga Boosie home, man I'm goin' crazy
