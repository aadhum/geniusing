Riding down my hood, in that yellow crown vet
All my niggas know that I got the Benz
Ridin' through my trap
Making it look so damn easy
My pockets looking lovely
Niggas on that paper chase
Caked up Soulja Boy, all about that grape swisher
I broke it down
Nigga up in my town we gettin' HIGH
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em with that lean in my cup
Bustin at me, he's a bitch so I hit the po
Them niggas want to see you down when you doing good
Got a million in the bank, well that's all good
They want to see you fall, they want to bust your ass
In my hood, ain't no love for your snitch ass
Nigga keep your mouth closed about that business
In the mothafuckin street, nigga please pay attention
You knowin where I'm at
Basefield, Mississippi
