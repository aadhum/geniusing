I got what you need, trap boy Soulja
In that white cocaine Benz like its baking soda
I've been flipping bricks, got it 'cross the border
M16 hollow tips hit his shoulder
He thought I was playing, unloaded hella clips
Hot yellow bitch, and she sucking dick
And the next day a shoot out with the fuckin' 4
So I had to drop my top and I was gone
All that mothafuckin' cheddar I had like sixty on
