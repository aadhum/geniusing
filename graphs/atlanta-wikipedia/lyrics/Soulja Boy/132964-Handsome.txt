One day I'm in the trap, next day in the mansion
No Chris Brown but my diamonds dancing
And I'm ridin foreign and my shoes Michael Jordan
Zan Zan, Lean Jammin
Ain't DJ Khaled but I'm the best
400 horses when I'm pullin up flexin
400 polo ralph lauren when I'm flexin
2 M's like I won wheel of fortune
And I shot my gun
And that shit was fun
And I set my zone in every song
Made a beat for Tunechi song
