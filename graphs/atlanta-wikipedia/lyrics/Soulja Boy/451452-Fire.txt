I got the streets on fire (8x)
Chain cost like nine
I get money all the time
I ain't even in my prime
I'm rolling with a dime
I got money on my mind
Money all the time yeah money on the streets, though
East coast west coast south side I go beast mode
Shoot your pussy ass up like a free throw
You see like everywhere I go they know my name
I Got the streets on fire walking in flames
2016 SB bringing pain
I'm in the 'gatti and I'm swerving switching lanes
Fifty ? on my chain
I'm an animal can't detain
