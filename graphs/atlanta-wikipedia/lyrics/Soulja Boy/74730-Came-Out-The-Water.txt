goons
Every mixtape that I drop going platinum
Lay her on that mattress then i blow her back bitch
AK 47 make your ass do a backflip
Young Soulja Boy, I'mma boss til' the end shit
Black girl white girl gone take your order
If you ain't talking money then it's not important
Oh I'm so handsome poppin out the Phantom
'Lil Dre a.k.a Soulja boy tell em
Came out the water like a six time felon
Gone cross the water, I walk like I'm Jesus
It's yellow diamond Beezy made that shit look easy
Niggas living wrong but my life is so perfect
