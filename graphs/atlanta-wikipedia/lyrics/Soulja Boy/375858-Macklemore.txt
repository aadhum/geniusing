I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
Got a lot of money, it's coming through the door
I got a hundred bands on the floor
I got Louie V, and I got Michael Kors
I'm getting money like I'm Macklemore
I got a hundred bands, coming straight through the door
I got money all across the floor
versace trench coats
Michael Kors
I be riding in that foreign whip
Hop up in the whip, I'm walking in the whip
Thirty bands and that's on my hip
I keep a couple bad bitches, I make them strip
I'm getting bands like I'm Barack Obama
I did had the game locked for like six summers
I got a dirty gun in that hummer, and your girl want me to ask for her number
We make it rain when we hit the club
My rims so big, it make my tires scrub
I got a Bentley, I park it in my house
I got a big whip, hanging all out
I do 360
we going fucking ham
I got a fucking bad bitch, we got a lot money
I got a lot of fuck niggas, they be hating on me
