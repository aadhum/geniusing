I'm in the booth with marijuana eyes
Uh, Soulja Boy Tellem, uh
I love females who like to wear their toes out
Call me a fire hydrants, I bring them hoes out
I got a lot of people want whats
hanging from neck
Call me what you want, just don?t call me collect
Save your lame game for your muthafucking memory cards
I want the money
Money and the cars
Cars and the clothes
The hoes
I suppose
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be
I just wanna be successful
Hip Hop is like school yeah I had to learn it
I'm heading to the finish line ain't got no time for U-turns
You fall down seven times you stand up eight
Realize true happiness lies inside of you
The birds sing after the muthafucking storm gone
Theres a 95% chance that it used to be your ringtone
Heart tatted in my neck they love my vocals
spit this crack
I leak it on the internet and watch my haters react
said they can't read between the lines
So I jab uppercut punch line after punch line
Know your thinking damn Soulja going hard right now
And I'm thinking damn, this is just a star right now
Soulja Boy is gone on the renegade
If life give you lemons make lemonade
Uh, no one person on this earth can change their past
But every single person on this earth can start today
And change their future
