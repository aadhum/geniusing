Turn my swag on!
Count so much money every day is gettin' my arms swole
My swag is outer space
similar to a wormhole
Dunkin' on the game like Stephon Marbury
Rappers on tour but, they ridin' a Grayhound!
I'm Louie V down, like a Louie V chameleon
Long hair, don't care,
holla back, bitch
I'm the shit and you, you just a maggot on a tissue
Better tell 'em I'm hotter than a Arizona missile
White Benz, chrome wheels
Black card boy, make ya throw away that Visa baby
You ain't on the planet I'm on
and I never leave my swagger at home
