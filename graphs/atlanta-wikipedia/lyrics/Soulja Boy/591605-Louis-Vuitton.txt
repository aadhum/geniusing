Soulja, swagger, Louis
I came out the water
L.V. shades on
Twenty K, racked up
Walk inside Lenox Mall
Cause I'm stackin'
Everybody wanna know
What the fuck is happenin'
Money going platinum
Sold out shows
Across the globe
Got me happy
AK, automatic
All she keeps screamin' is
"Louis Vuitton"
Throwin' all these hundreds
I don't fuck with the ones
2012 Bentley
Cellphone flip
L.V. pants with that L.V. sag
It don't make no sense
Why these niggas hate
It don't make no sense
Why they L.V. fake
When mine's real
And they say
That boy is doin' his thing
Doin' his thang
Dooin' his thaaaang
Swag
