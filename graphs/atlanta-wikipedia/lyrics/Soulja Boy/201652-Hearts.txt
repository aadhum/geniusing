Yo, every fucking song I do is like magic now
Alright, SOD, I got you
I was chilling on Tumblr
Bad yellow bone says she want slumber party
Said she wanna slumber
I was chilling in my 2-4 seater
This what I do
I’ma get up on this beater
And eat her
Shawty hit me up on Twitter
And a DM
Says she wanna see me, I’m like damn
But I know I’ll be on TV looking like damn
I be riding through in a Bentley
Nigga can you picture that?
Back in the days, I ain’t had no money, had no money
But now these days, I got a lot a of money
I got a lot of money, I got a lot of money
