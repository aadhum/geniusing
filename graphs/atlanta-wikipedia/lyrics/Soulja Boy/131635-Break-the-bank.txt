I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)
I’m tryn’ to break the bank fuck you niggas think
Pull up in that Bentley customize the paint
Lean in the sink I’m doing what you can’t
put that 9 in your face
50 thousand dollars made my lawyer beat the case
I ain’t got no suit, but I got a suitcase
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)
Who really can do it like me in the streets we’re 50 Cents
In the studio with Lil Twist
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (8x)
Walk inside that bitch 500k cash
Walk about that bitch I need a million dollars cash
I’m tryin’ to break the bank (4x)
