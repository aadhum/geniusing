Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
Goddamn money, for my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
For goddamn money, for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money money money
For my goddamn..
Been down the block, going crazy for my goddamn money
In the kitchen whippin' up a hundred yams
Strip club, I done bust a hundred bands
Stacks on deck, hell yea we in demand
Pull up in the Porsche and we had the diggi dash that
Young Dre,
Yellow diamonds shawty,
20 bottles later I'm on the pool table
Pull up and we flexin', yea yea we flexin'
But I've been down the block in the Maserati flexing
