Man I just got my report card today mayne
I looked at it man I had all F's on it
I took it back to the teacher and told her throw some D's on it
LIKE THAT! Soulja Boy up in the building (throw some D's on that-on that)
I just got my report card (throw some D's on that-on that)
I just got my report card (throw some D's on that-on that)
Soulja Boy chillin dog, just got my report card
Looked at it, all F's,
took it to the teacher desk
Sittin up in the classroom, she gettin on my nerves
The teacher talin 'bout, "Soulja Boy do yo' work"
I got my 'port card, I'm like what the hell is this
I took it back to the teacher and then I told her
Soulja Boy chillin dog, just got my report card
Looked at it, all F's,
took it to the teacher desk
[Verse Two: Arab]
I get into some trouble then my momma calls
Soulja Boy chillin dog, just got my report card
Looked at it, all F's,
took it to the teacher desk
