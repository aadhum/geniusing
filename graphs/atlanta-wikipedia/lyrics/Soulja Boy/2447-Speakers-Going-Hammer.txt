I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
(Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up
dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
speakers going hammer
bammer-bammer-bammer
My speakers out of space like ET
Cops watch me all day like TV
SOD hit the club, we be so deep
Mayne I'm deep in the game
I grind like a OG
I got 12 diamond chains like a OZ
Follow me like the Wizard of Oz
Girls love my style cause it is so neat
Ask about me in the streets I spit so heat
Ain’t nobody in the game messing with my click
Style swift hot like it’s July 10th
Fly chick in my whip with nice tits
Her boyfriend paid for it, I didn’t
Ice game, cold as a polar bear
Sun hit my chain, watch it make a solar flare
Y'all making it too easy, it’s not fair
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
(Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up
dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
speakers going hammer
bammer-bammer-bammer
I remember back in the days, mayne I was broke
These days Soulja Tell 'Em run a hundred spokes
I’m balling out the atmosphere
Say you ball harder then me, man get 'em outta here
I gotta my speakers going ham
in my Lamborghini
Passenger seat and she five star she so swag
She so Fabolous, they way she throw it in the bag
I’m popping tags
Back then, you could catch me in a Pontiac
These days drop top Phantom
with a 100 stacks
Yeah they buy this album but they want they money back
Girls wet like they living in a fish tank
Young Soulja got my speakers going MC Hammer
Like Rick Ross bitch I think I’m MC Hammer
I wake up early in the morning 'round the crack of dawning
Wave to my neighbors like what's up?
(Say what's up?)
And I’m all tatted up
dat bang in my trunk
Everybody in ma city show me love
speakers going hammer
bammer-bammer-bammer
