Smoking presidential
My weed is elected
In the hood nigga section
You girl is my food
I had her for breakfast
I left that bitch breathless
This is not school
So please do not test this
Your girl sucked on my dick
And it felt like she had no teeth
In hip-hop I go ham
Now let's have a feast man
If you feel like a frog
Than go ahead and leap man
I'm on my green shit
My football field team shit
I got bars, I got cars
I got hors I'm a star
I got mars on my side
The aliens are down to ride
Me and you are the same, really, sike!
all the facts
Stuntin through your city
You can never see me
'Less your looking through a TV
I stay on the hustle like T.I
So free Tip
Take off, my brim
Moment of Silence for my boy
Dolla Bill
I' back on this track
Like the white chick on Superman
Think I'm dong hair
The way I'm popping these rubberbands
Stackz On Deck standing Taller than a rubberman
Fucking with a rat boy
Call him ninja turtle man
Messing with my money
Get jacked up like Urkel's pants
Reppin' for the cat like
Allison in Wonderland
