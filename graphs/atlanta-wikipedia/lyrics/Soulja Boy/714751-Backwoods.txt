I'm rollin' up these Backwoods
I'm ridin' through my damn hood
Damn, Soulja, you eatin' good
Ride through the city and I got the strap
Lamborghini and I painted it black
Uzi automatic my favorite strap
Ice and Ferragamo, my cuban link
Niggas be talking, they don't get no cheddar
VVS diamonds is all in my bezel
Used to live in a bando
Niggas talkin', they get no money
I be seein' my face through the channels
I'm lightin' shit up like a candle
