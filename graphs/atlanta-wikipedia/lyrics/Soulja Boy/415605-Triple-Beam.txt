How I get the guap? It's a mystery, disrespect my squad I'm a leave you history
Pull up on your block, know I'm getting money I put in your face
I reach in my pockets and see all my Franklin's
Walk in the mall Versace my draws, and all of the girls they fainting man
Pull up to the club in a car you never seen
50k stuffed inside my Robin Jeans

Smoking kush walking in the bank
