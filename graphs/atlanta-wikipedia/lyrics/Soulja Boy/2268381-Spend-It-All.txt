You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
Had to cop a Phantom, had to hop out, damn I won a Grammy
Had to spend 3 million on my mansion
Had to buy my bitch Versace panties
I call my jeweler
Slick Rick the ruler
Ferragamo phinney chain
You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
Hop inside my Phantom, seats reclining
I just made a hundred, I can't find em
And you know I do it, turn a Monday to Tuesday
she wanted my number
Gave her the wrong number,
these niggas is one hit wonders
You already know I'ma ball, money it be sittin' tall
Lean like a waterfall, ball until I fall
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
I'ma spend it all, I'ma spend it all
