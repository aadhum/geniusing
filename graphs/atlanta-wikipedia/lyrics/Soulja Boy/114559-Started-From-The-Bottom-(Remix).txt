I'm on a jet getting head in the sky
Shoot me in my face if I ever tell a lie nigga
I be on my grind you know why
I need a million dollars and my face is seeing dollar signs nigga
Soulja Boy stay up on his grind
Hustle Everday man I do this all the time nigga
Y'all ain't even seeing what I saw
A 100k in diamonds had chopped up raw
I said
Y'all ain't getting money
Y'all ain't getting stacks
Fuck 100k where ya millions at?
Y'all ain't getting money
Y'all ain't getting stacks
Fuck 100k where ya millions at?
