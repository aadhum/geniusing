Black cars black cars I'm so legendary
Black beautiful girls put they numbers in my Blackberry
Souljaboytellem yea that's my name
All black diamonds in my Lamborghini chain
Black and white mix man I'm feeling like Obama
All I'm black everything man I try to warn them
Check out my grill...George Foreman
How do I do it man? nobody knows
