Runnin With It. Gotta Get A Black Mask
Can't See Me, SouljaBoyTellEm
Im On The Beat.
Did Yo City Release, Yet, Nope, Don't Think So
Still Reppin West Side Till I Go
Cicero Roll
When you Use To Post Up At The Green Sto'
Waitin For Da Marta
I Ain't Have A Car Yet, Lookin For Da Charger, Bout To Jump A Rail
Me And My Niggas, We Crunk As Hell
Shot Out To My Nigga Antonio. Ima Holla At U Folk
Got Them Goons Holdin Dat Scope
On Patrol.
H2 Hummer, With The 8's Sitten Tall
Me And My Niggas We Gotta Ball
Made It Rain In Da Mall. In Da Mall In New York
Get It Man
Get It Man, Know I'm Bout Da Business Man
Leavin All Wit It Man, 50
In A Minute Man
Get It Man
Get It Man
Know I Gotta Get It Man
S.O.D Till Da Day I Go
6-6-Duece-G-D-74
I Was Born, Back In 19-9-0
Killin' This Shit, Make It Look So Easy
My Wrist Look Freezy
My Jewels Look Cheesy
Talkin Bout The Fight Show
6-Niggas Then Ran In My Crib
Ak's, And Pistols And Shit
For What? All Over A Motha Fuckin Chain
Niggas Trying To Kill Me
Kid-Nap My Nigga
But It's All Good Though
I Thought I'll Never Have To Shoot A MuthaFucka
Good Thang I Was Strapped Though
