(The flyest on the planet Earth)
Man I'm posed with the Polo shirt
G5 so fly
Man it's me young Beezy I'm on that grind
Yeah it's S Beezy my time to shine
Yeah 2010 yeah that's my year
2011 yeah that's my year
2012 13 and 14 and 15
16, 17, yeah 18 I'm here
Back to the wall and I still fight back
I tell my young boys that I got that back
Word to the world like a gift like Claus
Put my hand on the bible put a verse to God
Treat a hater like a pistol then I go and erase him
One thing that I know I can face anything
Young Soulja TellEm let my fuckin jewelry bling
See me on the TV screen I'm doin things
I'm tellin f'real this not just hype
I'm tellin you everything I spit is real
I'm tellin you man, fuck how you feel
Livin and seein through my eyes (when I be so...)
Every day, is a different chapter (when I be so high)
(When I be so fly, when I be)
Every day is a different page in my book
I call it life (flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth)
(The flyest on the planet Earth, I'm up in the clouds)
(I be so fresh to death, I be so fresh to death)
Right now I'm to a cloud
(I be so fresh to death, yeah I'm the sky)
Y'know I'm lovin what I do
(I'm in the sky right now, I'm in the sky right now)
(I'm in the sky right now and I'm not comin down)
Amazing, this a dream one good dream
(Most dreams just fade away, grow wings and I fly away)
(Both spread and I fly away, wings spread and I fly away)
Life, Dre, y'know
Just doin my lil' thang
