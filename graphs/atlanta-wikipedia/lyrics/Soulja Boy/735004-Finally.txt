On a private jet while I'm going up
And it make no sense how I be pouring up
All of my niggas know I keep the Double cup
Trapping 30 pounds of migit
Man I'm doing this shit for my niggas
My niggas pull triggers
My niggas they working them figures
My niggas moving putting niggas in ditches
My niggas trapping we came straight from the trenches
Niggas mad I got bitches switching in positions
Diamonds up in different dimensions
Trapping capping nigga can't you tell
Pulling up in that new ghost and I scare ya
I got the kilos and Iggy Azalea
Making it rain yeah I change the weather
Soulja Boy Tell'em head hancho
My grand daddy he got the bricks from
????
I finesse the plug from Pablo
I took 20 million and ran as fast as I could wells Fargo
