(Zaytoven)
Zaytoven where ya at, uh
Big Soulja where ya at, uh
Pull up to the club ten chains on my neck
Riding round town and I'm sitting in a 'Vette
Got a lot of money yeah I got a lot of checks
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
All I do is flex, yeah all I do is flex
Yeah I'm King Soulja, hey, how ya doing?
Ten chains on my neck with some Patrick Ewing's
I be fresh as fuck when I'm on the red carpet
Smoking on this kush taking off like a rocket
Pretty boy swag but I still got pounds
Aye, I'm on tour, selling out the shows
Smoking on this kush, fucking all these hoes
Pouring up this lean and you know just how it goes
Soulja boy been telling em man I be rocking gold
Took over the world and Imma take over the next
Flex, big Soulja boy I want another check, ah
