I told the dumb bitch I dropped close to a quarter mil on the motherfucking vehicles
Yellow chain on me, nigga I swag you already know
Came in this ocean gang, we might splash on your ho
Word around town my last whip cost 8 figures
Bitch I got swag for sale
Black jag, yellow bone in the passenger, I damage her
Paper x6
Man we getting paper
Paper x6
All about that paper
Everyday I'm getting money came out the water like an anaconda
Close enough to Soulja
All my jewelry is so frozen,
