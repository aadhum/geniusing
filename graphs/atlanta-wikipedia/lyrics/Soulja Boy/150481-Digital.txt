I'm fresh forever
Can I get a witness
You the type to live under a rock, Patrick Star
Feeling serena
I'm ahead of this music game by light years
Im the definition of swag bitch it's right here
I'm gutta gutta just like YM signed me
I'm the sun in the summer, you can't outshine me
Bitch look at my dashboard, I bet that bitch digital
They saying damn
Song stucked in they head
Pussy nigga I got the game locked just like a dread
I'm 19 now
With 19 million
Back then it was all a dream
These days I'm feeling like martin luther king
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
My chain turns colors
I call it chameleon
Call her girlfriends over
We watching her eat it
And nigga im the best bitch and I fucking mean it
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty check the dashboard in my lambo and it's digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
Digital digital everything digital
Digital digital everything digital
Shorty look at my dash and I bet that thing digital
Shorty look at my watch and I bet that thing digital
