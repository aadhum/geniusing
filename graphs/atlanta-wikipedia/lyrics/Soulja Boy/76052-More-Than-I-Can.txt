Countin' up 2million dollars cash right now
I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly
I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought
I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke
I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought
I'm talking Lambo's, Hummer Trucks, Bentleys and all of that
Pulling up Mercades at the parting jet
Two mill off a tour somebody get em
Everyday we hustle and we hustle hard
You ain't got the check put it on a fucking card
Mixtape dropped and its downloaded
Lil' Dre everything on me frozen
20 karats Bugs Bunny mad at me
10 chain 5 ring the swag daddy
I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought
I got million dollar thoughts
You can hear it in my voice dog
Hear it in my raps
You can hear it in my chorus dog
Panamera Porsche dog
Everbody looking at me
And I ain't ever going back
Made it out my situation
Now Im smoking loud pack
Come in to my mansion
I got cash to the cealing
Tatted up my whole chest
I got more hoes than I can fuck
Got more cars than I can drive
More clothes than I can wear
More jets than I can fly

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought

I got more jewelery than I can rock
More kush than I can smoke
More lean than I can drink
I ain't ever going broke

I ain't ever seen a drought
I ain't ever seen a drought
I swear to god dog, I ain't ever seen a drought
