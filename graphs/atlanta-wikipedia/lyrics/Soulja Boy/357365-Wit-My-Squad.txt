Young Soulja Boy, I keep the money and the strap
Kick up in yo' crip, bitch I'm looking for where you at
Heard he got them pounds and the bricks, bitch where they at
Hundred bricks in, I can do this shit like Tony
Nigga disrespect, man these niggas so phony
AK47 leave a pussy by his lonely
Disrespect my team then you know I'm sending shots
Come in through that Veneno and then I drop the top
Wake up in the morning and then you know I whip the pot
PA, m2thaK them niggas riding with me
Damn it's a good day, my watch it cost 100K
Early in the morning, I'm on the phone trapping
The bitches tryna to set me up, you know I can't trust 'em
