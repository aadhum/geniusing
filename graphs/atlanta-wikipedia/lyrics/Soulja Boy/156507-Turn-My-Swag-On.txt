Soulja Boy tell 'em
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
Turn my swag on
It's my turn, now turn it up
Yeah, yeah
I put my team on, then my theme song
Now it's time to turn it up
I got a question, why they hatin' on me
I got a question, why they hatin' on me
I ain't did nothin' to 'em, but count this money
When I was nine years old
I put it in my head that I'm gonna die for this gold
Soulja Boy tell 'em
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
I'm back again
I know a lot of you all thought I wasn't comin' back
Yeah, yeah
I had to prove 'em wrong
Got back in the studio and came up with another hit
I told the world my story
The world where I'm from, souljaboyXL.com
Now every time you see me spit
Every time you hear me rhyme
Every time you see me in your state or town, say what's up
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror,
said what's up
I'm gettin' money,
oh
