When I get you to that bed, me and you gon' turn up
Just like that candlelight, me and you gon' burn up
And if you know you lookin' good baby smile, baby smile
'Cause you ain't have none that good in a while
I just wanna change yo life, and show you some thangs
That you have never seen and take you to places you never been
Befo', yeah here we go
I swear you on my mind, all the time
And if you know you lookin' good baby smile, baby smile
'Cause you ain't have none that good in a while
And if you know you lookin' good baby smile, baby smile
'Cause you ain't have none that good in a while
