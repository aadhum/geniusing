Jumping off the roof
God damn, where's my parachute?
Pretty boy goons
All we know is money and the loot
40 on my troop
80 drop top, I'm on the loose
Fuck the F.B.I. and fuck all the Army troops
Fighting for what, bitch? Be your own man
I be flying through the clouds
With green like I'm Peter Pan
I just talked to God today
I said "Give me another chance!"
So I'm back in the hood
And I'm trying to flip the bands
I done put the double cup
And pulled up the kickstand
Now the hoes on my dick
Cause the tats on my hands
And my hand gripping wheel
Behind the 2012 van
And my goons duffled up
Got the bricks and the kush
Everybody on me
Cause the album just dropped
Mane, the Juice mixtape
Got the hood on fire
I'mma keep hitting licks
Til my young ass retire
I'm on fire
And I'm posted on the wall
Like a god damn fly
I'm a young pretty goon
You can see it in my eye
I done hit 20 licks
And I can't tell you why
And I can't tell you where
Got goons in Delaware
Knock your heads off your shoulder
Bitch I tote the infrared
Got the tats on my neck
Got the tats on my chest
Got the Super Saiyan Swag
Got a couple bills that'll
Get your ass knocked off the globe
Louis Kicks
Walking like a walking lick
Money sitting in the booth
Drop top Lexus I done flipped into a Benz doe
Got the presidential Lambo like I'm
B. Obama
I'm Soulja Boy Tell Em
If you didn't know, I'll put some money on your head
Got my young boys with me and
He doing like Simon Said
If I tell him 2 words
The he gonna make a move
Young Soulja Boy Tell Em
Got my young boys trappin
I think I'm Tony Montana
Niggas hating on young God
Cause he hot like a candle
I dunn tat my whole arm
The most songs in the rap game nigga!
