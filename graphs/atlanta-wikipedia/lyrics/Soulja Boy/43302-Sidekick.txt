Man just hit me on my Sidekick man, f'real man
Hit me on the T-Mail man
D-Wade
And I just flipped this phone on you one time
Pulled out the Sidekick, 3 is on deck (deck)
So much ice hangin off my neck (neck)
Told her this the new white D-Wade
On my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick
On my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick, on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my Sidekick (hit me up) on my Sidekick (hit me up)
On my
While I'm textin these girls on my Sidekick 3
All white t-shirt
with the phone to match
And when I flip it real quick it make your girls look at it
I ain't gotta say nothin, but man I'm on
Six-hundred fifty dollars just to talk on my phone
If you got the phone then you ballin
It's your folk Soulja Boy and you already know
I got stacks on deck when I walk through the do'
Man I can't believe that I'm rappin 'bout a phone
But what you won't believe is I wrote this song
T-E-K-nology
Sidekick 3
It's called T-Mail baby, hit me up
