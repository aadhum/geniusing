When I met you girl I tried to pay for dinner
Pulled out your card, I thought I had a winner
She said "Boy I got it," then I said no, but I like a girl who's in control
She rides a Barbie phantom
She lives in a Barbie mansion
she got a lot of money
and I know you rich
And you know I rich, so together we filthy
I'll lend it to you 'til it is empty
She was a rich girl, grew up in a messed up world
And I met her, she didn't think nothing less of me
She get the bigger picture
