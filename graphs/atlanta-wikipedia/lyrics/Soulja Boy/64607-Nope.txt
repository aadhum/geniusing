Ice on my neck
You can't get like me NOPE
You can't get like me NOPE
You can't get like me NOPE
You can't get like me
Step up on the scene and you know I got my jays on
Diamond cuts off in my grill and my stunna shades on
I do feel like no other UH UHH you can't get like me
And yall hataz talking stats but ain't neva seen a G
Tell me what the business b why these girls be diggin me
Cuz I keep it gutta or bcuz my name lil R A B
Hit the club deep so yall hataz bet not act tonight
Open up my mouth in the dark and my grill shine like a flashnight
