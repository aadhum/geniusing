Thank God I'm a Country Boy
Thank God I'm a Country Boy
I woke up feelin' like the mother fuckin' man
2005 I had a fuckin' master plan, 2011 I hold a Hundred Million
In my hand
Im the king, yes, yes, yes I am
Niggas talkin' down, but bitch im goin' up
Ridin' through my damn city like what, the fuck
Im a god damn mother fuckin' prophet
Lil' Dre
I might hit the mall and spend about a Hundred K
South panola high school
