I'm so dope, boy
Step up on the scene with the fresh Cartier
I walk through the school and made all the girls hoes
Soulja gon make it big
I'm so dope, boy
You can catch me at a party you know that it's me
With some fresh white shades and a fresh white T
With some conarite coated diamonds falling off of my chain
I'm so dope, boy
Heard about them haters they say they real but they ain't stopping it
