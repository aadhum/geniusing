Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Got all these bricks, get it I'm stackin', I'm packin'
Lil Soulja's too rich
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
To get all these bricks, stack it and flip
Lil Soulja too rich
I'm makin' it rain, yeah I changed the weather
Got Louie, Gucci, it's all on my sweater
Benjis on Benjis while swervin' in Bentleys
They comin' in, nigga tell me your order
I'm runnin' bands, I'm the man in my city
We swervin', ridin', and we drivin' in Bentleys
20 pounds of midget, that's what I'm trappin'
Them niggas hated cause I'm hot as the sun
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Got all these bricks, get it I'm stackin', I'm packin'
Lil Soulja's too rich
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
Whippin' my wrist, whippin' my wrist
To get all these bricks, stack it and flip
Lil Soulja too rich
I'm the one that they see up
Ice all over me, yup
