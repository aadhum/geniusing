Yo, Souljia, S-O-D
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt
Headed to the paper
I’m a paper chaser
And at 24 skatin, skating
Big ass pistol on my hip
I rock some new designer shirt
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
Yo, hundred K over my Louie belt
And I’m flying in my will
Skating, skating
I got them hatin, hatin
Hundred K on my Louie bill
A hundred K over my Louie belt
And I’m just sitting in my Bentley
24 I’m dating, dating
Grinding my Benz up
Popping out the foreign whip
I love to suck dick
