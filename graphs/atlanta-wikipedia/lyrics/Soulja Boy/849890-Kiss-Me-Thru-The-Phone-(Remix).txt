Baby, you know that I miss you
I wanna get with you tonight but I cannot baby girl
And that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you
I just wanna kiss you
But I can't right now so baby kiss me through the phone
(Kiss me through the phone)
I'll see you later on
Kiss me through the phone
(Kiss me through the phone)
See you when I get home

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Baby, I know that you like me
You my future wifey
Soulja Boy Tell Em yeah you could be my Bonnie
I could be your Clyde
You could be my wife
Text me, call me, I need you in my life, yeah
All that, everyday I need ya
And every time I see ya my feelings get deeper
I miss ya, I miss ya
I really wanna kiss you but I can't
