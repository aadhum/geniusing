1UP
Hit me up on Twitter
Facebook, All that, Youtube
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do what fly guys do
Stacks on deck, yeah we straight, wake up everything
Get that cake
Back then dude need the cash to borrow
But these days the Maserati and the Murcielago
Young Soulja, even back then I had swag then
Not too many stores that you can name I ain't drop cash in
I took off on them haters ain't been back since
I just wanna smoke weed and buy shoes
And do what fly guys do
I supplier man
He did what? Tell 'em that I'm not a fan
Everythang gold from the chain to the mouth piece
We can go East stay chilling on South Beach
And if you wanna go you can be with me
Smoke weed play 360
Make a stop in flight club cop kicks with me
