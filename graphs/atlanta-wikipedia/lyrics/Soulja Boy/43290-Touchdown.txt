A hundred racks a day that is a touchdown, touchdown
Both hands up cause it's a touchdown, touchdown
Beezy gon' stay up on, make it rich mane
Girls on your bumper cause I swags it like Kinte
And you know I got twelve writ, call me Wednesday
I'm gon' let my chain hang like Lil B The Based God
Try to snatch my chain then that nine touch yo' brain
Rearrange yo' frame and I rap like Gucci Mane
