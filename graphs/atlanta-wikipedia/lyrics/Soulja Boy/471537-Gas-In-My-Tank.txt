I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Went and dropped 7 hunnid on my robin jeans
Mix the gas with the lean, call it gasoline
bitch it's Rich Gang
Bugs Bunny mad at me I got all the carats
When I hop out the Ferrari all the bitches starin'
I drive a 'gatti
the new McLaren
I step in KOD, all my cash pourin'
Sippin' lean and the act and it got me snorin'
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
bad bitches gettin' too dramatic
pull out the choppa and eat'cha
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
I'm having good gas, I'm having good drank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
Lean in my cup,
gas in my tank
