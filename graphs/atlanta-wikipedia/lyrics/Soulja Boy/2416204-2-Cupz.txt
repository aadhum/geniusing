Give me 2 cups, Give me 2 cups
I need 2 cups, I need 2 cups
Give me 2 cups, give me 2 cups
I need 2 cups, I need 2 cups
Just look at my chain man it's snowing up
Just look at my ring, how glowing up
On the club standing on the couch
And my hood, I'm throwing up
Did 2 cups, I whip, know a young nigga rich
36 and all my hip wet, you know I can't slip
Icy sitting n my ear, broke boy get out of here
You ain't never seen a hunnid K, you ain't even shit
You ain't got 2 cups for King Dre mane you can't lean bitch
Pull up on a block and Lambo on my Celine shit
Water sitting on my neck
I need Act and Hi-Tec
Fucking bitches on the jet
Give me sex, give me neck
Percocet, Percocet and Molly
Pull up to the club, Maserati
Soulja, Soulja, Soulja Boy, Versace
Oh my god, whip it up like Hoorachi
Give me 2 cups, Give me 2 cups
I need 2 cups, I need 2 cups
Give me 2 cups, give me 2 cups
I need 2 cups, I need 2 cups
2 cups of lean, Xan with that lean
Pull up in a Porsche, with that heat
