Zan with that lean
Nuthin but Irene
I'm in my zan with the lean
Racks still on waist, busting out them jeans
I keep the hammer on me, I ain't worried bout a thing
I got all these bandz on me
all this ice on me
all these racks on me
Everything on me
Zan with that lean
Hoes going crazy when I'm on the scene
Gotta go to the mall
I gotta throw a band
Fall off in the club, and I'm leaning like kick stand
Soulja Boy my name
Bitch you know the gang
SOD Money Gang put that shit straight to your face
Boy I got them racks
Boy I got them tats
Album just went platinum, so I got them plaques
Lambo jet black
Bentley fire flame
Soulja Boy in the club
Bitch you know my name
Every where I go
Bitch I'm bout to blow
Ounce of that dro
Smoke it up on low
Every where I go
They takin pictures
Oh my god dawg, I got purp in that swisher
Stupid bandz on me
Stupid racks on me
Ridin down I-20, I'm lookin for some freaks
Everywhere we go dawg, they knowin who we at
They knowin who we are
Bottles in the car
