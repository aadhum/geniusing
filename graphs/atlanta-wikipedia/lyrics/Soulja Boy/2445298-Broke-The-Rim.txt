In the kitchen whip my wrist then I swim
All of my niggas get deli
Thousand dollars on the Versace ash tray
Two pistols and I feel like Max Payne
alley oop
Counting up money yeah, real street nigga
If you ain't getting no money, you ain't gon last nigga
When the sun hit my chain, it will blind your doney
I'm with your main thang, and she giving brain
