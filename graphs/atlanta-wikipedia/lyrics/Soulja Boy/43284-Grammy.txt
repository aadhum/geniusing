I done seen a lot of things in my life
I've been in a lot of situations
Y'know that I just think that the world should hear my story
You know I am saying? I think I'm here for a reason
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
I deserve a Grammy
Or land on Miami
S.O.D. pirates, I don't need a hook
Lyrics from a true legend, livin life through God's blessing
Big papers, long acres, top flight, no security
Black ice on me, call the jury
internet genius
18 years old with a drop top Phantom
DeAndre Way
What do you want from me cause I've given you everything
What do you need from me - are you not happy with anything?
Is it not good enough?
Am I not good enough?
Have I not gave enough?
What do you want from me?
