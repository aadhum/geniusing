from the A to motherfucking LA,
All I want to do is count money
All I want to do is count money
All I want to do is count money
All these rap niggas fake so stay away from me
All I want to do is count racks
Riding through my hood with them straps
Im a real nigga so I trap
Robbing banks like a heist game
100 thousand kilo ice game
Down in missipi in the country
Smoking on kush and counting money
Cooking hard I done made a hundred drugs
I be trapping hard for my momma trapped in
I be going hard doing numbers
All my young niggas yeah they stunting
I be smoking kush you wear cheap bandana
Riding through east Atlanta
Money dance
