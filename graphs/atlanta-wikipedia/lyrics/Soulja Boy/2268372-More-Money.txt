Stand on the block and get dough money
Winnin' it back and get more money
And when I'm on the road, I get show money
It's hard to get no money
Man, I get more, I get more money
Spendin' some show money
Stand on the block and get dough money
Mixin' the lean with the dope money
Stackin' it up and get more money
More money, more money, more money
Stackin' it up and get more money
Stand on the block and get dough money
Runnin' in the house with the four, man
I got the lean, pour a four, man
Nigga, they talkin', they get no money
More money, more money, more money
I got the clip like a movie
I'm shootin' this shit like Lil Boosie
Run in your house for the money, all of my niggas, they get to the money
Stand on the block and get dough money
Winnin' it back and get more money
And when I'm on the road, I get show money
It's hard to get no money
Man, I get more, I get more money
Spendin' some show money
Stand on the block and get dough money
Mixin' the lean with the dope money
Stackin' it up and get more money
More money, more money, more money
Stackin' it up and get more money
Stand on the block and get dough money
Runnin' in the house with the four, man
I got the lean, pour a four, man
Nigga, they talkin', they get no money
More money, more money, more money
