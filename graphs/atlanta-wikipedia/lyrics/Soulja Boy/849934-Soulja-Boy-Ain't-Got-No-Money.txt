Soulja Boy ain't got no money man hold up
Stacks on Deck, watch them big face fold up
I got the blow for the low
The five for the hive
Nicks and the dimes tow for five you know why
I'm the money man, stacks in the caseload
I connect you up I you can call me metro
I got what you need to get you blowed
Soulja Boy ain't got no money, nah, ho home folks
