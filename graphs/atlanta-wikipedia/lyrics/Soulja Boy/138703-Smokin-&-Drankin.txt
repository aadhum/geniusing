I'm smoking and I'm drinking
Gold all in my bracelet
I'm the shit these hoes must face it
I popped a molly I must face it
I got diamonds all in my bracelet
If she fine then I gotta taste it
Tell her pour it up don't waste it
I'm in the hood just chilling with my kinfolks
They say this shit sound like nintendo
See I popped a molly im focused
Look at these haters faces
They mad cos I made it
