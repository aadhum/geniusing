She making it work for the money
I pull up to the club I got all this money on me uh
Gold bottles of that ace spade
I can do this shit every day
She making it work for the money
I like the way that she twerking up on me
Drop it down
I’m the man in the city
I’m the man in the city
Rich gang, you know we get money on the regular
Rich gang got the bad bitches on my schedule
She twerking and she twerking tryin’ to get that fucking money, boy
These girls ain’t loyal and everybody know it
I can't sleep, I can't walk
I can't breathe, I can't talk
In the booth from the night to the morning
