I'm in that Bugatti fuckin' up my wrist
Standin' in the trap tryna whip a brick
Gatti
I done sold everything from that to this
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds in my chain
Rich nigga
Scuse me pardon me sorry
She give me sloppy toppy
QC the label the shit
Back then she ain't like me now I'm rich now
In the kitchen water whippin' break a brick down
Ridin' in that Rari to the trap
fishscale
