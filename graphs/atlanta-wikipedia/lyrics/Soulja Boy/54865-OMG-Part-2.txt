[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
Feeling like homer simpson drinkin out a beer
Get him out of here
swag of the year
Young Soulja Boy, I went and tattooed all my tears
Damn I had no fears
, I feel like a bitch
Shoutouts to Lil B, I'm sitting on my dick
Tatted on my wrist and my clip don't jam
Soulja Boy Tell Em, in the kitchen cooking yams
Trap goin ham, speakers going hammer
Took your main bitch, then I bammed her and I bammed her
Yeah, I rammed her than I jammed her
Nutted in her mouth
I fucked that bitch in Alabamer
