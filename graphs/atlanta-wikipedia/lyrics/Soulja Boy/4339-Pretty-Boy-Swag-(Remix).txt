Go hard in the paint like Flocka Flame
Look like bugs all on my fingers
It's funny to me, you are dumber than me
If you think your man got more money than me
My tennis shoes cost two thousand a piece
This right here is my new Lambo
Yellow on black with the yellow for Forgiato
Pull up with a yellow bone sippin' on Moscato
Red drop head ridin' round East Atlanta
I'm pretty boy swaggin' in the club I feel sexy (No homo)
No homo shawty but my chest is straight flexin' (Flexin')
