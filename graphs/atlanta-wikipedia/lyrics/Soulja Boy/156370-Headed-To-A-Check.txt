I whip a maserati
king soulja the mixtape
Always gotta count that money when I flex, damn
Rich gang soulja
bandz in my pocket, pocket
9 millimeter
Hit the secret Sundays, balling till thereâ€™s Monday
bitch I got blocks
Bitch I got knots,
sod rich gang
500 racks,
Swerving in that foreign Porsche off to Hollywood
