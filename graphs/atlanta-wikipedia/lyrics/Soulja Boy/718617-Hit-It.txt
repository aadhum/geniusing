My diamonds, they dancin'
Pull up to mansions
Hop out the Phantom
Twenty fifteen, I'm takin' a Grammy
I'm about to make a billion
All you niggas say you hitters
But all you niggas missin'
Red ruby, my diamonds
Stupid shit shinin'
Niggas can't find me
It ain't hard to tell time
Rolex, that lookin' so fine
Drippin' and dressed in VVS diamonds
Diamonds that came from Africa
Ride in that Lam, I go faster, bruh
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, I rock fire flame
