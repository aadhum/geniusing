Get out my face, ho!

Let me tell you about the life
And how you live when you is a star
Every single place you go
The people run up to your car
Everybody wants to talk, and everybody wants to jive
Everybody wants a handshake, or want a high five
And these ugly girls always got a friend
That wants to talk to you
Ain't got time for chitchat
I'm tryin to get this money
Soulja Boy, Can I have your autograph?
We keep it crunk like that!
I know a nigga in Chica-
