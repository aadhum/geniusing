36-O's ho ridin' round wit dat Nina
Ridin' wit a ho named Keisha, smokin on Keesha
My diamonds talk for me they say, "hi can I meet you?"
She fly high, high in the sky ho I can't see you
Ridin' wit a ho named Keisha,
She fly high,
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashin' out
Got a condo on my neck girl, I'm cashin' out
My diamonds talk for me they say, "hi can I meet you?"
Porche on my back
Ferrari on my wrist
got a Bentley on my neck
Need my money asap rock a fuckin hater fillins' yea I'll kill him cool
