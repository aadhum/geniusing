Let me hold you down
Down, Down
Let me hold you down
Down, Down
Aye girl why you wear that dress tonight ?
I swear to god it got you looking right
It's not a problem i can spend the night
It's up to you i can make the flight (swag)
I did you wrong but we can make it right
And if you tell me yes then it's a green light
My tongue in your mouth like a cavity
Baby hold me down like gravity
Babygirl she said she just graduated from vegas
Private jet to Orlando and let us see my acres
Meet me at the altar, girl in your wedding gowns
You can be my queen come and get your crown
Let's turn Atlanta, Georgia into a ghost town
Ya heard rumors about me but they ain't true
I take your first name and go get it tattoo'd
