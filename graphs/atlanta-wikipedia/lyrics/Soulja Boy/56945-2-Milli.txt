I did what I wanted, niggas did what they could
A lion wouldn’t cheat but a Tiger would
I’m feeling like Gucci’s label
So icey I really don’t care
Haters green as a pool table and they twice as square
I’m getting money out the tree y’all niggas getting switches
They pass me the game like Tom Brady
These rappers chances looking slim just like shady
Niggas locked behind my bars Im taking out prisoners
Sit back relax recieving my residual
I got so many gifts you would swear I stole Christmas
Word to the Grinch bitch
Broke so many records like I’m in the glass booth
Like I’m in the glass studio breaking out barriers
Back when crime mob was screaming Ellenwood Area
On your girl, head so much, like her favourite shampoo
Im so hot, haters evaporating
I spit hot flames bitch just like a dragon
And my pants saggin
Spell it backwards niggas
I’ma keep spitting til they crown me the best
Flying down the highway a million on the dashboard
Ya pack nines, I pack nine kilometers
Cannons flashing like you walking down the red carpet
First you was nameless now I'mma make you famous
