Dey Goin' Crazy,On Da Wall Iz My Picture
We Outta Alizay,Get Dis Guy A Picture(Please)
In Da Streets,30 Deep Wrong
We Gotta Show Out In Da Country,Think Its Up And Wrong
We Gettin' Some Much Money,Time To Take A Break
So Much Ice On My Neck I Think Its Bout To Break
On Da Hill,My House Gettin' Build
My Lass Check Lookin' Like My Cell Phone Bill
Any Thing You Need Hit Me On My Cell
Matta Fact What You Need I Got It For Sale
On Dont Buck Field Up I Knowa Lotta Ho's
Some Of Em' Be Stankin' Get Dis Girl A Waterhose
I Dropped Into Da Rap Game Its All Ours
In Fact Goin' Numba 1 In About A Couple Hours
Its All In My Jeans Mayne
