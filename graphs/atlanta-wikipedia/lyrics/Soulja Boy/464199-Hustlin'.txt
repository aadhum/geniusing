robbings
I got bricks underneath the fucking mattress
I got bricks
AK make you do a backflip
My Nigga I be trapping, trapping, packing
Whipping and flipping them chickens (them chickens)
Buggati no expedition
Pushing it to the limit
You already know
Fendi Ferragamo
When i'm shaking down the store
What up with my wrist?
900, Tony Hawk
Pull up in that Rick Ross
I flex up in the U-haul
