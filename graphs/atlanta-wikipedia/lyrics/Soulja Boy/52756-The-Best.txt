Listen up pay attention it's a genius spittin'
I forgot to mention, I'm the best rapper if you don't like me diss me
S.O.D. got game like a fucking arcade
Shoot at you duck niggas like a fuckin' gun range
Hottest in the rap game; title I obtain
Sumo money, I got heavy paper
Press me it's going down like a elevator
Cross tattoo below my eye rest in peace to all my haters
Nigga I don't play boy, I'm not Hugh Hefner
Bunnies in my mansion, and it ain't even Ester
Drop it drop it low girl
Futurism Chris Brown, I can transform her
I'm a fucking genius, Jimmy Neutron
Rich nigga shit, grape poupon
Water diamonds on my neck come and take a swim
Guard your life with them, cause you might drown
Speaking to existence, nigga I'm the best
Open my Louis cases looking like a treasure chest
All year 365, February to February
The only place where success comes before work is inside the dictionary
Niggas say they gettin money but it's counterfeit
My name gigantic, I sink em, titanic
They thinking got dammit Soulja Boy's flow is Cajun
I'm balling so hard I should be on the cover of Sports Illustrated
Twitter king 2 million in your faces
Instructional videos on you tube
So I can teach you how to do what I do
Word around town they got money on my head
Bitch I pull that fuckin chopper and they scramble like eggs
Don't ask me if I wanna fuck this, cause that question is rhetorical
GOT DAMN!
