You filthy animal
Nigga's mad, we up,
turned your bitch to an eater
Pussy nigga's better ease up, that mac can have them screaming Jesus
Polo horses everyday
ask Victoriouz, Stack or Starve
O.T.F. free my niggas, Tell the judge fuck a charge
All that real shit start here, check a bag like nike air
Check a bag like nike air, that real shit it start here, L's
Riding around with one-hundred's and fifties
Riding around with my hammer cocked
Stacks On Deck, we on top
And me and Lil Durk won't stop
Riding around, screaming fuck the cops
Other finger screaming fuck the ops
S.O.D. and G.B.E. the motto
O.T.F., 300 the motto
