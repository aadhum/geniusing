Man I do it big! From the cars to the clothes to the crib
Man I do it big! Fifty million, a hundred million's how I live
Man I do it big! ... Get it in
Man I do it B-I-G, big, B-I-G, big
All I do is stunt, eatin rappers up for lunch
I got a million albums sold, congratulations, well done
Soulja's heatin like a drum, and I made the club go dumb
I turn the haters on you, blast my speakers 'til they learn
Tryin to stunt like me, but I know that you ain't able
From internets and cable, from my hood to Asia
Rubbin ice on my ice cause my chain got a fever
My style is so different, my flow is prolific
Girls on my tip cause I'm a pro at business
My buzz is so hot, I got the internet locked
Shittin on the beat, like the beat is a toilet
A million dollars cash bitch I spent that on my bracelet
