I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I
I'm fresh to death and you like me
My shoes like my chain
Shine hard they might hurt your face
I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I
I ain't had no bathing apes
So I went to Nigo
And told him to give me some of that official Baby Milo
I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I
I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I
I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got me some bathing apes
I got I got I got me some bathing apes
I I I I I I
