Ocean Gang or drown, bitch!
S O D M G!
Niggas mad at, Bitches mad at me
10 chains, 5 rings
Bitch is talking down,
Niggas is talking down, Bitch I make my family happy
I never gave a fuck, I make my family happy
Ocean Gang, drown bitch, I'm back like I never left
Came out the water like a pretty-ass dolphin
I stepped in the club got damn I made it rain
Balled like Major Pain, too strapped like Max Payne
Niggas talking about me, SOD on me
SOD on everything man, this my life
God damn I love this shit, I wouldn't trade it for shit
Made a bitch touch her toes
Made her too off all her clothes
"God damn I'm paid"
Talking down on my clique, get flipped like a bird, bitch!
LV shades on and my pants saggin
Niggas mad cause I ride, and my paint candy
Niggas talking down, bitch, my swag outstanding!
Looking like I done came from another planet
Looking like I done swagged about another million
God damn, I'm some shit that you've never seen
Lil Dre bitch
AK-47, switched it for the heat seeker
I'mma find you if you talking down
I'm not Yung Joc, bitches going down
All that I'm hearing is Soulja Boy is getting cake
I don't ever go to sleep, how the fuck I'm gonna wake & bake
The fuck you niggas smokin?
by the fuckin ocean
Bitch tried to kick me off the plane
Cause my pants saggin
Went and caught the private jet cause I'm the swag daddy
Pull up to the red carpet, hopping out the Phantom
I gives a fuck what you think: I do what I want to
Ride through my trap, throwing money out the sunroof
Pretty Boy Swag: I'm so damn conceited!
And I look like a fucking genius!
God damn I smoke that purp, and that shit is stinkin
