More syrup than waffle house
It's time that we show all this racks we been spending
It's time that we go in and show them we winning
All of this money
Make it like it's magic
It's a pocket
It's a profit
Nigga want beef then
You know it's no squashing
Gang popped up
And make your click take her swim doe
Nine on my hip, I don't slip
I'm a blast it
You talking that fuck shit
Your body in casket
jay clean
