Keep my whole click stuntin'
Nothin' but them hundreds
Keep the ones don't want em'

Yes I do love money

Keep my whole click stuntin'
Nothin' but them hundreds

Keep the ones don't want em'
Nothin' but them hundreds

Cop a True Religion tee
Polo shoes on my feet and my pants are saggin'
Lookin' so pretty you'd thought I was a faggot
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)
And I got the combo (and it came with biscuits)
Woah, woah, woah, woah
Why everything green is good for me
Peep my ghetto poetry
I'm getting high and rappin' that's flow-a-tree
Is that a green carpet nah the hole floor a tree
Aww shit, there go a staple
At least you know my bitch centerfold
I belong in a Guinness from worldstar I rented
