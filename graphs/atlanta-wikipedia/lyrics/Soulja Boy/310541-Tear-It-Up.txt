So much money in my pockets bitch I thought I told you
Trying to count my pockets like what Beezy ate
Two straps cocked back like Max Payne
That's why a nigga so arrogant (Fuck 'em)
I might chill blow a L with Young L
My record label spent bout 10 mil (Cash)
I hear them talking Soulja Boy young flashing it
Ditch multiple vehicles, bitch, just to match my fitness
Homie bitch chose I ain't want the ho
