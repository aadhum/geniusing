So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
Hair weave killing like 2 Chainz
Hop up in my Phantom, here we go right
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
Looking at my diamonds, you see the ice
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
So cold, so cold, everything so cold
Riding in the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
On froze, on froze, riding through the city have my chain on froze
