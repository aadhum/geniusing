Why we gotta grow up in the world so cold?
Got girls getting raped, only nine years old
Police attacking us, that's why we defensive
Got a cure for AIDS, but it's too expensive
I look into my father's eyes, and see the resemblance
Both black, being positive and all about business
We got a black president, but everyone still suffers (Why everyone still suffer?)
