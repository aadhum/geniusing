Lisa, where have you been?
Gone for a while
Now you are back
I found my smile again because of you
I'm leaving the world with you tonight
I give it to you to show me the light
I'm leaving the world with you tonight
I give it to you to show me the light
I know that I've changed
It's just that my mind has been erased
Been erased
Don't leave again, yeah
I'm leaving the world with you tonight
I give it to you to show me the light
I'm leaving the world with you tonight
I give it to you to show me the light
