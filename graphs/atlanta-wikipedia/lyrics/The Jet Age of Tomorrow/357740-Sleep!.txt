Time passes by
When you're here
You've got me high
And its clear
We're, intertwined
And love is what's to fear
Your love just falls over me, and I don't want you to leave!
You're always in my dreams, in hues and fuchsias and greens
You change so much that it seems, that you don't love me any more
Well what the fuck am I breathin' for?
[Verse:2]
Time, passes by
When you're here
You've got me high
And its clear
We're, intertwined
And love is what's to fear
In which sleep, is one thing I'll never need
Your love just falls over me, and I don't want you to leave!
