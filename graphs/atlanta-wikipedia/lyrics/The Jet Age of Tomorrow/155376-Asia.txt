Mos Def said if it's something you can change around
Then keep quiet, you got nothing to complain about
I told you that we were kings and queens uncrowned
Too hard to break down, you were too compound
I won't feel like I made it, until my maids work grave shifts
Dreams will land you further than any promise could take us
Nothing's rewarded for loitering
but patience gets paid
If you're lucky you'll get more minutes but not the same ones back
So hold the 99 problems cause I'd rather have none
They're a star, you're a sun, just bigger but by far
Without you everyone's world would stay dark
There's no need to listen to the others when they talk
And people around me, they say that I'm crazy
But I do what I gotta do to get to where I wanna be
And people will use things according to how you sell it
