Vince Staples
Good morning, say hello to the asshole
I guess I must have smoked all the crack that my dad sold
Epar boy
ramshackin them fat hoes
I can't be taught shit, showin the class closed, so closed case
Reason bitches get to heavy breathin in a closed space
And throwin Sprewells on a fuckin Acura TL (uh)
ignorant as Compton College
Since my seven grade suspensions, I've been on some "Fuck religion!"
I believe in me, stackin money up, and fuckin bitches, who agrees ?
you should bring a quart or two of bleach
Play hard as gay baseballers
large enough to shake Harlem
As my hunger grows in capacity
Citizens scatter rapidly, in front of and after me
But you can not be mad at me cause it would be a tragedy
To hear the blasphemy of saying "This is not a masterpiece"
So go ahead, step in our path
