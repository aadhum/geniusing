[Verse 1: Matt Martians]
She's gorgeous, one of a kind
Word around town she's hard to find
I saw her, the other day
Walking down the street, around my way
I stopped her, to say some words
She told me love was for the birds
I asked her, if there's a chance
[Hook]
Maybe I'll see you around
Even though I'm not from this part of town
Maybe I'll see you around
Even though I'm not from this part of town
I saw her, once again
Walking down the street, with a friend
I wonder, why she's back
Maybe it's just me and she's trying to act
Or maybe, she's really shopping for clothes
In the part of town where no one goes
So I follow her, around the block
Then I realize she's tryin to score some rock
She looks as if, she don't care
Then she looks at me as she flips her hair and says
Maybe one day I'll find, a girl as beautiful as she was
But that's not riding the white horse
Can't have no girl that the white horse now can we
