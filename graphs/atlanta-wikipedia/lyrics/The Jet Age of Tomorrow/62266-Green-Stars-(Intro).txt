Climb into the stars
Is all it took for me to realize
Where we belong
As the Voyager my life came crashing down
I got an invitation to climb into the stars
By an old friend of mine
I took that invitation
He took me to the 5th Echelon
But as I was elevated
I realized that my path is music
And that I had to experience the world
It's a place where you're allowed to explore your mind freely
But one thing we can all agree on is it never harmed anybody before
Maybe one day mankind will understand
The things while we're here can't hurt us
And what we make will
And when we destroy our world, we will be to blame
Who knows, maybe the world will change
And I won't have to explore the 5th Echelon every night in my room
