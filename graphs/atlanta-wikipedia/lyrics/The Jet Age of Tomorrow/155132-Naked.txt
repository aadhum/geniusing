OF...OF...
I-I-I always hop to music like I was hip
The thought a chip in my pocket made a nigga spit
My race was first place, yours was fourth and fifth
They ask me about my crew and where the fuck we from
Bitches hound me and surround me, they're all puppies son
well Ima' end it tonight
I got a pint of lean, stir it in my remix sprite
Sip slow for the fast lane life
Go from dirt ditches to riches, broke figures to fixes

The world is under Odd Futures feet

We gonna make it (Yeah)
We gonna make it
Life is a bitch
We're gonna strip that bitch naked (Oh)
We gonna make it
We gonna make it
Life is a bitch
So help me strip that bitch naked
