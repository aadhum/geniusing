I've known you for years
And you've always made me smile
Every second I spend with you
It's so worth the while
Because you bring me joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Because you bring me joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Joy...
I lose all control
When I see you call my phone
What's crazy is we're not committed
But I do want you as my own
Because you bring me joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Because you bring me joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Joy...
Joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Because you bring me joy
But you're not my lover
No, no, no
Joy...
