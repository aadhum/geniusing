There's a monster in my bedroom
I saw him yesterday
And then he disappeared under the bed
He didn't even say hey
There's a monster in my room
I don't know what to do
There's a monster in my room
I don't know what to do
I saw him the other night actually
He was playing on my bed post
And then he disappeared again
All I know is
So I finally see him again
He came out to play
Went to run in my shadows
Because I, I
I loved him
There's a monster in my room
There's a monster in my room
There's a monster in my room
He's shy
He's lonely
And unfortunately he's not for me
He's a monster he would never understand
But he's just a monster in my room
I want to do
He's just a monster in my room that I want to do
Or maybe not
What do you think?
