You're all dressed up, in your Sunday's best
The type of girl, you wear around your chest
She's on the floor, breaking a sweat
You wined and dined, what happens next?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You're all dressed up, like you was tryna get it in
You was the type of boy, your momma wouldn't let come in
I know I sound retarded
And I'm leavin'
