[Part I: A Happy Ending]
And I know, I won't regret this
So I go - I know your parents, aren't home now
I creep into your window
You still don't hear a thing though
Then I hear your voice
Then I see you, styling your hair
I begin to creep in
You don't even, hear a noise
I get in position
And my plans, begin to deploy
As I start, to move forward
You then, see me
So startled you begin to run
As you try to escape
I catch you at the door
I been take action
Now your lies, are no more
