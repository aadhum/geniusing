Uh wassup whats goin on?
You got on some nice jeans
You don't wanna take em off?
Naw what?
I know you ain't comfortable.. what?
Girl take off them rocks, let it rock
Let it drop, and don't you stop
Girl take off them Trues
Let it do, just what it do
Between me and you
It's pajama time
Pajama time (6x)
It's pajama time
And we don't have to do much
And you don't have to rush
But girl I gotta see what's in those jeans (wooh!)
It's not the same it's a new way
And don't be scared, I'm just your roommate (wooh!)
You can be my plaque on the wall
I'mma put yo back on the wall
And I'mma give it to you
Like you never had
Then we fall back on the floor
I'mma put yo back on the floor
And let the good times roll Baby
Girl take off them rocks, let it rock
Let it drop, and don't you stop
Girl take off them Trues
Let it do, just what it do
Between me and you
It's pajama time
Pajama time (6x)
It's pajama time
I be reconstructing walls
I got blueprint to that pussy
That's that bulldozer dick
Girl what you know bout tha
I know you heard that bend over
Girl I'm so bout that
She a redbone with red bottoms
