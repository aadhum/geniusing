Common sense would tell you leave me alone
Cause friends with benefits can do what they want
It’s not the fact that you be doin’ me wrong
Cause you not doin’ me wrong
Cause we can do what we want
(I’m sayin’)
Common sense would tell you leave me alone
But friends with benefits can do what they want
& I’m just sayin’ we can be cool if we want
But I'mma do what I want
Cause she gone do what she want
We friendsss
I think I’m fly now, yeah heaven right up under me
& she give that pussy to me, automatic stemmin’
I done blessed all her friends, can I get a witness

But whenever you call I’m still on my way
I want you to see the look on my face
When I’m sleeping alone, I’m rubbin’ on your space
