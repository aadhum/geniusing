I know that hearts arnt meant to be apart
Arnt mean to be broken
t ain't my
Fault your man was a dog so take me as a
Token
while im singing this song if your
Man did you wrong your supposed to remain
Strong while im singing this song if your
Man did you wrong (did you wrong) you should
Tell him that your badder than ever yes you
Badder than ever now your finner then ever
You were designer whenever you dont need him
Like no no no no-oo (tell him no noo noo)
And you dont need him like no no no no-oo
Say girl your man a dog well i'm that spelled
Backwardas
if you think you need him then your
Going baccwards
