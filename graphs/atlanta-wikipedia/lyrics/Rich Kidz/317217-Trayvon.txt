Rest in Peace to Trayvon
You know, i feel like i Trayvon wit a bankroll
You understand what im sayin?
Got me feelin' like young nigga can't eat, can't sleep with out the metal on him
Got me feelin' like, that i needa pack a piece in the streets, cuz its relevant
Sorry sir we dont look alike
Sorry sir we dont feel alike
And i look like a killer right?
Dat mean u wanna kill me right?
But you ain't even gotta worry bout da goon
Gotta worry bout the fool wih the tube
And i know my words limited
But with all do respect fuck Zimmerman!
Young niqqa got his hoodie on, trayvon with bankroll
And we some ATL lieutenant, try one of us thats a big N O
Got cuz locked up got boosie locked up
Why the fuck Zimmy out doin' what he want
