These niggas must got crabs
or on some yellow lean
'Cuz these niggas itchin' for some 'tension
You know what I mean?
Money tall as Garnett
I was taught to hang wit' niggas that'll die witcha'
And keep a nice tender on the side witcha'
And I don't hang wit' broke if you hang wit' broke then broke gone getcha'
I might got hoes on me but ain't no ho in me
