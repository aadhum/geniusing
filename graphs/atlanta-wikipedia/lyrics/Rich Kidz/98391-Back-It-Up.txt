She want bank rolls, on bank rolls, on bank rolls
On rolls
She gotta Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Back it up, Back it up, Back it up
But don’t stop
Add it up, just add it up, add it up
But don’t stop
For bout three stacks
I ain’t Andre
I am Ms. Jackson
Shawty got a spot, got a car
One kid and a baby daddy
But she do it on her own
He a dead beat dad
He don’t never got money
He don’t make it happen
Onyx, loved Cheetah’s, went to Blue Flames
Thought about Follies but she went to Magic
Kick shit call me young Liu
