And if you're trying to see the future man, then here I am
Uh, I went to Daytona for a week and caught that extra tan
Nigga trying to rob me gonna need an extra man
Too many bricks for the car we need an extra van
Too many pounds for the house, we need some extra land
Ain't no more soda for the dope, go get some extra cans
That's too much soda for the dope, it's gonna be extra tan
This guap too big for these little jeans, I need some extra pants
The O.G.'s say I'm cool which means I'm extra fan
New cars, suicide doors
And if you get right baby all this yours
You dig?
Hey I'm a real dirty boy I serve my Jays mixed
And I'm committed to the swag like Cooley them
I'm blessed like "Atchoo,"
Hey Skooly bleed blue but it's "Soo Woo" to the roc crew
