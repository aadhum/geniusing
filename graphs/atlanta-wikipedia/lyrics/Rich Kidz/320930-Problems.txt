All this dough, all these hoes, i got choices
Never divide i multiply im gone reside with mines
Won't neglect the fact that mamma didn't search for contraception
I put two grams in a blunt (and we smoke)
Syrup all in my soda pop.
I might roll me up a blunt just to smoke my problems away
I might pour me up a drank just to sip my problems away
