Flexin'
Ballin'
We stressing oops no sorry
Girls texting and haters keep callin'
I see you
Don't sit on that Louis I got couch rules
I'm not on the team but I be ballin' though
I'm not from the three but rest in peace to Mario
Teezy told me that my circle is too big
But I'm too busy wondering if my shirt is too big
Like Wayne I don't stunt I stunt hard
See I'm
Ballin'
Tryna get the V.I.P we bought it
We not friendly don't get em started
You offended oops I'm sorry
Ok now me and Skooly flexin' nigga doing threats and duckin cards
Cause walkin in the mall I got bands so i had to march
5 star bitch good brain 8 years apart
I see you no you see me
I'm turned up in the club catch me in V.I.P
And I wear the most expensive clothes just so you can notice me
True Religion Robin Jeans that's what boost my self-esteem
Cash rule everything around me and the Bentley cream
[Verse 3: Skateboard Skooly & Kaelub]
I catch ya main broad stealin' but I let her leave
But I'm a young cat
But still a bossman
Tommorow having coffee with David Letterman
