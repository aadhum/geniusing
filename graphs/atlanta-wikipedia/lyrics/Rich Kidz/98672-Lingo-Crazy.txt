We go Lingo crazy
(Washam)

Ayyyy…
We don’t say what’s up, Washam
That drophead mean that phantom
deuce
nat-nats
In Cali with my plug
Tell Yayo catch that pinack
twerking
I told her bring that binnack
Bout to pull up in the one
Done from working out the six
Shout out to the Bricks
flexxin
Ok what’s happenin I’m skate what’s crackin
My blue chucks with my khakis
Got bout ten racks in my saggers
racks
choppers
I chief a forest
OOooOOoo
Hit the cup of the drink
L
I heard she swallow babies
Timbrons been rocking lately
Like Clorox we get faded
Flow sick, first floor at Grady
Check up 5th floor on Grady
