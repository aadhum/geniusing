We gon' hit all the hemispheres
Bottom Dirty South, yeah
Caution, track slippery
Suckers, getting hit for losses
Not even makin' it back, to the line of scrimmage
Goodie MO-B, two dope boys, and Mister C
sky high, sky high
The sinner, the saint
still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg,
chryslers and buicks
Friends, Romans, countrymen lend me you eardrum
they steady move them keys like Bob James
Coz old man winter's arrived the temperature dives
November just died, December's alive
Thus it ain't no typical ride
Just individual way to bring home the bacon
When bacon was all gone
Making it our own taking me all wrong
We've all indulged in the bulge of these no-nos
No you ain't solo, its even lower levels you can go
Take sun people put them in the land of snow
