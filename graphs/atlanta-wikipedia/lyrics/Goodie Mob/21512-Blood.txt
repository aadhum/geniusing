juice of cooked goose
My mind back home, I roam the path in the trees
Your feet can't fit in my shoes
Dixie Hill
I try to make sense outta nonsense each and every day
I got to cos things is kinda crazy round the way
Each word that I say may cut you like a knife
And totally influence and change somebody life
Who me? I'm 19, and best to have seen
What I already seen
Life taught me a lot
That you ain't gotta carry no gun to get shot
I watch my niggas die for no reasons
In my neighbourhood ain't nothin changed but the seasons
Them crackers don't give a fuck, then again why should they
They evil from their head to they toes so how could they
East bound
Was it because I didn't finish C-O-double L-E-G-E?
