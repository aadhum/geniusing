"Uh-huh... Ben Hill been real
Still trill, Southwest
Y'all niggas wanna do somethin' with it?
Y'all niggas wanna do somethin' with it?
In the ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
And some of my friends done died befo'
In the ghetto
Ghetto, ghetto, ghetto, ghetto
That's why I can't seem to let go
Just like them folk that say they know me from my old days
I know you wonderin' about my spirit and my old ways!
You hearin' me spittin' the piece of mind, got you froze in time
Playin' catch-up with yourself
I'm on another level
Now from the go child
My name is Lo
God done gave me this vision quite some time ago
Now just a second y'all
It got to be
For every thought is fulfilled in the prophecy
I'm supernatural and there is no stoppin' me
Even the ghetto is still God's property!
