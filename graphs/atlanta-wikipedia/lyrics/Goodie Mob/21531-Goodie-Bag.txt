Put some fire on that ass end of that weed
Cuz, you know me, giving me
Left hand dap,
P-funk
Escort
A cool breeze got my lips chap, morning slap some
Soul in my bread basket gap contain
X marks the spot,
the cut laying
A slew of empty gas in my tank
A buck thirty looking ugly, think but it ain't gonna stop no show
Ol' burd putting a buzz in you ear, "It's gon' snow"
Or maybe perhaps sleet, rap up the beat
Outside barely made it to your wake
Looking like Mr. Fisher, dickie down no suit, no tie
Niggas ain't gonna be able to just get by no more
You leaving the hotel, 254
Today was good to me, I went to the Goodwill
With the ten dollar bill, got that London Fog out the back paid the man
Me and Khujo and T-Boo, three jack lumbers
On the loose,
cut your ass Lo like Cee
Be under the water,
half these figures around me be hollering Newt
Now what the fuck has this politician did for you
Complain, complain but Mr. Clampett ain't gon' change
Just rib your ass up just to gut your pockets out
I heard Bill put two G's up for some folks
That they found in they house beat up and I don't discuss
That color scheme that they fall on
Cause the scheme that they fall on don't match with my tone
See, I wonder will I walk the streets in 1995
And not have to make bond from 254, uh
Will somebody please turn the lights on 166
I can't see where the fuck I'm going
I can't do shit but get mad
I can't keep get Billie and his uncle out my fucking Goodie Bag
Without your shank you can't thank
Without your niggas you up the creek, stank with a ass fool of ore
Taking what I say for what it's worth, it don't matter
Cause how I feel might be triggered from thoughts I had in the past
Now I struggle to reach the sky why try so hard
If all I'mma get is spit on cause life at the bottom ain't hitting on shit
First of all, I stand a little more than five feet tall
But we can still brawl nigga, I ain't scared at all
I guess you niggas don't know or can't see
That it ain't even wise stepping to me incorrectly
cause we the maniacs
With the chunky goodie sac's,
But I still swing low with the lumber jax
Organo-I-Z-E
Uniquer than a lot of MC's out today
Like it when them chunky hoes can dance, I'll enhance
The microphone when it's in my grip, I do not slip
Ha-ha-ha, well Great Scott, is he a thief?
It seems like he has a mouth full of gold teeth
Ooh shit!!
