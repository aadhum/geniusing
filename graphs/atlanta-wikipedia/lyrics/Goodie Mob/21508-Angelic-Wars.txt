I don't be sittin' in a trap slangin' lil' peewees
See, I used to wear my shoes until I couldn't no more
Now I hit the store, when the lace get old
I relate to my folks
To make you think this 'bout my third album
This supposed to be the times when the moon and the sky turn purple
So watch this full circle
Black wire touch red
Red wire touch black
Me and Big Slate got this drop wit some gator backs
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how much I make
He get the rims, I get the system and we leave him the tapes
Who gives a damn about catchin' a charge
It's been a while since I seen my boys
