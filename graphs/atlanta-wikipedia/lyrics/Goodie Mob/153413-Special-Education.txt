They call him Gipp Zagga
It's the mutant, mister get down
My right leg longer than my left foot
See spirits off of people, I don't see color
Conceived in the South
The industry: they look like me
I don't wear the clothes you wear
I'm just different and I don't care
It's kind of sad and it's a shame
Everyone wants to be the same
If you are listening here and now
I'm sure I can show you how
It's okay to be afraid
Don't you want to be special
I eat nuclear waste and spit atomic bombs
Plutonium explodes, that's my trademark
Mushroom clouds inside
Gamma rays torch my system, now I'm going green

once conceived, boy, they broke the mold
No one's original, Attack of the Clones
Invasion of the swagger-snatchers
Aim for the dome
Scientists stood around in silence as I was being born
Was I quote, unquote special or was there something wrong
And the fact that I could talk already, that was a thriller
Summa Cum Laude
X-Men
Let me put something poetic into plain English
I'd rather die than to not be distinguished
When V.I.P. stands for "Very Insecure People"
S.P.E.C.I.A.L
ATL
I'm friends with the mayor
