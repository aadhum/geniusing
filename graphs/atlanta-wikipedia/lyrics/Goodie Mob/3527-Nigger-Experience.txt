And a nigga is what a nigga was
And a nigga done read history but yet his eyes didn't see
The only reason you a nigga is because somebody else wants you to be
Well a nigga uneducated, intergrated, singin' "We shall overcome"
A nigga trying to be white is what a nigga seem like have become
Dividing and conquering
When they say the lighter shade of black is okay
Since a nigga had got grown, had a little bitty of nigga of my own
Should've known I couldn't show 'em no better what I was showin'
Shit, I could've hit the club as fresh as I could be
Really, all for another nigga to see
You know how a nigga get when he see another nigga outfit
Don't want nobody to have what he ain't got
Somebody get drunk, get mad, and get shot
I'm sick of lyin' I'm sick of glorifyin' dyin'
I'm sick of not trying, shit I'm sick of being a nigga
And she looked deeply into my eyes and said brother don't you know
You complain about being black
When they mad coz they can't be black no mo'
When in actuality the fact is you ain't a nigga because you black
You a nigga cause of how you act
