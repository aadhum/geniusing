Now don't get mad, nigga get glad
Goodie got them brand new trash bags
la familias
Diamond cut
Soul been gone, disappeared like the dude
Lies
lies
Nigga I ain't shit, I just know how to rhyme a little bit
Nigga please, I'm still trying to squeeze my fat ass in where I fit
Now I got a little dough, but it ain't that much mo
Than any other nigga I know
We all still poor
I don't sell dope (what you doin?)
I sell hope
Late one night I was in a pearl white Acura Legendary
I got that thang with me cause it's necessary
Shit, I was just ridin
Wasn't even thinking'bout collidin
But I kept seeing the same headlights running stop signs and red lights
He said "you know what it is, you done seen it before"
Now remember, shit, you could've died tonight
And I would've been in the right
I ain't even pissed you could just drop me off at the house
Cause I ain't ready to die about nothin like this
He-he-he-he-he-he
Everythang cool my nigga, you could just drop me off at the house
Knahmsayin?
