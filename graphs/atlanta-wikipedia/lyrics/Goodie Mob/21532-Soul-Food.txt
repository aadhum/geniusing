My old boy from the point
But I'm from Southwest and every
But I got my crew
Didn't come for no beef cause I don't eat steak
I got a plate of soul food chicken, rice and gravy
Drinking a cup of punch, tropical
Now I'm full as tick
Got some soul on blast in tha cassette
Food for my brain
Hot wings from Mo-Joes
Got my forehead sweating
Celery and blue cheese on my menu next
Southern Fry won't allow my body to lie still
It's such a blessing when my eyes
Get to see the sun rise
Everythang that I did
Different thangs I was told
Just ended up being food for my soul
[Hook]
I'm on 1365 Wichita Drive
Mickey's
"red dye" between two pieces of bread
Spaghetty plus her monthly flow
Fuck Chris Darden, fuck Marcia Clark
Looking at Lenox from the outside
With a stare no money to go inside
fried chicken
Macaroni and cheese and collard greens
Ain't never had allot but thankful for
The little that I got why not be
It was a line at tha beautiful
JJ'S Ribshack was packed too
