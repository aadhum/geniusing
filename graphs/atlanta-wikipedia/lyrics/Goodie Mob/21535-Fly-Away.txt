Now what they know about the banana and mayonnaise (mayonnaise)
Slices of toasted bread on the nap-kin
If you don't like where I stay, fly away,
There's a ghetto in every city (know dat)
Ready to call Earl
I'm hearin rumors too
That you so gone off that D and PCP, that thoughts
Of lettin another man sample your wine haunts your mind
Look like the color pink
Rubbin elbows with the wrong folks
Secretaries terminated after seein the boss pack fudge
Dirty men need to do more than bathe, huh
How's about burned at the stake
Like the rest of those Sodomites
Even though you had beautiful kids and a wife
He still bent both ways, ain't no due process
For boys that become guls or verse vica
Field niggas control this
Pin the hollow point tip
On this gay rights activis
to get you wet
You ends today, fly away (fly, fly away)
(Fly away, now)
Well, I'm from the dirty, filthy nasty dirty south
Some of you niggas still think we soft (know they do)
And I swore, I wouldn't never write no rhyme like this
But now you're startin to piss me off, ha ha hah
Oh yesh y'all, Sugah he got that silky Southern drawl
Every tooth in my mouth, got gold on em' all
I'm 'eal strong, and we don't want no bad blood
But it is some, it is some
Nigga think he gotta, better mind frame then me
Nigga really think he got mo' game then me?
When we on your side of town, we don't ask why
We abide by the rules that y'all live by
And see, you're welcome to come, you're welcome to stay
But any disrespect, we WILL make yo' ass fly away
