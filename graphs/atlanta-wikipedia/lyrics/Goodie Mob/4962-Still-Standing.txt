Didn't have no money for college he was taught the street knowledge
Every two weeks I see Sam
Milledgeville
Salt lick teddy bears in the college student's room
Speed, Gipp got that too
This most loved invention, my conciousness is an extension
It's amazing, how the streets do the majority of raising
Of children who end up dead before hearing what you said
It seems like abortion, when I just write a small portion
It's either crumpled up or torn without lettin the thought be born
Young minded, and blinded in those days; I didn't want to
Have a thought that I couldn't raise, nurture, and care for
Be there for, help prepare for, the times ahead
When someone doesn't agree with what is said, huh
And if they did, don't get all arrogant cause that's my kid
The life cycle starts all over again
