I need some understanding cause I'm losing my mind
I know I'm not your lady and your house isn't mine
Just need some understanding just to keep me in line
I know you grindin' baby but see you're bout me sometime, sometime
Listen, I'm tryin' to put some distance in between things
But damn it's a dream team
Nothing anyone should have to hurt for
But tell me who does number two work for
Babe, go get whatever you want on your wish list
But don't ask me about my business
She's beside you, not above you
Understand little mama you ain't the main squeeze
But shit, you got some house keys
I can't put you on the same boat
But I can dock at the same port
