One time
But I'm still flickin ashes a lot of other motherfuckers snort dust
Of everyday in every way but the right
I control the substance my people fiend for at night
Sold me out for 3.5 grams of neighborhood clout
Now what the fuss be 'bout
I'm back home from the bullshit
One squirt
And you locked down forever
Remove yo hat under the ceiling
Of this building
Cee-Lo:
Well I woke up this mornin with the same frustration from situations like these
Got a call about some work from one of them temporary agencies
No high school diploma or any college degrees
I can't enlist but they'll draft me if there's a war overseas
Oh please
Of course I can slice some OZs
But I'd rather struggle on my feet than to live on my knees
So my uniform tight workin all night at Mickey D's
Got about 90 dollars and some change after the government
Get they fees
These minimum wages ain't enough to feed my babies
Purposely these limitations on black folks opportunities
Stop carin at all went on and did a few small burglaries
It seems like my faith done turned into forgotten memories
And I ain't gettin away with nothing because I know He always sees
But see right now I need to see how I can get this here dope sold
I done stuffed in my pocket as many rocks as it can hold
They gonna get high so I'm gonna get my money even though it's freezin cold
Now how many times you done heard this story told?
Believe it or not, there's some very intelligent junkies
But dependencies is eating away at they souls like disease
nyone can turn into somebody who covets and envies
Unequal economics can easily make you some enemies
And the crime rate never drops so the cops ride around in threes
I knew he would have killed me if I did anything but freeze
They found the rest of the dope in some nearby shrubberies
In a dimlit room being questioned by these authorities
And they gave me some time in correctional facilities
And now my woman's gotta take on a man's responsibilities
