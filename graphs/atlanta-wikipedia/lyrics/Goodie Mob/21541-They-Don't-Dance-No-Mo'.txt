Like a beach in Martinique
Goodie back up on they feet
Set it straight for the nine-eight
They get off on holdin folks hostage
They good, fo' casin malls and leavin broken glass
Where you park,
triggers fourth and long, zone three
Deep coverage, man under
We used to break doin eighty-three
2 Live dropped, and we was Throwin That D
Pat everybody down, before they leave this piece
Hit Atlanta live
and break a few rolls
hold the walls
Just in case security can't control the brawls
