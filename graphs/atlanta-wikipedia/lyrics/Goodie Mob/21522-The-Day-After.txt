We didn't die for nothin' cuz we're finally free
My Grand be gone after a 103 years of blood sweat and pain
And never complained
The last words that the nurse heard was the song she sang
Died tired of this living thing
Most I knew never made it to drinking age
Sometimes I fight Gipp
Should I spend or should I hold on for what tomorrow brings
Fly ain't that roll egg, so many lips in my head
Seeing some act up from one tste out the cup
Can't build me up to cut me down
Gipp is in your game, but Gipp won't play your game
In the day after...
The good that die mostly over bullshit
with
hose
trame
