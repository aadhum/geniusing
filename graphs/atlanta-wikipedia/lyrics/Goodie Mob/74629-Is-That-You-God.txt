I think about when I lost half of my leg
I think about the quake that left 40 thousand dead
I think about the troops coming home from the east
I think about taking a mark and worshiping the beast
I think about me, my momma and my brother
How we grew up on chapel road and had to struggle
I think about all the victims of the hurricane
I think about all the homeless folk, when it rains
think about when we came over here as slaves
Sometimes I don't make the right choice
You know my momma say she hear it in my voice
I'm just a brotha with a plan and a purpose
Got some good people standing in my circle
Family matters got some folk that'll hurt ya'
Or maybe even help ya'
It's morning and the prodigal son is shinin'
I yawn and stretch and get dressed for some mountain climbin'
I wear it well but this is not by my designin'
The inevitable has impeccable timin'
And if you left it up to me I'd say never
Only God could've brought us back together
And all I say is I obey
You see, the family tree is tatted on my back forever
Uh, and I feel purpose
The salvation army is at your service
Cause uh, our only challenge is balance
But I believe that the will of God is perfect
Now let's go
