O.M.N.I
Plenty niggas sittin in jail just to eat a decent meal
And the way they treat me today like they shit don't stank
But fo' me from the beginning a fucked-up hand was already dealt
But now a days my mac-11 is my one and only teacher
SWAT's
Is it you don't know? Is it they don't show?
crackers
No where to go but Lovejoy, can't exit off here
Got me trapped on your high concrete want me to speak
Took away Mosley and Maddox for the weekend
Kept me on your one way streets
For the arrestee show no pity, siege be under the city
Hidden eyes on poles that light my path
