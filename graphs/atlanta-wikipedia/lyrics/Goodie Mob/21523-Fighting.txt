4:30 was the time, I'm feelin' a pain in my chest
I guess I smoke too much sess
Makin' a nigga mo' slow
advertising swine on Channel 2 when in the same breath
You tellin' me don't eat from that plate increasin' my blood
Outbreaks on my skin
You settin' me cancer on a stick
Prayin' like a mantis
Thirty-five cents to my name and that's fo' a blunt man
The way thangs goin' today I might as well be dead,
The voices on the radio got me seamed
Can't put a smile on my face cuz my pockets ain't straight
Early as phuckk, eight fifty-one
Last night I barely got some Z's ... sleep...uh
I can't ol' Burd in the next room havin' nightmares
It sound like wind blowin' when she weep, speak
slave camp
I utter very little words, I'm thinkin' about a ciggy I snatched
From the jaws of death, a sack of crumbled herb ...
Rollin' down Main Street
East Point, I swerve,
Campbelton Rd, Southside
Eight fify-five,
jacket
to the liquor store
Closed down,that's alright I go holla at this beeso I know
Who work at the Texaco Gas station
pacin' back down memory lane
Feelin' strange can't Explain, so bare wit me pleae
Thru this green light I sees
That tramp that gave me herpes
wreck, wham, crash, stumblin
The ride empty the Glock fo', five, D.E.A.D
Woke up handcuffed inside

Now Stephen K-I-N-G had the story all wrong
Blood last five points
Is because the system is designed to keep our third eyes blind
But not blind in the sense that our other two eyes can't see
You just end investing quality time in places you don't even neeed to be
Yeah it's true, Uncle Sam wants you to be a devil too
Is if I put it in a verse y'all listen to some bullshit first
natural born killas
Think about the slave trade when they had boats with
Thousands of us on board
And we still was praising the Lord

Goodie Mob means, "The Good Die Mostly Over Bullshit"
