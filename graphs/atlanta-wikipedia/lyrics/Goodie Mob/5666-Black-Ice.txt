Do you ever see that stuff that be
When it get cold that ice that you can't see?
See that shit happens sometimes
Yep, black ice
Gipp flipped like a dip, slipped, fell on the black ice
Circulate like a Sunday paper
Thirty-five degrees, nippy tonight
Don't forget the ChapStick, lips dry quick
When the jack out
Take the slack out
Hibernatin' 'til we came back out
Tighter than fades, I'm knowin' my plays
Fiendin' for the taste of menthol
Lookin' for a squeeze play
So quit flexing, we speakin' about
Somethin' that's refreshing to the earlobes
Pay for the room and still be in pimp mode
Like Iceberg
'Cause niggas are biting that same stupid shit, I mean that feces
Boy, don't beep me, if you ain't got no work
I'm strictly 'bout these verses like the ones you hear at church, boy
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your eardrums
It was a beautiful day off in the neighborhood
Yellows and greens and blues and browns
And greys and hues that ooze beneath dilapidated wood
See summer rolls around, niggas holla bout change
Then they steady move them ki's like Bob James
Just individual's way to bring home
The bacon when bacon was all gone
We've all indulged in the bulge of those no-no's
No, you ain't solo, there's even lower levels you can go
Take sun people, put 'em in a land of snow
