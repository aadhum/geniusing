I make your girlfriend ho about it
And if I lose it, I ain't gon' cry about it
I ain't no dummy god damnit I ain't about to die about it
But fuck wid me though, I'll let a few fly about it
Don't test me boy, because I about it!
People all in my wallet hopin to frolic we gon' see ho
I'mma let you suck my dick to meet your quota
Thinkin a nigga spiritual tryin to build but you don't know me
