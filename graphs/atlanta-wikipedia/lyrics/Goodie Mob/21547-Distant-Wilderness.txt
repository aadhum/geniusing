Take a stand and make your hand a fist
When it's time, I ain't trippin, I got my date
And you got yours too, I
Where ever I am, you can feel God is present
In the midst of darkness if you spark up bet somebody gonna see it
It is necessary for me to speak these words now
Another day here hasn't been promised to me, don't you agree
That you never fail when you try
I'm willing to die but first
I am willing to live, and I overstand that this will be
A lifelong sacrifice
in order to reveal
You gon' have to destroy
and if you ain't thinkin right
You damn sure can't act right
somebody raise your fist
And let me know I'm not alone
revolution, doesn't mean fightin
In these streets
and it ain't gonna be no revolution
Without the women
and, it ain't gonna be no children
Without the men
and, you can't have no love without the trust
And no
trust can come without communication
And you can't communicate if you ain't got shit to say
You can't teach about what you, been deceived about too
Any book you read is still limited education
You gon' have to talk to God personally
and time is short
And, he's on his way,
I will receive a great reward for what I've done
And this is all that really matters to me
In time you will see what I told you is true
And I ain't have to rhyme to say that to you
I ain't got to rhyme to say it to you, it's true
