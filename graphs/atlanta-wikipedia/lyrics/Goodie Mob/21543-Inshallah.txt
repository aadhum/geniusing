How can I promise you forever
When I can't even promise the rest of the day
Inshallah
Dialect kinda slurred
Did you catch that word blurred
Talk slow, walk slow
In a country run by a president
That doesn't know a single resident
In my 'hood
So just row
Your little boat down the stream
But go slow
Cause life is only a dream
And if I should die before I awake
I leave to all my beloved this message to take
The beneficient
The merciful
Lord of worlds
Master of the days of judgement
Guide me on a path
Upon those whom you bestowed your favors
Not upon those whom your wrath is brought down
Nor upon those that go astray, after hearing your teachings
Never abandon your Emmanuel
For want of religion
