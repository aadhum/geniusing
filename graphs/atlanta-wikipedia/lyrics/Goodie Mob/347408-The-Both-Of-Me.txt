[Big Fraze]
You turn the other cheek
trynna save face
A black man and "real nigga" ain't the same race
Yeah, a black man and "real nigga" ain't the same race
Trynna hit the finish line in the same race
Race to the finish line, see the game face
While a "real nigga" seems to have more hate
A black man keeps his run at a steady pace
Yeah, that's like the tortuous and the hare
A black man save it, a "nigga" throw it in the air
Don't get me wrong, I done kept it real, nigga
Until my daddy told me 'bout a cotton field
That my granddaddy picked 'till the day that he was killed, nigga
By a white man
what a real "nigga"
A "real nigga" do a deal for some crumbs
A black man will sign a "nigga" cause he dumb
A nigga get cash, a man get a check
A nigga think now while a man think next
Jesus was a black man, Judas was a "nigga"
Society has taught us that "You is just a nigga"
But I refuse to believe that
And I refuse to believe that
