And it doesn't pertain to all black women
Yo, I'm quite single, and occassionally I mingle
But aside from all the rest, she sparks my interest
No, ma'am, I don't know you
Just offering the common respect I feel I owe you
Also, some conversation, companionship, common-ground and common-sense
There's no such thing as coincidence in, me finding you here
And I really hate screaming in your ear, so some other time, OK?
I waited a day *phone rings* Hello?
This is Carlito from a couple of days ago, you sound tired
Forgive me if I've called you too late
But what better time to relate mind-state?
Where could I begin?
Hasn't anyone ever told you you got beautiful skin?
You're more than welcome, what do you desire within?
living and learning are our only obligations
Equality, honesty, independence, intelligence, emotion and devotion
Humbly seeking to hear God when he's speaking
At one time, my mind, just, couldn't conceive
A woman had to dress a certain way to believe
But, in the same breath, a-llow me to say
That, if you believed young lady, you wouldn't dress that way
And I, was attracted to your class, I couldn't see all yo' ass
And, I was very content, and you deserved every complement
And Love, when I look at you, I see my reflection
So I offer my love, affection and protection
There's no me if there is no you
Kinda thought you was slick in the beginnin'
teurned
hope
To discuss distrust amongst the so-called
Good in every wo-man, how I wish this was true
I deal with facts only
already done cloned me
Why I sang the blues, when there's only one God
That watches over our every step, I need his help
When I'm walkin, lookin for the right female
I can't tell sometimes
They tell me the devil's comin humble in his approach
