Sometimes words are enough to kill over
Thanksgiving didn't give
So what should I hope for
I keep on looking fo job
But job seems not to like me
What else my door's kick off the hinges
Somebody just fill they Christmas list
Off me and tha family
And damn I just miss them
Felt like I've been raped
A figures been through my drawers
Always read tha times in between tha black
Spent my summers in that country
So I consider myself a Jack
Some left this world by putting bullets in they head
But little Johnnie across the street
Hung hisself from his bunk-bed
Had to go to court in tha mornin'
Nothing hard about it
My little partner was just scared
How scared Gipp that scared
When I was B-gee
None of my homies carried guns
All I had was a stick
Coming out hard was the way from day one
One of the smallest muthafuckers in the crew
But you knew and feel the type of niggas that kill
Be the ones that's out to prove something
To them other niggers cause
They already know the outcome
What's going down at the party
So many fine hoes nobody knows why
We buck, I guess we up in a rut
Looking for but at the same time
Up in the Flame supporting girls up in the game
Out to get a piece of what the system
Has designed black folks to struggle for
red Fred Sanford truck undercover
Um to mad to be scared
So for the price if you go it
Fred Stock
Benjamin Mays
Maybe it's a test that we all gotta pass
Alone in the cold on my way to be degraded
For a fee to help get my family off this streeet called Sesame
