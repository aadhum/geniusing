I was that cool motherfucker
But living in the world of these cruel motherfuckers
Society done made me a fool motherfucker
And sixteen shots leaving the pussies taking cover
The fucking grave by twenty one is so likely
Fuck the system the DEA sellin all the damn yay
So I pray that them fuckers die
And when they leave let them pussy motherfuckers fry
And make they families eternally have to cry
the n ride
Them crackers had me fucked up I scooped a job for a min
But couldn't deal with the pay I quit that shit in a day
Back on the grind servin my yay nothing to say
