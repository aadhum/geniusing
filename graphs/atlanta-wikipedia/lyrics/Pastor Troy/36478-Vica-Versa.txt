Yeah (yeah)
This song here is called Goddamn, Vice Versa
(I'm doin' my best to save my people)
(The people and I will rely on God)
Picture everything that you thought was good, was really bad
Everything bad, was really good
(What if Heaven was on Earth nigga)
The whole world, vice versa
(Good is bad)
Vice versa (Bad is good)
(Hell on Earth nigga)
This shit here, Goddamn, go on
Go on and get you a mother fuckin' fat ass blunt of that 'dro
Smoke that shit
What if Heaven was Hell and vice versa?
If I told you go to Hell, would you tell I cursed ya?
I wanna make you use your mind,
And when you listen to these rhymes, nigga take your time
Again I ask, Heaven was Hell and vice versa
Would you start doing evil in order to nurture the spirit man?
Do you understand that there's a war?
It's ragin' on
and the devil got some ammo too
Don't get me wrong,
but I put my trust off in the Lord
I give a fuck,
Heaven was Hell and vice versa,
I have no fear
I done witnessed too much Hell right here
lend me your ear
Recall the beer we had to pour
For all our niggas,
hit the Devil with the .44
Payback nigga!
My liquor keep me from tryin' to enter battle alone
And to deal with all this wickedness, I smoke a zone
It's vica versa so I guess I'll beg Satan to save me
God I'm confused, the feuds of all these motherfuckers, makin' me sick
*Virgin Mary never fucked nobody, but she suck dick
With a clique of nasty concubines, and vice versa
I don't know where I'mma go this Christmas, it's Satan's birth
I'mma try to smoke a pound of weed, and ease the Earth
While Jesus equipped with angels,
the Devil's equipped with fire
For God so love the world that he blessed the thug with
rock
Who's the Devil may I ask?, It's so polluted
Uprooted from all this stupid shit
Elated that they gon' go to Heaven
But do they know Heaven may not be the place to go?
If this was vice versa, I'd be an angel, cause I'm a devil
A Down South Georgia Rebel, a whole 'nother fuckin' level
Bustin' caps and splittin' wigs
Heaven or Hell, where do we go
When we die, eternal fire or the streets of gold?
Only God knows, vice versa
