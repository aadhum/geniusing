What's up, big mouth, you still talkin' huh
Pastor, blast ya, okay, and well uh huh
This for, all those, niggas, that talk the talk
Fuck nigga, I walk the walk, don't make me get my assault
No charge if I get caught, I am connected
Got this rap game on lock, hell yeah perfected
Y'all nigga's pathetic, come around with that bullshit
Fuck around and get gunned down, playin around in my pulpit
Soon as I pulled it, they'll say he's deadly
Hell yeah, you got that right, nigga I'm ready
My AR-15 up on my arm
And fuck them weak ass niggas
