When it comes to relationships, I know I can't hold on
It might come off selfish, rather chase money, baby I'm gone (Yeah, Yeah)
It can't be no other way
Was talking to my ex just the other day
It's crazy how the love just fade away
But I cannot trip, I got a grip
I will not stop until I get the chair
I am King Slum remember the name
I am King Slum remember the name
I said I am King Slum remember the name
Yeah (Slum Caesar, Slum Caesar)
You welcome
