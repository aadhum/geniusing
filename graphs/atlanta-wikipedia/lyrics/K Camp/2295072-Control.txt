[Intro: K Camp's dad]
When you were growing up, I missed the laughs, I missed the fun
Every time you left heading to ATL, I felt undone
Sometimes I wanted to talk, but hustlin' took its toll
Damn near gave the streets my soul
I will never be able to replace the time lost
Bein' a daddy and not a father is a hell of a cost
A big piece of me is you
As I reflect the man in the mirror, he gets so clearer
[Verse 1]
Feel like I got a lot of people that's depending on me
Built a solid foundation, put the building on me
I remember how it felt when my tank was on E
I remember how it felt when the money was low
Dirty dishes in the sink, mouse traps on the floor
Love the feeling I can finally tell my momma I got it
[Outro: K Camp's mom]
