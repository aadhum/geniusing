[Hook: T.I.]
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I'm ridin' dirty with (ya dig it now?)
This that trap music, urban legend
Bitch I'm a urban legend, carry 'round a Smith N Wesson
Went from rag to riches now I keep them bankrolls in my jeans
Drag racin' on Peachtree, that's some shit that you've never seen
Now I'm here with the king
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I'm ridin' dirty with (ya dig it now?)
I shoot that hoe with the .44 I'm ridin' dirty with (ya dig it now?)
