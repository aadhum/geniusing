My shawtys so underrated
My shawtys so underrated
When you wake  up in the morning
I see it in your eyes that you know it
These niggas sleeping on you
These niggas sleeping on you
When you look at yourself in the mirror
I know it don't get much clearer
That these niggas sleeping on you
These niggas sleeping on you
Chillin at the house with your boy shorts on
With that ass hanging out, can't do nun wrong
All in the kitchen, whippin the chicken
Twerk while you cook, let me grab my phone
Let me record you, letting you know I adore you
The broke niggas they can't afford you
Most of them niggas they boring you
And I know
