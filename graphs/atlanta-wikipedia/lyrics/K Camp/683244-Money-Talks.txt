Nigga, money talks, money talks, nigga, money talks
Money talks, money talks, aye, nigga, money talks
Money talks, nigga, money talks
Money talks, money talks, yeeeeah
Money talks, money talks, nigga, money talks
If you talkin' 'bout that money, we can talk
Young nigga, money talks, money, money talks, money talks
Aye, money talks
Catch me in the latest fashion, sorry I don't wear that
If you ain't talkin' money, keep it movin' just like FedEx
Playin' in that two door, I just had to drop the roof
Ho I want them Benjis, no I can't be friendly
