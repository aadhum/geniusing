Your bitch done bounced on more wood, than a fuckin' spalding, ball
My nigga's, they been down since day one, on my side like kidneys
If you with that goofy shit, just take a trip to Disney
My bitch asks me who I love, I said the studio
I cannot remain faithful, all these groupie ho's
She just keep that good brain, medulla oblongata
Smokin' doobies with your bitch, let get that understood
[?] Turn a ho, so lord
Y'all already know what time it is me K Camp
