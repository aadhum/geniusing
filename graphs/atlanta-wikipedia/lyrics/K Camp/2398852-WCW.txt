That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything's new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
That's my boo
I'ma make sure everything's new
I'ma put her in a brand new coupe
Flew her in the city, had to show her how I live
We can skip the talkin', straight to fuckin' if you wanna
