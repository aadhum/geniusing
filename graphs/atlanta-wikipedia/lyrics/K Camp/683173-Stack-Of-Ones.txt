If you searchin' for the one, I'm the real thing
Tell me what you really know about sacrifice
Kush got me in the air like a trampoline
Lord watch over me, I ain't livin' right
Used to dream 'bout these days that I'm livin' now
I appreciate all of my brothers
Gotta know I made room at the dinner table
They was here when the boy had nothin'
It's only right that we ball 'til we're unstable
Give it to you ass direct, you don't need cable
I'm a young player comin' from the best side
Shout out [?] on the west side
We can ride through the city with the roof missin'
You can tell them other bitches they can mind their business
Deep down, man they just wanna be you
You ever threw a stack of ones out the sunroof?
Plenty try to imitate but let me demonstrate
