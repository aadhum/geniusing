Let me tell you what a nigga told me
Expect nothing don't nobody owe me
Grinding for the check I hustle like Ginobili
So if you talking money you gone have  to show me
I’mma turn up for a check
I’mma pull up in that vet
Make these bitches break they neck
Y'all gone give me my respect
I’mma turn up for a check
I’mma pull up in that vet
Make these bitches break they neck
Y'all gone give me my respect
Look I live my life smoke this weed
And do what the fuck I wanna
Ya’ll gone give it to me or I'mma take it
Boy I am legend like will
