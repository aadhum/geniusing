Work man, work! Fuck you wanna be on the streets talkin' about what you do for, and you ain’t doin' it. Fuck you wanna be in the club looking like you do somethin' for, an you don’t really do it. Fuck you wanna stand next to a nigga like me that really do it, and you don’t do it. The fuck from about me. Feel me? I gotta beautiful bitch next to me!
I got hoes, I got stripes
Any means, say cheese, heard they snitchin', that's a rat
Just fuckin' up the game, that's a mothafuckin' fact
Hitters comin' from the front, hitters comin' from the back
I'm just comin' for a sack
Had to shine, from the grind, I'm like Dion in his prime
Money baby, money baby, money-
Ay shit, you know all night, all night, but, ay mane look, Shit you know I don't really have nothin', but I been workin' in these streets mane i'm tryna see how much you charge for a feature, but i don't really have shit you know what i'm sayin', but if you give me this opportunity i promise bruh-
You can have to call Shep my nigga
Ay mane, that money talks
