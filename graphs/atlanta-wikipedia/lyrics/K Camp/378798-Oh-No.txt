I can’t trust these niggas, I can’t trust these hoes
I can tell I got these haters pissed, I know, I know
I don’t give a damn about none of these niggas
I don’t give a damn about none of these bitches
I don’t give a damn about none of these niggas
I don’t give a damn about none of these bitches
I don’t give a damn about none of these niggas
I don’t give a damn about none of these bitches
I don’t give a damn about none of these niggas
I don’t give a damn about none of these bitches
I hear what they’re talkin’, I know what they’re sayin’
But nigga I ain’t worried about shit, shit
Ridin' 5 deep in that tahoe
Bitches keep talkin’, they’re runnin’they mouth
But we know that you ain’t about action
She let me beat it, Mike Jackson
Nigga we eatin', you snackin'
In the cut with your bitch, relaxin'
Mama Said Chase That Dough (Doe)
