Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake
You know a young nigga too smooth like butter
Making all the plays, you can come join the huddle
I ain't saying shit like a dog with a muzzle
Figured out the game, got the pieces to the puzzle
Got a new bitch, she ain't got no standards
Magic City Monday, baby welcome to Atlanta
Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake
Claiming you gon' ride, baby you just got to prove it
Sipping on that purple drank, got 'em moving slow
Something 'bout her got me feeling this way
Out here hustling, I'm just trying to maintain
It's not my birthday but I'm all over that cake
