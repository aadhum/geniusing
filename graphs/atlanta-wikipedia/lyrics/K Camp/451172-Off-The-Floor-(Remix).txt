[Hook: K CAMP]
I been getting money I ain't worried 'bout a ho'
You better check your bitch cause she been creeping on the low
No matter the occasion I'ma always get the dough
Throw it at the strippers watch 'em get it off the flo'
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, I ain't worried bout a ho'
I been getting money, I been I been getting money
I been getting money, watch 'em get it off the flo'

[Verse 1: K CAMP]
I been getting money I ain't worried bout a ho'
Know niggas with the white call it Marilyn Monroe
No need to spit the game because I had her at Hello
But she always bitching cause I'm in the studio
Hopscotch the pussy so you know I'm in and out
I scramble for the cheese like I work at Waffle House
The game needs change and i found it in the couch
I swear these niggas trash they remind me of the grouch
Hold up, wait a second, I'm gone!
I'ma sprint to the bill like a phone
Raise your hand if you getting that paper
Or you want that shit like foams
I'ma north side nigga, rep your zone
Fuck your rules, I'm grown
You better check your ho cause last night she ain't even come home

[Hook]
I been getting tour, fuck what them niggas think
Niggas been talkin' slick, but niggas belly in the bank
But when you getting money, everybody act the same
And this Rollie, make it look like you got a lotto on yo' face
So a few of them is cool, but a lot a them is fake
And sorry money talk, and I got a lot a shit to say
No not you, quiet, move
Yeah, y'all niggas be going to soft
Bitch, I been a rider since day one, niggas go hard
I'mma in this at all time's
Step in and I might go off
Bitch, I know some najes, that'll ride for some phone calls (ride)
