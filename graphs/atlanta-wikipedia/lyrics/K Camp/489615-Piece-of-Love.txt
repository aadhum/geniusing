I know your patience short of that bull
But let me holla at you for a minute
Picture us on sunset
With that passengers side with you in it
Hair blowing in the wind
Carefree from your issues
The ex man he a fool
I know he mad that he dissed you
Now you moved on to the next chapter
Trynna figure out what's next
