Used to pull up in the four door Honda
With my nigga Yayo with the black door
Henny to the brim got my vision too blurry
You know I keep three like my name Steph Curry
Sonnin' these niggas like an episode of Murry
If you running for the money, motherfuckers better hurry
Shout out Diego, stacking like Legos
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
I make money every day, young nigga came a long way
I ain't make the game my play
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
Look at all the money I made
