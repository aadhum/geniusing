A lot of niggas saying that they are the realest
But if you are the realest, who the hell am I?
Hear these niggas out here talking like they killers
The same ones who scared to put that on they life
I ain't trying to impress nobody
I'm the type to go smoke a blunt
And if I'm high enough I might sip the syrup
mast
from
Bitches and money tear niggas apart
I been this way from the start
these
I'm just gon' ride for my niggas
I'm down to die for my niggas
Because you come up and holla
That don't make you my nigga
It's on you if you ain't 'bout that action, then why the fuck you lie?
I'm the type to put my niggas on
I'm the type that want to see you rich
You the type to go blow your check
Just for Instagram and a sneaky bitch
Done turned the mansion to a damn zoo
