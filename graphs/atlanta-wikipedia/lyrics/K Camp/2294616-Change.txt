[Verse 1: K Camp]
I was six years old
Riding shotgun in an old school with my dad
Memories that I hold on to
Cause really those the only ones that I had
They used to call me Lil' Rock
47th and Lloyd, first time I got jumped on the porch
Hit the oldest one with the one two, bink bink
Other one ran up, left him right there on the porch
Hell is you saying? Lil Jeff turned me into a man
That was big bro, that was big cuz
Everything to a nigga now he gone
Guess God had a plan I don't understand
I'm here to stay and I'ma do it for my city like the mayor
Real northside nigga
I keep cheese like Fellini's
Back in the day I used to be a hot head
Like I'm walkin' 'round with a beanie
In the middle of the summer
I'm just tryna score, nigga, no time to fumble
Same lil nigga that they said wasn't gon' be the shit
Is the shit, who knew
What's the point of pushing that whip
If you ain't changing lanes?
What's the point of having many girls
If your bitch don't change?
What's the point of staying the same
If everything around you change?
