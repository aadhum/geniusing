Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
She know when I call it's for a reason, so come through
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
Ain't too many loyal niggas, I just know a few
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
Used to keep money in a shoe box
Now I'm pulling up like tube socks
Went from a dollar to a few knots
Remember long talks with my big bruh Cam
Young wild niggas in bend selling grams
Man the pain and the struggle, man, that made me who I am
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
Jumped off that porch, I changed my mindset and my view
Reasons why you hate to see me win, I wished I knew
Came straight out that mud
You just don't know what I've been through
Look really no time for the talk, nigga I ain't got free time
Now-a-days I be all over green like the mothafuckin' d-line
And I ain't got time for the hoe when I barely got me time
Just give me a blunt and booth, mothafucka I'll be fine
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
Trill OG
Smoking on me some killer kush
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
I can see they watching, counting pockets, but what's new?
Nothing 'bout me change except these bitches n that coupe
I'm telling nothing but the truth
Rather get this money, I got nothing else to do
