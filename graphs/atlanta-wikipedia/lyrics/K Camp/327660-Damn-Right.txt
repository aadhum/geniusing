I can see the money coming with my eyes close (Damn Right)
When it comes to that grind nigga anythang goes (I know u feel me Damn Right)
I'ma always get that dough (Damn Right)
I'm trying get it back you know (Damn Right)
I'm worth a Mil on the low (Damn Right)

Ok it started with a nigga that just had them hoop dreams
Then I fell in love with music I was only 13
Grab the mic started flowing plenty doubted I kept going
Plenty years in that booth perfecting craft I had to show em
It ain't happen overnight man this shit took sometime
Stayed focus had a dream then I hit them billboards
And I'm only getting started I gotta plan nigga what's yours
(4real)
Yo ho gone let me slide through don't need no visa
