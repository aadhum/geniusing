I live my life with no regret
I asked them was I a friend
I don't know bout you, I've been betrayed
Steal from your own partners that's a trait of a bitch
But I'm over that
Life too short like a skit
I told my mama please be patient with me
I'mma win, I know, I put you through that bull
Don't know where to begin
You sacrifice, to quit your job to help me chase my dream
Strong, black, beautiful queen
You get my respect and I love you
until I'm gone
I'm gonna say this, "R.I.P Lil Jeff!"
I swear to God your truly missed
Go back on that day I never cried so much in life
It's gone be alright
Swear I talk to him every night, amen
I ain't have a penny, they still left me in the slump
