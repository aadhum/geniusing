Ay, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, leggo, leggo, what you doin'?
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked
Four bad bitches, man, the pleasure all mine
We ain't doin' nothin', tryna to have a good time
Roll around the city, Porsche seats on recline
Four bad bitches fuckin' at the same time
Two hands on the ball, shawty just doubled
Once I get mine I ain't even tryna cuddle
All in the party, hippy trippy on the Henny
Jar full of weed, baby girl, I got plenty
Shawty, where the shots? I need many, many, many
Molly in the system, drinking'out the bottle
Shawty, goin' in, goin' hard full throttle
Instagram likes got her feelin' like a model
If you lookin' for the drugs, don't worry I got 'em
Ay, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, leggo, leggo, what you doin'?
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked
No Janet Jackson, don't fuck with no penny's
Ay, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked up, drink a little bit
Smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
We ain't doin' much tryna have a good time
Got four bad bitches, man, the pleasures all mine
Girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Gir-girls kissin' girls, best believe they all fine
Leggo, leggo, leggo, leggo, what you doin'?
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit, ayy, get fucked up
Drink a little bit, smoke a little bit, pop a little bit
Ayy, get fucked
