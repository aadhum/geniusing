[Hook: K Camp]
Them niggas ain't with my niggas (no way)
Imma go to war with my niggas (okay)
If it goes down , imma ride witcha (you straight ?)
I got love for all my bitches
[Verse 1: K Camp]
[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
They don't live like my nigga
I'll kill like my nigga
Ride or die like my nigga
Homicide like my nigga
I ride for you , you ride for me
You drank the brew I like the weed
If you see ah nigga talking to the police (shit)
Niggas ain't with my niggas
They can't be
Lost both of my close friends
Shit hits the fan
My click appear
Get out the V.I.P
Look funny and dey pants too damn tight
