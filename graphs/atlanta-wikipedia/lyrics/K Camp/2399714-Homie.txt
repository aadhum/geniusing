[Intro]
Look you knew I wasn't shit
You know I ain't shit
You still my homie though
You hate the fact I'm on the road
You know that's where that money at
You always bitching when I'm gone
But smiling when I bring it back
Complaining bout them other bitches
Cos they ain't worried bout you
Them other bitches temporary
But if you act up you too
If you fuck with me like I fuck with you
You know the truth (you know)
I just wanna kick it, smoke a blunt and grab some lunch
You just wanna argue play around with mixed emotions
And I ain't got the patience cos a young nigga focused
You gon' always be my shorty
You gon' always be my shooter
You gon' always be my homie
You gon' always be my partner
Anything you need I got ya
Just don't wanna see you, lonely
Yeah (x8) you gon' always be my homie
Yeah (x7) you gon' always be my..
