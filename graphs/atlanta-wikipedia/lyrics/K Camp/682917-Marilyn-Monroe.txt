She fell in love with the life
The money first
She gon play
With your heart
She make it worst
I salute the things you do to make it work
But tonight it don't matter
Aight, what should I say about this motherfucka?
He tryna slick play like, we tryna fuck but
I don't know
I mean, I'm not tripping because I want the same thing
However, I don't know I think Imma make him wait, hmm
I know I can't wait too long
However, I just, I don't know
I'm not ready
I don't wanna him to have it too easy
What do you think?
What should you I do?
