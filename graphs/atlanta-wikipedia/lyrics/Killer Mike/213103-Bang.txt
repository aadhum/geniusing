Driving like a bat out of hell in a red
Caprice classic,
God in the building, nigga, ain't no comparison
Fired my boss, I don't need no sponsor
Truck jewelry got me looking tough like Tonka
Robber try to touch, lose his arm like in Rwanda
In the concrete jungle, you prey or a hunter
When you kill a nigga, they say his soul haunts ya
I'd rather sleep with a ghost than sleep with the fish
Be judged by twelve, than carried by six
Forty-five got the king size jeans on sag
Charging with the hemi going vroom vroom fast
No love for the haters you can kiss my ass
Dope-ass flows, lyrically, I'm cocaine
Dope dick for the bitches, dope lyrics for the dope mang
King Kong is the beast man, no cage, no chain
Top of the world, white girl in my left hand
Some monkey-ass niggas better hear me, clearly
I'm talking weekly, monthly, yearly
I have his momma saying "No, take me lord!"
Preacher in the pulpit, the choir sings
And on the first row a momma cries and leans
