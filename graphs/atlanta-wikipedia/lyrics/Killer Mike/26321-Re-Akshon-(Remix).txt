Aye, aye Bun who did this man?
So you mean you got, T.I.P., Killer Mike, Lil Jon and Bun B
So that's the King of the South.. the Underground King..
The King of Crunk.. and King Kong all on the same song
Haha.. aye Jon, they ain't ready
We taking it on back to the trap my nigga!
I got the weed in my sack - smokin on that killa!
In the hood where I'm at - trappin with my niggas!
I'm finna pull this heat and have you fetal like a new-born
T.I.P., Mike, and Bun B - scared whatchu better be
We was just the kings, now we heads of a legacy
Leaders of the new south, fake niggas move out
He talkin loud and proud, but he scared with a tool out
Can't keep playin both sides of the fence, you got to choose now
The realest of the real or the fakest of the fake
And we gon' show them people what it really is in the A
Straight from Atlanta, the hog hand-ler
I'll drag 'em threw the river like a bad yellow nigga
Bitch I'm coming live from the trunk and I thrive on the funk
Cuz I'd rather die like a man than survive like a punk
I'm no coward, I'm 'dro-powered, you gettin Twin-Towered
Devoured - it's a shit-storm and you bout to get showered
From Broward county to Harris, Pasadena to Paris
Cuz there is, now way now how - I stay low-key, low-brow
In that black on black on black in the 'lac cuz I'm so wild
I get, drunk off that, I'll be high off this
I might pop one of those, it don't matter my nigga - I don't miss
