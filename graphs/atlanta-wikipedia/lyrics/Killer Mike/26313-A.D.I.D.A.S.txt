All day I dream about
All day I dream about sex
'65 Chevrolet Impala peachy cream
Cruising down the street like two fingers
Talking bout meeting at the MC room
On the inside of the ship
Not a honey dip to hunt on
Or the Blue Man Group
Caught out on the Vegas Strip
Boss lips, legs, arms, necks
Hip dips, hair net, mo' stretch
a camel toe
30 some seconds I can't stop it
Heffers call me Black-N-Decker, I don't screw them hoes I drill
I've been cuttin' cute lil' coochies since before the record deal
Catch me daydreamin' 'bout them, thick, medium, or slim
Puerto Ricans call it chocha
Nathaniel
likes his white, I like mine dark as cola
It's the first thing on my mind in the morn' when I roll over
All men young or old in the end it's what we after
Even my grandpappy's happy, he got prescribed Viagra
Grandaddy, grandaddy what's happenin'
What's up, what's up this me
Hey let me get about three of them blue diamonds
When I drill, I don't spill, even if she's on the pill
Keep my weapon covered, concealed, and in a shield
Cause I don't need that A.I.D.S
A D. and an A. missin' out my Adidas
On the down low, like R. Kelly and youngsters
But over eighteen only cause baby I'm no perv
jumping brooms
Verse 4: Big Boi]
jump the broom
