All we do is fuck, fight, and get X'ed up
In combat, sweet agony upon that
I deliver, make you take it soft and break it hard
Like dope dealers,
My pretty little vampire, my delila
Teach me how to hate the truth and how to love a liar
You a malicious mind-bending Mary Magdalene
You're my path to the pen or the crazy house
Everytime I beat it down, it jumps wetter
Like a dark cloud, bringing me pain and bad weather
I remain inside of your rain with no umbrella
Til death do us part, we deserve to be together
Ike and Tina, our love is measured on a milimeter
