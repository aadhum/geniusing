There's 8 million stories in the City of Dope
I'mma just tell you about a few I know
I left in an '85 regal just turning the Pac up
And what?
Me and her watching Belly and shit
And she rubbing my belly and shit
Whispering this shit, like:
(Hey Mike how you pay this bitch
How you act like you ain't the one with a dick
The drop on? You got three points left
Now how you gonna let that bitch ball and stunt?
Shit, I might as well fuck the dyke bitch myself
Get my hands on all of that there white myself)
The fat bitch catfished, yeah she took bait
Set up a rendezvous with my boo at eight
Went to Black, told her "Baby we straight
Let her eat it 'til she sleeping then open the door
She gonna awake to duct tape, face down on the floor"
Told her "Bitch, God said don't covet your neighbor
You dance with the Devil, you will be disabled
Bitch, I'm a beast and this my bishe
All we do is walk the earth and eat the weak"
She said "Mike how you gon' do this shit to me?
We been doing good business since at least '03"
I told her "Bitch, be a man, this is M.O.B."
The dumb dyke began to lick cause she thought it was a dick
