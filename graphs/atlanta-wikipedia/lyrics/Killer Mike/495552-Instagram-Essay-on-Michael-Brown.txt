human
We deserve to be buried by our children not the other way around.
look at this Mother and look at this father and tell me as a human being how u cannot feel empathy for them.
How can u not feel sympathy for their pain and loss.
These are not "THOTS, niggas/niggers, hoes, Ballers, Divas.
and that child was slaughtered like Game
and left face down as public spectacle while his blood drained down the street.
Don't insert your agenda. Save me the bullshit Black On Black Crime speech and look at these to Noble creatures called humans and look at what govt sanctioned murder has done.
I don't care if others rioted or why.
I care that we as humans care as much about one another more.
I care we see past Class, race and culture and honor the humanity that unites our species.
Stop talking and LOOK at these PEOPLE. LOOK at these HUMANS
and stand with them against a system allows a Human PIG to slaughter their child.
