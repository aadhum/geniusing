I just squoze up out the Camero
I'm looking fly, how fly? I'm a sparrow
It's real G, ho, to the bone marrow
tomarrow
You rap good? Put a bullet through your *vocal* chords
You sweet, Kool Aid, straight Hi-C
When I'm high, I swear I could see the G-O-D
Heaven in the mirror: I'm just seeing me..
I had scholarships still: went to Moorehouse
