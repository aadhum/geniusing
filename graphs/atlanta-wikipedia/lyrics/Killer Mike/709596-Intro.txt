And if you familiar with the Grind, you know we don't have fans
We only have supporters
And I say we have supporters because it takes a lot
To dig in your pocket or dig in your purse
And break bread with fifteen or twenty dollars to buy a record
I believe when you buy a record you should leave that record with something more than a bullshit experience
A lot of suckers out here trying to sell you music
Sell you a story that they want you to believe is true
And at the end of the story, nothing happens
But the same old shit that was happening before
If you have a boss, maybe you should fire your boss (Maybe you should)
Maybe you should change your life (That's maybe)
Your work ethic will determine your worth
Meaning whatever you get is determined by how hard you work to get it
