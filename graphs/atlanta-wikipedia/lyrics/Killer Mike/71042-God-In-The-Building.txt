It's hot like Hell in the south
It feel like we in the devil mouth in the south
hopping out
A â€˜73 Impala with the brains blowed out
I'm from Martin Luther King, respect it it's holy ground
Who'd have thought a nigga out a shotgun house
Would ever drive a car with a angel that bow
I'm the shit cause I come from the bowels
The guts of the city, ain't a nigga fucking with me
Young player from the South, tell stories like Biggie
Take the King's English, paint pictures so vivid
That the listener will swear to God they lived it
If Jesus came back, Mother, where you think he'd be?
Probably in these streets with me
Keep a Jesus piece to protect myself
If heaven got a ghetto you can bet I'll be there
But before I be a servant in white heaven I will rule in a black hell
Living reckless for a necklace and big chain
Young Achilles, nigga, I will kill these niggas
No homo, I just don't feel these niggas
Laid back seeing panoramic views
It's a angelic view, the sky so blue
Similar to my diamonds and they hue
