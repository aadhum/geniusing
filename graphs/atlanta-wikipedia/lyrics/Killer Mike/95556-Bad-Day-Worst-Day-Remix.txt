Don't confuse it with C. Delores Tucker
Kobe the best player ever, wit' NO game
Fell for the trick of that white bitch, so lame
We went from Farrakhan to Don Juan
I'd NEVER give a dollar, to the good doctor - Reverend Creflo Dollar
Me and Hitler got the same damn birthday
You white motherfuckers move slow as Bob Cousy
