You've got it stuck in your brain that I murdered somebody. What do you want to call me a murderer for? I've never killed anyone. I don't need to kill anyone. I think it. I have it HERE
I entered the facility a drug dealer
One month in a nigga tried me now I'm a killer
Unh-unh
Outlawed by birth
And I'm an outlaw every day until they put me in the dirt
You people have done everything in the world to me
Doesn't that give me equal right?
I could do anything I want to you people
Any time I want to
Because that's what you've done to me!
If you spit in my face,  slap me in my mouth
Throw me in solitary confinement for nothing
What do you think I'm going to do when I get out of here?
Cause I rebelled, they Guantanamo Bay'd me
The latrine is my world. I don't pretend to go uptown and be anything fancy.  I can, but I find more real in the world that I'm in,  than I do the tinsel, and the real world is the one I have to deal with everyday.  Believe me, if I started murdering people... there'd be none of you left
