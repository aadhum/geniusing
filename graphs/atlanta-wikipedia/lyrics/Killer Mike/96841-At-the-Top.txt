I'm sittin' at the top, I got a bird's eye view
Downtown condo purchased by the birds I flew
Actually I purchased this with the words I drew
Reminiscin' on the days when the birds I flew
Life's a cold bitch but I ain't ever trying to leave her
I'mma get them dollars, pour bottles and fuck some models
Write a song about it, do the same shit tomorrow
Till I'm sitting on top like a Braves fitted cap
Tell 'em see y'all in the morning ladies I got shit to do
Then it's back to the money, to the hustle and the griz-ind
If a bitch think she trumps that she's out her motherfucking miz-zind
Now these bitches sweating me on MTV and re-runs
Now them hoes is lucky to get in the club that we run
New woman wit' me flew in from Cali but she from England
She model, pretty, long black hair, and do some singin'
She better than whoever but never had a hit record
She wanna get together and get married forever
I thought about Kelis and said no bitch I'm 'bout my cheddar
