I will die a legend like Notorious
Fat fly boy, young Notorious
I'm a E.V., educated villain
Triple bang and salute when the gang see him
Yeah, I said I Get-Rich-IN-D
Trill definition of that G.R.I.N.D
Because Malik, Aniyah, Pony, Mike have gotta eat
Here come the blues, nigga!
Young Muddy Waters
In the club sweating hot with your Slutty daughters
Young 8Ball, on my way to legendary
Because the Pimp C in me won't let you pump me
Aye watch your mouth nigga
I'm from the South nigga
And you might smell my cologne at your house nigga
I see you and your new nigga at my show
He love Pledge 2, he love song 4
I love the West side, I love Zone 4
Dixie Hills, Simpson Road that's what I do it for
Martin Luther King, Bankhead and Ashby
But now it's Lowery
I fell off and came up again, I am 50 Cent
I know you don't love me
I'm black and I'm ugly
But I got money, so these fly bitches fuck me
And I got hits now, so you haters can't duck me
My life has turned to magic, this is David Copperfield
But I don't talk 360 unless we talking 'bout a mil
They say I'm underrated and they sorry for my loss
And I reply I'm sorry that y'all broke and got a boss
Pledge 3 is here, I give you the magnum opus
