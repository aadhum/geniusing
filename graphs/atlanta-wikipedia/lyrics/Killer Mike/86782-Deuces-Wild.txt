Look shorty, understand, I heard what yo nigga said
But I'm a grown man, (?), I ain't about playing
I told you, you can have the money, have the car, have the rock
But putting me in the trunk, shit, that's where all that shit stops
That second little nigga must ain't like what I said
'Cus that faggot little fucker hit my fat ass in the head
That's when I realize this little shit about ready to bust
Pupils dilated, and this little fucker geeked on dust
I'm dealing with a greedy junkie with a monkey on his back
Think fast before that junkie monkey go click clack
So I asked the number one, "You got fiends in ya pack?
What kind of glass dick sucking Omar shit is that?
