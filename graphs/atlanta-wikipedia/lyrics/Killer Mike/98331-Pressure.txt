[Malcolm X]
Who are you?
You don't know?
Don't tell me 'Negro'
That's nothing
What were you before the white man named you a 'Negro'?
What was your name?
It couldn't have been 'Smith' or 'Jones' or 'Bush' or 'Powell'
That wasn't your name
They don't have those kind of names where you and I came from
No what was your name?
And why don't you now know what your name was then?
Where was your history?
How did a man wipe out your history?
How did the man, what did the man do to make you as dumb, as you are right now?
Motherfuckas I just bought some new chuckas
The old ones bloodied up from stomping out mo' suckas
Big bad Killa
Big black gorilla
King Kong on you monkey ass niggas
Step and fetch funky ass, flunky ass niggas
Dick in the booty for your Massa' ass niggas
I don't fear no man
Not Bush not Clinton not Osama
Ask your Uncle Thomas how he choose Massa' over Obama
Liberation costs more then a damn dollar
It costs what Christ gave
King gave
X gave
A billion dollars don't make you an ex-slave
Nigga With an Attitude since fifth grade
I never behave
Rather be a dead man than a live slave
We can say what we like
I'm here to deprogram you
Don't forget what they made your great grandmama do
What they made your great granddaddy do
Without a dollar or a penny or a thank you
They'll lock you up, beat you up and work you
Put your life on a thirty year curfew
Little cell little window for you to look through
Even gotta a little chair where he can cook you
Thank God
Our kings had dreams and a big vision
Red Dogs
Ramparts
These pigs going ham sammich
In New York killed a young brother
In Atlanta killed a grandmother
From the black pigs helped 'em kill Sean Bell
Race traitin' bastard, you less than trash
I hope when Jesus come back he murder your ass
So you burn in hell 'til you turn white ash
You a Judas to us, nigga kill yourself
[Malcolm X]
