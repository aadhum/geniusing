Make these niggas get right
Or get low
I know these streets bout tired of this weak shit
Your style been ran through like a freak bitch
Ed Hardy ass nigga and ya sequins
Might as well shop at Victoria Secret
Have 'em gift wrap you some "I love Pink" shit
Rap due and y'all niggas delinquent
You better find another nigga to link with
Cause the nigga you link with is a lie fool
I used to bully that monkey nigga in high school
Sit at the lunch table, steal and eat his damn food
The pretty girls, they say, Michael a damn fool
Grind time, grand hustling for gualla
I remain in the game to break lames off
Some of them sensitive and some too soft
The hood been forced to fuck with y’all by default
But now the truth here the bullshit cuts off
This is real homie, no fake, no filler
One hundred percent grade A killer
Something like the bitch that I keep in Villa Rica
But I’ma be quiet ‘cause they might Mike Vick ya
Some purple kush that'll get me high like a missile
