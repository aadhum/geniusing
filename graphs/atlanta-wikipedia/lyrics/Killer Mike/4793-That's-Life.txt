And I went to fuckin' Morehouse nigga
The fat bitch singing show over, end opera
Leader of the crack Rat Pack, I Sinatra
They say I dissed Oprah
I'm like so what
I never get to jump up and down on a sofa (that's life)
Now watch me as I Cruise like Tom through the slums
Where the education's poor and the children growing dumb
In the section of the city where saditty's don't come
Where Mr. Cosby and Ms. Winfrey won't come
Unless it's a hurricane then FEMA don't come
Coming live from the city where the Dreamer came from
I got violence in my waistband, death in my palm
The Dream died on a balcony, standin' at a hotel
We desegregated - put black with the white
Pipe dreams, crack fiends
Cars look like ice cream
bling-bling
They said be like Mike, so ball nigga
I be havin' conversations with Cornel West
The last great debate I had was with Michael Eric Dyson
You be hard pressed to find another rapper smart as me
Maybe Jay-Z, 2Pac, C-U-B-E
But Oprah'd rather put Superhead on TV
The same white audience that watch Bill O' Reilly
I saw the smirk on they face when you came at Luda
The same nice ladies that forgave Martha Stewart
So I can be a crook
Take money off the books
Just as long as I'm liked by a rich man's wife?
OK, hold up. I can't rap about doing crime
But if I actually do crime, and do time
I can come back out
And have a TV show
With an all white audience
If I rob shareholders of millions?
Niecey had a man, not a mouse or a mole
When the pressure come knockin, I ain't runnin in a hole
George Bush don't like blacks
No shit, Sherlock
And his daddy CIA had flooded the hood with rock
And his momma said the women oughta feel at home
Gettin' raped in the bathroom in the Superdome
The comment Kanye made was damn near right
But Bush hate poor people
Be 'em black or white
b-boys
Robin Hoods
We are the Pied Pipers
