It's hot like Haiti down in Hades
And my redeemer's blood is capable of taking Chris Dudus
Making him a savior of others
The critics ask why Michael never blowed
Well, truthfully I met the Devil at the crossroad
He offered me success in exchange for my soul
He stripped me of my riches, broke me down like Job
First he took my car, and then he took my house
But he couldn't take the Lord's name out a nigga mouth
So then he took my friends, and then he took my fame
And then he had my former friends dirty up my name
And while he was lying/lion I was Daniel in the den
Walking with an angel, a testament to men
My God is amazing, I don't need the Masons
I just need the junkies and the liars and the theives
I need the pimps, prostitues and pushers out the streets
That's where I'm seeking God cuz that's where he found me
That's where I'm seeking God cuz that's where he found me
Because I know God moves through me
God is in me at all given times
