Madden 04
This is the name that came, to alter the game
Two minute drill, we runnin' it mayne
Pushin' ya line, crackin' ya quarterback
Laying that wood, he's flat on his back
Ya receivers is shook, missin' they catch
My receiver's a dog, run and they fetch
No better feeling, then gripping the stick
Returning my punts, nailing my kicks
My runningbacks real, fakin' is sick
HALFBACK, DON'T STOP!
Touchdown bound, Jeff, follow his block
My offensive line, locking the block
Fourth and inches, we can't be stopped
Third and long, we stretching the field
Chasin the corner, see if he chill
It's grime time, let's go
Bringin the pain, I'm laying the wood
Runnin' and gunnin', and stuffin' the hole
Nothin' is realer than 2004!
