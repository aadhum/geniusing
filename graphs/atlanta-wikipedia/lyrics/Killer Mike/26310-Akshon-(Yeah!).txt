Yeah! Killer keeps it honest
Cause reality is perception with a weak stomach
Bubbling uneasy like the bowels of hell (Boo!)
Enough to make a black ghost turn pale
This is the name that came to alter the game
Not like these rappers who spit it the same
Separate lames from they chain
1000 watt amp with woofers in back
Lean to da left if you burning a sac
Baby got back and its in Baby Phat
I like the front but I'm loving the back
I like to bite and I'm hoping she scratch
Escalade dipping I'm holding the lane
Mama's a scholar she blowing my brain
Snapping & Trappin
Ill wit a pill she handle it right
Like Iverson, the smallest thing on the team
But the livest one
Cocked loaded bust like a gun
Y'all better run,
one, one!
Thump, thump, thump, thump (yeah)
All in your trunk (yeah)
Swerving and token and grippin on pine
Woofers and tweeters and speakers and geekers
Crawl in your bunk
Brand new shoes and socks on the Chevy
swerving
gutter fo' show
Racing those candy Sevilles through Dixie Hills
My car do wheelies they drive on three wheels
First round pick like Michael Vick
Quarterback status throw passes at chicks
Santana Moss When catching the ball
Like Moss she catches the ball
Took The Whole World and murdered that shit!
Caught the beat running and dipped with that bitch!
Flipping my words like bricks, trick!
