She ain't like that Bentley, so I bought that hoe a ghost
Molly fool dabbin'
All this Louis V, I feel like Comin' to America
From East Atlanta all the way to Old Nat
She ain't like the rest,
[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
[Verse 3: Young Thug]
I left a girl from Philly, because she gave me no ceilings
[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan]
Get some Kleenex, nigga wipe your nose
Rather stop at Walmart, I don't shop at Target, I might aim on 'em
