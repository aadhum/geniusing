I get my weed from Cali, I get my drank from Texas
First class, flyin' overseas, young nigga just got a passport
I got a K, for the alphabet gangstas tryna make it hard for me to stand up
Have your ass cryin' like the nigga in Boys N The Hood
When 12 said "Hands up"
I get my weed from Cali, I get my drank from Texas
Ugh you stank, Mortal Kombat, kickin' shit in here, mothafucka
Like I'm Liu Kang,
I'm Saddam, but a nigga strapped like Hussein
I get my weed from Cali, I get my drank from Texas
