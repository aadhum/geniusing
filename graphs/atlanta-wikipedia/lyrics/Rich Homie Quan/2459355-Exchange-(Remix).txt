I know everybody then rip this beat
But I'm come with like a whole different approach
Drop down on my knees every night and say a sinner's prayer
Lord please save her for me
Natural, don't do no make up for me
That double cup you know it's waiting for me
Half a pint I poured up
while smoking on Color Purple
In a hotbox with a throwaway
