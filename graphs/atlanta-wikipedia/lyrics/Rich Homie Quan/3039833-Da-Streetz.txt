Zaytoven
I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13
I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14
I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15
And I ain't never go to class as a teen
I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets
17 was the worst, feel like I ain't had no purpose
I keep my phone on silent because it aggravates me
And I protect my paper like it's laminated
Contaminated, I can't even touch the water
I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13
I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14
I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15
And I ain't never go to class as a teen
I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets
Okay, now age 21, I spent locked up
22, came home told myself no more gettin' back locked up
Came home focused, new mind frame, knew nothing could stop us
By 23 my baby momma she was knocked up
Where you think double R come from?
That Royal Rich my second son
My nigga, 'My Nigga,' went platinum, I received me a plaque
I ain't know nothing 'bout no drank until the age of 13
I ain't know nothing 'bout no money 'til the age of 14
I ain't know nothing 'bout no condom 'til the age of 15
And I ain't never go to class as a teen
I ain't dumb, but I ain't know nothing but the streets
