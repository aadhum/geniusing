Go to the spot just to take a shower
I changed clothes, but I ain't been to sleep
I'm on the stage in just like an hour
It day 4, and I ain't been to sleep
That money callin', I can't go to sleep
Them J's call, Can't go to sleep
I'm up nigga I can't go to sleep
And that's because
I'm afraid to go to sleep cause I might die
And, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Can't close my eyes nigga
Open yo eyes nigga
You gotta stay up
Can't go to sleep I'm afraid I might not wake up
Bless me Lord
Watch over my body
Get me through them days
I'ma get this money
Go to sleep; No way
Nah I ain't been to sleep nigga
You can see it in my face
Mama like "get ready for bed"
I'm like "Hell nah I ain't going"
Cause if I sleep then I don't eat
Then I get weak
Then I can't beat these niggas
Kill these niggas, defeat these niggas
Like a main dish I gotta eat these niggas
You know that I be up
