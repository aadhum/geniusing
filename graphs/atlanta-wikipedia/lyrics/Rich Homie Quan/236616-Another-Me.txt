It can't be no other me, establish?
It can't be no another me
It can't be no another me
Can't help how I sound but it can't be no another me
I'm the future, stop comparing us
Ok now he and me, not equal
I got to show all these people
To the critics try to stack it to the ceiling
These are real niggas on some millions
Girl it can't be no other me
I told my baby mama there will never be another me
I smoke good and nigga pound good
