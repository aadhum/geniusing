Walked in the mo'fucker, these pants by nudie
Feelin' like Biggie, this sweater by Coogi
Feelin’ like Izze make a beat in the Jacuzzi
I done smoked to much weed, I’m startin’ to see Illusions
I done fucked too many bitches, hope I ain’t got cooties
Got your bitch watching me, you would swear I was a movie
That purple monster truck it sit up like a dually
Got them purple blunts rolled up, ready to get to it
Got hoes I can expose, but then why would I do it?
(...?...)
She left her last nigga, he didn’t know what he was doing
Even though he had money like a Jew, she ain’t give a fuck
Throw it back, hope you can take this dick
Please be a little slow, okay
she throw it back
Throw it back, throw it back
Throw it back like I’m pitching and you catching (Throw it back)
She say, she don’t fuck with molly but she fell in love with ecstasy
Stupid bitch that’s the same thing
No Bankroll Fresh but I got a bankroll on my homie show you nigga how to do that
She say she ain’t suck dick
Let me call your friend over, bet that bitch show your ass how to do it
rubber
No money machine nigga my hands started hurting, my hands started hurting
Because I’m smacking on a ass, like she ain’t been
She said 'Quan, you ain't gotta cheat when you got me'
'Think about all the bad bitches we could do' (I know x3)
Thought that was your bitch
'Til I took her home, now you got the sad face (I know x3)
Funny, how I'm in the top 5
When last year I was in last place (I know x3)
That, you want me to fail but I’m not gon’ fail because I got God (I know x3)
You be feelin’ freaky girl, all you gotta do is take your clothes of and
