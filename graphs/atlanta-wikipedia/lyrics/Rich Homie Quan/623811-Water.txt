You get a little money, that shit can change you or make you. I ain't spittin' nothin' but facts now. Facts only
I made a lil' money, then I moved my mama
Yeah straight out the hood
I do not have to explain nothin' to you if it's misunderstood
I do not want that lil' average lil' bitch, boy I swear that I'm good
Ride in that Bentley Mulsanne, mothafucka I'm grippin' the wood
Stripes on that 442 Cutly
I just painted the hood
Feelin' like Morgan Freeman leanin' on me, I'm drinkin' the mud
James Brown, he knew what it was
Talkin' 'bout guns, I keep that shit on me, I swear that they're loaded
I stay on molly like coffee, boy I be up like I'm on Folger's
promise
I cannot fuck with you if you start your sentence off with a "cuz"
Thought I would drown in that water, lil' nigga, my head was above
I get my bricks across the water
Diamonds shinin', lookin' just like some water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
My diamonds shinin' like water and that pussy smellin' like water
I do not want that lil' bitch so I let my partner get on her
So many horse got so many 'Raris, like Kentucky Derby
She closin' the curtains
She don't want nobody in her business, she play like she a virgin
She just wanted to take a pic, she wanted to meet me in person
Then 12 pulled me over, I did no complyin'
Got the house on fire just like Andre Rison
I get my bricks across the water
Diamonds shinin', lookin' just like some water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
My diamonds shinin' like water and that pussy smellin' like water
I get my bricks across the water
Diamonds shinin', lookin' just like some water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
Water, water, water
My diamonds shinin' like water and that pussy smellin' like water
