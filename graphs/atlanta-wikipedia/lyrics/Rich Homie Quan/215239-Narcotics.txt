15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I'm the socket and the plug, they watchin' for the drugs
[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Got stack on me, Lil' Ant rest in peace
That's my nigga and a T shirt
Young nigga doin' whatever to get that pack gone
Ever since my nigga died, never be the same on Flat Shoals
Run from twelve and I see the cut
Got 8 thousand plus 7 thousand and that equal what?
15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I'm the socket and the plug, they watchin' for the drugs
True thug can't fold, new money, same ho
I was bored, nothing to do, fucked with a swoop, but I didn't know
I'm drug abusing
That weed baby (that kush)
15 on me long way I got it (I do, I do)
Walkin wit it on me, see it pokin out my pocket
I'm the socket and the plug, they watchin' for the drugs
