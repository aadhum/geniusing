I ain't stun what you saying
All I know is gettin money
Yall niggas be playing, and yall niggas don't want it
Better watch what you saying
Cause my niggas they on it
And my niggas don't play fair
My niggas they don't play fair
Better watch what you saying

Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying
Better watch what you saying

Straight like that (Okay)
