[Verse]
My flow hard to bite for all you stale eaters
And I’m still smart as hell like a Yale teacher
Pneumonia, I’m hot headed, rare fever
Foul call, no foul ball, play fair people
I tell Bone that I’m a young nigga, worth some car lots
Two cell phones and a pistol, I call shots
I’m trippin’ money too, them tall knots
I’m living, doing new things I never thought about
No sick days in my job description, i’m calling off
My ho gone, i’m home alone Macaulay Culkin
How could I know? She ready to go
House full of hoes, reality show
She sat in the ghost, no Casper,  better go faster than it appear
And that’s a Phantom not a real ghost so don’t fear
Double letters on my Rolls Royce, and i’m Ronald Reagan of that building, bitch
Real recognize real, relying on Richie Rich
Got dutch master for the kush smoker
Hold the Reggie, for the Bush totters
“Fuck blacks” is what Bush told us
Fuck that we took over
I bust back like a foot soldier
Give you good gas like a shook soda
Bulldozer, he cook cola, no haircut
Gave you the part, that’s not what I do it for
Margie not cool with her
Lisa mad I’m on Simpson, and Homer say, he through with her
Molly make your heartbeat fast
I bought me a house across from Mia's house
And Maggie in the backseat laughing, calling me Daddy
I ain’t your pappy, I’m pimpin’ out of 3 cars
Speaking of Simpsons, I ain’t even mention 3 bars
No rehearsing with that verse
I don’t know why, my partner trippin’ I’m still the same
