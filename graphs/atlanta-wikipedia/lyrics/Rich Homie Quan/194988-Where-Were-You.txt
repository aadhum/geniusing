So I only know a handful
Hey where were you when
I was down bad
Where were you when
I was at my last
Where were you when
I ain't had no where to go
Where were you when
I was locked up no letters wrote
And I don't know what I'm saying
And no baby I ain't playing
Understand I'm a man
Nowhere to be found
So when I make it up to the top
The only thing down is the ground
Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
Where were you
Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah,Yeah
Where were you
[Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Where were you when I was down
Where were you when I was broke
You were nowhere to be found
When I needed you the most
Shooting I'm Spalding
Big weight I move that
Where were you
When I was on my last dollar
I couldn't even
Get no holler
