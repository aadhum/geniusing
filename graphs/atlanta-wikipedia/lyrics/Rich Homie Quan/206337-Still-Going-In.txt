I said they heard that I'm a boss, I gotta motherfucking prove it
Freezer full a niggas, she like "Quan, you the coolest"
Bitch, you watching me like a motherfucking movie
I got four hoes a piece in the pool and my jacuzzi
toothless
Cuz I'm spittin' like a motherfucking infant, ruthless
And I'm back off in the kitchen, you don't know about it
The pack have 'em itching, just like poison ivy
I got GPS bullets that will go and find him
Name a nigga better than me, I'm a go and sign him
In trap like a spider, my name should be Peter Parker
Blowing that Mary Jane while popping them Green Goblins
Geometric numbers call me the math mathematician
I'm a add it, then subtract it, move the pack in the fastest
