Aye, I made an oath to my homies man
I told 'em they ain't gotta hurt no more
And I told 'em that's my word man
Rich Homie baby, yeah!
Give them folks my alias and not my whole name
Take off on that purple, call it Soul Plane
I get my blow from Bone and Ricky cause they dope the same
If you get locked up unpredicted then that ho to blame
Should of never let that bitch knew you was on the way
You can bluff 'em off that sack if you keep your pokerface
Hold the trumph don't throw ya spades
Left my Xbox in the water so I can soak the game
Bitch, I pay my own self
I'm employed, my rich homies ain't gotta work no more
Every chance I'm with 'em I tell my niggas that
We ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah
I tell 'em we ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah
We ain't gon' hurt no More
I tell 'em We Ain't gon' hurt no more, yeah
If You Was Thinking I Was Gone, I'm Back Baby
Hate Picking Up The Phone, Send A Fax Baby
I'm Riding In A Ghost Call It Pat Swazy
