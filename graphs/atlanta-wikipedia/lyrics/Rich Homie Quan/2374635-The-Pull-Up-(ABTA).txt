I ain't jump on no speedboat, I wish I would, and I would have been James Bond
I ain't jump on no speedboat, I wish I would, and I would have been James Bond
Walk through the club did the Rich Homie dance moonwalk, that's the new Billie Jean
And just like Mich, I do it for my family
I ain't jump on no speedboat, I wish I would, and I would have been James Bond
