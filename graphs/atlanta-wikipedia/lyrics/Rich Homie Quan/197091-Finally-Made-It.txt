We finally made it
Told my momma we ain't gotta stress no more
No more unemployed checks no more
I swear I'mma get her that big house with that flexing gate
No more Section 8
We finally made it
We finally made it
I know Teezy would of been proud of me
That's why he still living inside of me
Cause we ain't basic
In my pocket there's a phonebook, alotta pages
Got your address so don't play me
I'll have your momma tied up even your baby
Feeling on her booty
Momma always told me remember faces
Cause I'm vicious, and I'm like a snake
I wrap around them, then I spit venom
And I stay down with my hustle
You don't know my struggle
Told my momma she could dye all her gray hair
Cause they ain't comin' back
Now I'm on top
And these niggas want to hate
And I pat myself on my back nigga...
