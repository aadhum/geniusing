I know I got a lot of hoes, you know what I'm sayin'
That's nothing new to me , they ain't right tho'
Bitch blame my daddy, ho. You're my favorite
You my favorite shawty, fell in love with you
Our conversation's like her pussy, I fuck with it
Wanna hold your hand, gonna walk you down that isle
Ain't no racin', we pacin', wanna give you my child, baby
Your hand, I take it, happy, I make you
Your friends always hatin'
But tell 'em they could never break us
Don't want nobody, I ain't standin' nobody but you
You know I love you, can't trust nobody, won't love nobody but
You got the key to my heart
I'm the same me from the start
And that's who? Rich Homie, baby
