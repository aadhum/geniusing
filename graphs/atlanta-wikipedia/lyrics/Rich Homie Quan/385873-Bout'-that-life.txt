You might talk that life, but you ain't really bout it
You should've seen that price on that A-A-Audi
Imma life my live my life so stay the fuck up out it
I ain't into interviews, I ain't with the talkin'
Mama said "Stay on the pourch" if you ain't bout that life
Why the hell you still calling plug
Like you bout that life
I bought a mirror just to face the truth
You ain't bout that life
Therefore find yourself something safe to do
I'm bout that life (Okay)
Kill a nigga all day
I might tie him up
Beat him with that ball bat
Struggle nigga 9-1-1 Cause you in trouble nigga
You wanna go to war
Grab the rope we could tuggle nigga
bubble
Smoking Keisha till the trouble comes
I be running with some killers
Down with some niggas you've never heard of
I got a bag and a van
In the move we don't need a middle man
She threw a subtweet,You know I caught it
I take my headshots broad day
I'm my hood you hear gun shots all day
[?]
I ain't squshing shit so don't call me
issuse like a magazine
A hundred rounds gonna jump out this magazine
And we will turn your block to a murder scene
Now I forgot I'm a member of a murder team
I'll take your bitch
And let my little homies fuck her
[?]
[?]
nudda
I'm bout that life
I-I get on the beat and I start Diddy Boping
[?]
The 40 came with feet, that mean the heat are walking
Choppa like off spray
Hatters they gonna keep'em off me
