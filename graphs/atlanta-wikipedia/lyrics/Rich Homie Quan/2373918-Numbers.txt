I run up that money again
I'm in buffalo ‘cause I want me some bills
Nigga talking shit, but they don't want it with Quan
Got 99 bands, so what?
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
If you talking 'bout them M's, boy I need a dozen
I ain't know we were related, but I hit my cousin
I ain't tryin' to do no datin', so I skipped the subject
Shorty say that she gon' tell her big brother
I told that lil bitch, "Go and tell your big brother"
Leave him stanking with a smell, but I won't get in trouble
Already five M's, tryin' to get another
My boy got three times ten for a fucking murder
I spent like nine or like ten on my last purchase
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
Hundred thousand dollars in ones, I throw 'em
Fifty thousand dollars in fives, I blow 'em
Two hundred thousand dollars in tens, I do it
A million dollars in hundreds, I swear I ran through 'em
Say my prayers every night ‘cause I know that I sin
Gotta keep that shit 100 like my nigga Ben
