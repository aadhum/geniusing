You can sit back with your feet laid up
In the penthouse suite, you ain't gotta worry 'bout shit
I'mma go out, get the dough, after that, get some more
To make sure that you ain't worried 'bout shit
Baby, where the money at? added? where the dough?
Make sure you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit
Put that on my momma and I put that on my daddy
Swear to God, baby, you ain't ever gotta worry 'bout shit
I ain't worried 'bout shit cuz a nigga like me ain't got too much to lose
been in overtime to shoot
I be still catchin' Charlie, cuz I'm still crazy
Told that bitch to cum thought I was talking masturbation,
won
Niggas talkin' to the police investigatin', ho know what I'm doin'
Since I went solo, these niggas In their feelings, ya feel me?
All I'm tryna get is money, tryna stack a couple dollar all to feed my family
Got some B.E.T awards now it's time for a Grammy
I still do it for my mamma, shouts out to Tammy
