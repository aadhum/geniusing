Heard she got a thing for them niggas with that money
Heard she running game so you better see it coming
And I heard she changed her name
got in some trouble
Now she running from her problem
Like a running-back, you know I'm coming for that money
Now let's party, we gonna get it started
Too much money in my wallet, I can't even count it
Told her ride me like a Harley, fuck it, a Ducati, Kawasaki
She been watching since she heard my song drop
All my niggas hard from the block masked up, robbing
Tell them folks cause I'm teasing we could make news
For them niggas who wanna be me, one of me and one of you
Let that ho stay for the weekend, do whatever she wanna do
Now her friend wanna sleep in and that's cool long as we got room
no proof
They heard I got juice, how can I lose?
Can't run from no nigga, world say she a gold digger
Let's have a party
(I got bitches, I got liquor)
Let's have a party
(I got weed, I got swishers)
(Molly for the bitches)
She be wilding at my parties, she invited
At first she quiet, turn down for what she still excited
I'm gonna hit you with this wood, baby, you gonna call me tiger
Now the party crazy, I got pills, you want X
You know my neighbors hating, party look like project X
And I told that ho to take off, she talking about a check
No disrespect but that bitch in this shit for the check
