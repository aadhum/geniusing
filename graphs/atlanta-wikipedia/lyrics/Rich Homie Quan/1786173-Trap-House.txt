Pistol on me, they say I shot him
Blood on the floor, shout out to the red bottoms
Gotta keep hammer that for my armor
You niggas wanna be Rich Homies, but do not have enough money
Trap house have 'em stupid prices
I don't know what you want, I'mma let you decide it
Nigga they can come on they own, they ain't gotta be invited
Cuz they the main a reason why a nigga on
They treat me different that's
Even though I made it, still walk around with that--
