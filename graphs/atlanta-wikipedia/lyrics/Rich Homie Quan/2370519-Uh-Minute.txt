Nah, which is more than a second
Its been a lil minute since I went back to my old self
It's been a lil minute I was busy gettin' my dough up
Say it's been a lil minute since I flexed up on you niggas
Cause I only need one, only gone shoot one
It's been a lil minute cause I gotta lil boys so fast they growin'
Double R I love you, Devin Lamar I love you
It's been a lil minute but don't never think daddy don't love you
Hourglass full of sand x10 nigga
