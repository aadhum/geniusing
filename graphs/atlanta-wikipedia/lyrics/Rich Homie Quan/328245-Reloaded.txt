This for the people that said I wouldn't be shit
Look at me now mother fucker i'm rich
Gucci ear mug can't tell me shit
Gucci leather gloves i'm feeling myself
Gucci penny leather shoes every time I step
Gucci on my right foot and on the left
I'm gone keep gucci like the Plaza at Phipps
Spent 95 hundred on a lil Gucci watch
Lost a couple partners but I never lost hope
Instead I'm on the microphone fucking with my Nike's on
Riding with a check heard I go in every song
And I ain't done yet Cus i'm still going in
Everybody say i'm next my time is now
Got a whole lot of gator got a whole lot of ostrich
I'm gone hit her from the back Damon Wayan Major Payne
Might bang bang bang just like pop
Haters on the side line praying for me to fall
Intercept it like primetime i'm gone take the ball
Rich Homie coming up these niggas looking sour
We can take it there or flex up a spread
Riding with a check heard I go in every song
And if you ever get lonely you can call Rich Homie Baby
