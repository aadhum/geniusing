I don't fuck with 12
Cause I heard they be listening to a nigga conversation
I won’t tell nobody! (I won’t tell nobody!)
I'm the real Tony Montana
I got fifty naked bitches on a banana boat
Your jewelry sunny, Young Thugger need loc's
He got them birds in the fender bender
Call me with the deal like a fucking pickle, yeah
I just went platinum like a fucking nickel
I hate that we the next superstar boy
If you don’t know why tell them, Quan!
I don't fuck with 12
Cause I heard they be listening to a nigga conversation
Get the fuck out my face unless you owe me some money!
Get the fuck out my face, fuck nigga where the hell
You was at when a nigga had nothing!
Fuck around, slap the shit out of all these niggas!
Trap house bunkin' got all these pistols
My nigga Thug wrist broke doing all that whipping
And I got a .44, I ain't gotta call no killer (Naw, nigga!)
More money, more problems
, I can solve that issue
If it’s off my hip I’mma pull that motherfucker back just like a sling shot
And you ain't hold your homie down like you suppose to
Cause you ain’t never even heard of a green dot
I see folks trying to take pictures so I'm like
Hold up, wait, freeze boy!
I don't fuck with 12
Cause I heard they be listening to a nigga conversation
I don't fuck with 12
Cause I heard they be listening to a nigga conversation
(motherfuck police)
