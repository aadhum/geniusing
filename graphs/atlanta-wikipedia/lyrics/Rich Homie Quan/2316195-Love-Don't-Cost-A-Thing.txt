I say before I go to sleep I pray the Lord my soul to take
If I were to die off in my sleep I pray I see them heaven's Gates
Everyday I drop down to my knees
Don't know what tomorrow bring
I'm gone spend no money on these bits
Cause love don't cost a thing
Love don't cost a thing, love don't cost a thing
No Nick Canon baby, I swear love don't cost a thing
No Christiana Milian, love don't cost a thing
Bitch why you playing childish games, I ain't Dr. Seuss
Tryna kill me, Tom Cruise, Mission Impossible
Tryna take it between her legs like Vince Carter nigga
living days
wonder why (?)
plumber
I'mma (?)
