I can't help cuz I'm getting money and my dream has just begun
Ok now I'm finally famous told my mama no more stressing
My closet on thanks giving kill em' with the dressing
I know his Ray Bans Fake because they ain't how mine came (Them ain't real nigga!)
My death date coming and I ain't scared to go
Bitches calling my name like everywhere I go!
