I'mma keep that nigga up off you
Relieve that stress up off you
Take that cheap shit off you
Put on this dress I bought you
Keep them problems up off you
Take my debit card to keep dem loose dollars up off you
Get a bodyguard to keep broke niggas up off you
Tryna get some neck up out you
Keep them Joe Janes off you
Put on this Fendi I bought you
You look better natural
All that face stuff off you
Keep the lies away from you
