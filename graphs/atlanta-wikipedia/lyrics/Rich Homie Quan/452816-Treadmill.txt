Money over bitches even though I love ladies
Treadmills I’m runnin’ to it
Treadmills I’m runnin’ to it
Treadmills I’m runnin’ to it
On that treadmill I’m running to that paper
You get tired as hell when you running for that paper
I need a towel homie I’m swimming from it
Treadmill I been running
Treadmill I been running
Treadmill I been running
Treadmill I been running
I been running for that paper
I’m tired of that
