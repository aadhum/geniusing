Verse 1: Rich Homie Quan]
Been through a whole lot of shit I be damn if I go back broke naw no way no way
I moved out the hood bought a house in the suburbs told my niggas I don't owe them niggas nothing
Now them niggas mad that I made it
Every time I come around they start acting shady
But I don't give two fucks about it nigga, cuz they wasn't there when I was broke
They wasn't there when I needed help hey
Where the fuck they was at when my mama needed help, they was no where to be found
Beat a nigga ass give a fuck bout lock down
Take a nigga weed and he bet not make a sound
But if he do next thing you know we gon hang his ass out
Jumped out that top roll like Scotty too hotty, Made it to the top now the fuck nigga watching
Naw nigga imma ball nigga just like Spalding
You do a lot of talking, I don't like to talk cause I rather let the chopper talk for me (whoo)
New bitch new car I'm swerving, make her ride it like Kentucky Durby
Promise I won't cheat just do not hurt me
Hurt me no hurt me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna lie no more, I don't wanna cheat no more
I wanna make my wrongs right and I just wanna even the score, score whoo whoo whoo!
Okay with that being said I aim it at his chest
He got his hands up like he saying the pledge
Laughing at my teachers who said I would never be shit
Naw no polish on them nigga, I don't do that gay shit no I don't do that gay shit
Young sissy lovers
I don't fuck with them fuck y'all mothafuckas it's 9 duece no other
Tell me what it is that I could learn from you
Fuck you you stupid muhfucka you suffer
