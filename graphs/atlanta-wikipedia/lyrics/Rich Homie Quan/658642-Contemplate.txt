Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
I will nickel and then dime it, every corner played
I'm a dog, you the bone that I'm gon' get
Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
I might pull up with my nigga, I'm ready to pull the trigger
My pockets swole that's why I feel like JT The Bigga Figga
I'm bleedin' like the original pack of skittles
10,000 dollars worth of rings on my toes, no mistle
But if you pullin' up on Bleveland for no fucking reason
Shoot the .40 or the FN, I'm still contemplating
Shoot that .40 or that FN, I'm still contemplating
