Might have like ten on me (TEN), That ain't really shit (Nah)
Sudio what I'm in homie (OKAY), if I ain't in your bitch
And you ain't blowing if you ain't put in on it (Uh-Uh), Cause I ain't into giving
Fast lane how I'm living (Err),
Ass I ain't tryna kiss it (LEHGO)
A ten to get the homie back (Ten)
And I ain't tryna keep it low, Get high as I can go (LEHGO, LEHGO)
And now I'm hiding in her throat,
Need ten
Don't try me with no 9 for a show, I be laughing at them prices (Hahaha)
