I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
So much money it don't make sense no more
I got my momma a new house,
Told my brother he can have any car off the lot
Make you dance motherfucker, I swear that's what them bullets did
No sleep, no zan.
molly
And if you steal from me I'll kill you baby
I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
So much money it don't make sense no more
I-I made choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
I had to make choices in the past
To get me where I'm at
So much money it don't make sense no more
