you regular type of nigga
Be tryna get in my business, but couldn't run in my business
Cold-hearted motherfucker never love nobody, never love nobody
Still stop at Gresham Citgo just to get me some sweets
I keep my pistol on ready, â€˜cause I don't live for the moment
Shorty claiming she want me, but I pass to the homies
She suck around on my meat, like a piece of bologna
She asking, "Quan, do you got me?"
I tell her, "Get some insurance"
Okay now dish my detergent, I wipe my hands when they dirty
Because all day, all day, I've been running through this money
These bitches be flirtin', I fucked that hoe for no purpose
I swear that all day, all day, I've been running through these condoms
maybe you know
They underestimated me, it hurt they heart, when I broke
Came back in the motherfuckin' trenches
Tight shirt on with some Balmain britches
Them lame niggas over there boy I hit all they bitches
I hit all they bitches, to the point, that I fucked them, and don't call them bitches
I ain't saying what I'm doing may be right
But when I do it, boy, I give the lil kids
I see all my cars in the lot, be careful they watchin'
Nah, be careful they got it, nah, be careful I got jailed
The code word, we call it, "Christmas" when we talking bail
I made a oath and told myself I wouldn't go back to jail
Walked up in the courthouse with a Gucci sweater on, a nigga got hot as Hell
But I ain't give a damn, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
And I don't give a damn if my partner get locked up, accept all the calls
Where I'm from, we ain't seeing shit, we ain't heard of shit, and we don't talk
And every nigga take a loss, that's how you come back, that make you a boss
Her natural hair long, what I like about her
This ain't even all of my shit, this ain't even all of my whips
These ain't even all of my bitches, y'all ain't even all of my niggas
