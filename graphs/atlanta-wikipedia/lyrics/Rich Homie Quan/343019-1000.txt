I done made a million dollars, and I ain't even go to college
They think I'm sponsored by Olympic
No thank you, this an Audi
Mister hundred times ten, nigga keep it one thousand
Keep that shit one thousand
In the booty club we wildin'
I walked out of DeKalb County, they tried to keep me in the system
Everything I'm on I'm killin'
And for the people who said I wouldn't be shit
Guess what nigga?
I've got to keep it one thousand
Just like my Guiseppes
And that black face on that rolex looks like Akon to me nigga
My high school teacher did not show me shit
No she didn't
So, when I got my first check, you know I told her this
