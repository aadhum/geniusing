I'm in L.A. at a Laker game on court side- midfield, nigga
Makin' music for the real nigga
Ask Donald Trump, I want his figures
Rich Homie. No bitch in him
I've been diagnosed straight spittin' venom
You need bifocals just to see in it
If he snitchin'
You'll never see me wit' him
Cause I trick him
Like a motherfucking flea flicker
But I'm frying these niggas- no skillet
And I'm killing these niggas- no bullet
But my wrist all frozen [?] like a bald head
In the winter time with no skully
I'm handicapped
I need crutches
I'm leaning
Grab a box of them Dutches
Cause we gon' need them
When I'm on that syrup, they can't understand a thing I say
I smoke a blunt everyday to take the pain away
That nobody ain't give me shit, I had to make a way
For my niggas and my crew
And this shit I went through
I refuse to go through
Hey, to get where I'm at, it took sacrifices
And it ain't worth having if you don't sacrifice it
I'm at the top, they at the bottom where beginners lay
I think I'm going crazy
Like a mental patient
Give that ho a oscar
Cause she stay acting crazy
And I'm feeling myself (ha!)
Like a straitjacket, baby
All these bitches on me
I don't know which one to fuck
