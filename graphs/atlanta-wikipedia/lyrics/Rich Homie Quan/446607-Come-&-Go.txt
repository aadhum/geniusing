Feel me, Real nigga don't talk man he just do it
Know what i mean and that show for it self
A real killer he gone kill you and won't tell a soul
Pulled up in that phantom thought they saw a ghost
Boy you in yo feelings, I'll tell you so
Took off on these niggas get a telescope
Boy I got some issues I can't tell a soul
My postal man official who I mail it too
Don't lose sleep bout these bitches, cause they come and go
Real nigga over here baby, real figures over here baby
Counterfeit homies we don't deal with it over here baby
It's still Polo, Hilfiger over here baby
3 or 4 hoes is what I
Usually got over here baby
I'm a probably watch you go crazy, my partna caught you 2 days
After I got through with you, your like a bad habit
I need some'n new to do,!
Get your money 1st, Family 2nd
I put my homies 3rd and pray for these blessing
Love purple herb, burn up on them niggas
