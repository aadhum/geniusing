I done finally got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my weight up
Got my motherfucking weight up
See I remember at first
Everybody was sleepin' on me
I tried to wake them up
But they still went temperpedic on me
How the fuck can I go to Hell
With all these baby Jesus on me?
Reefer on me, visa on me, .40 on me
Mo'niffa on me, bitches on me
Niggas lonely, cause I got they ho down
All white bucket seats
Same color cocaine homie
Damon Wayans, shame on 'em
Lot of niggas ass up like a shape up
Fuck a 9-5 them niggas don't pay enough
The money you know we gonna get it
[Verse 3: Offset]
Get your weight up cause you dont weight enough
In my G-o it ain't no trailer riding round in spaceships
Im the truth ain't no lie around me all my niggas keep a hundred round clip from around me
Young rich nigga riding round in a Bentley
Hurt a nigga feelings cause im on a hill in Beverly
Drop house look like a bakery
I see u fuck niggas hating know its jealousy
The audi, the Masi; exotic, Bugatti, Ferrari, you niggas is sorry
My niggas they ballin; Amare
