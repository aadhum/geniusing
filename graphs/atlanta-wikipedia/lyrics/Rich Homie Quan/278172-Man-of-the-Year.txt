See, I walked in with two cups
Feeling like the man of the year
And a broke nigga can’t understand hundred grand
In these pants over here
Picture that I’mma hit her from the back
With my hands on her hip
And I'm smokin' out the bag but I see your man with a zip
Everybody attention on me, cuz everything I say so real
And that little thirty piece spent on the AP, got a nigga so chill!
And I got a 100,000 times 5 thats 500, I ain't got a deal
And all I drink is lean I ain't being funny when I say I dont drink beer
I told my niggas the only rule we got is thou shall never steal
If they don't like, me, nigga, I don't really give a fuck how you feel
I done made a million dollars and I didn’t sell my soul
Tell them folks that I got it
And I didn’t even go to college,
I can touch one button make the top go back like (Aye!)
I can say two words, make her panties just drop like (Hey!)
She all on my dick, now it’s all on her face
Say it's time to eat so I'm saying my grace
More money, more problems I was playing that Ma$e
You broke, I'll say it to your face!
I done walked in with two cups
Feeling like the man of the year
With all this weed I prefer that my blunts are swishers
Ballin too hard on these niggas
Referee blow the whistle
I know you kissed her, right after I dismissed her
You know I had to keep it in the family
Now I'm fuckin her sister
(Oh shit!)
He knows she got smashed by the homie
And I don't need no need no deposit
Cause you know a nigga walking with it on me
It’s been four days, I’mma fuck you like I miss you!
I’ve been locked up twice already fucked up my name in the system
Nigga, I’m still in the hood
I’m still in the trap, I’m still the same nigga!
My momma still live by Greenbriar
Ain’t nothing changed but the figures
Security ain’t check my bag, nigga!
