Young nigga might rob you for that pack
Young nigga might rob you for that pack
You need a life jacket
Might take a L on that sack, and get it right back
I Get Back (8x)
Gotta whole lotta work on me
Ain't tryna catch no cell case
Had to flush my real down the toilet when 12 came
I get it back, like i never lost her
I surround myself around sum bosses
Yellow diamond got me feeling cautions
And I'm dead fresh without a coffin
With all this lean I drink, It feelin like im sleep walkin
Dinosaur
Jurassic Park baby
Had to flush my real down the tolient when 12 came
I Get Back (8x)
I squeeze her just like a Capri Sun
I memory throwin that pack off on the freeway
And I swear I got it back just like a replay
All my niggas they dropped out
Got work, no clock out
That mink on me, that fox out
