I lost a couple partners
When I thought shit couldn’t go wrong (but it did)
Can I get a witness
Cause everybody got problem
And you don’t know where to go
Alot of these bitches weak minded
But you gotta learn how to be strong
And when it feels like you lost everything
Ay gotta hold on, you
You gotta you gotta hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on
Started losing my mind, who am i to trust
Started abusing the grind and now a nigga up
Telling bitches I know it ain’t mine I ain’t even fuck
But i admit i got suck.. real good
And I’m good, I don’t want it
She belong to the homie

I’m popping percocets to keep cautious
Too many percs I mean nauseous, ain't’ tryin to see a hearse or no coffin
Problem, I got a problem, and i call that bit my chopper
Drinking a forty at the grave yard
Got a grip on life when I got out of jail, Got right
I’d break in that house wouldn’t touch ‘em or scare them no way (?)
God make no mistake if I had a chance wouldn't do it twice
As with myself I keep going hard
I walk in by myself just one of y'all niggas try me (do something)
I pulled up like a hearse with a hundred cars behind me
Siamese twin what I call matchin’ Forties
We in Florida so many options
Nigga bite me, now they teeth hurt
I'm tired of all these rest in peace shirts
