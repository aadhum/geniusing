Jumped out the porch
I ain't have nothing
When i was poor
They was laughin at me
Now im on them billboards
And im laughing at em
asamalekoum
Ain't counting my days, feel like ive been on the road for 350
Used to hit a lick just to make a couple bands nigga
I ain't tryna talk to you, if you ain't talking cash nigga
Michael Jackson bad nigga, bad nigga
Creep in your house like Clause, I ain't using no chimney
At the end of every rainbow is there a pot of gold?
