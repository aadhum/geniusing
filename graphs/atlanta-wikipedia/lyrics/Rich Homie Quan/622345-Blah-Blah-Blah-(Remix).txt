[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
It was hard to hear at first
I couldn’t understand what you sayin’
And these bitches bound to get hurt
‘Cause a lot of these niggas be playin’
And I fuck with shorty on the low
And I know she know I’m the man
So that extra shit gotta go
She probably don’t know that I fucked her friend
If she ask about it
I’m a be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
When she try to argue with me
I be like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Trying to get back with me
I be like, “Hell nah nah nah”
And we ain’t talking about no money
I’m like, “Blah blah blah blah”
Heard he got hit in his eye
Heard he got bust in his mouth, see I'm sayin'?
Shorty gon' get on that D
First she gon' get on her knees, she ain't prayin'
I ain't got no fuckin' time, 'less it's fuckin' time
You ain't with it, go, please don't waste my fuckin' time
Got places to go, got people to see
Niggas dissin' for a listen, waitin' for a mention
Niggas lose all respect tryna gain attention
Got that Sprite in my cup
With some of that you ain't even know it
Diamonds dance like K.O.D
Them niggas know I'm from the 313
