I'm playing dead, but I'm dead on you
You not a Blood, but you got red on you
I just got me some pints on a plane I feel like I'm alien
Man, I'm so high up, I'm higher than every alien
Went from open mic to performing in the stadiums
Now all my shoes, they sponsored by Margiella Maison them
I got your baby shaking like his dick inside of there
At 16 I caught me a felon
Influenced by the movie 'Belly'
Cause I swear to God, I blow one of y'all niggas and won't think about it
If that is your main ho, don't bring her 'round me
