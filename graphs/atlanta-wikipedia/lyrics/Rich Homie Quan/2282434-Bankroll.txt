Yeah I got skinny jeans on, nigga
But I know you see these mothafuckin' hanchos pokin' out
[Hook]
Cause I got a bankroll on me
So fat, why I can't even walk straight no more
The bankroll had me so fucked up, I can't even go to school
I can't even think no more
Back of the school sellin' dope
Til I got caught in, told me I couldn't be late no more
I like it how it is, I like who I am
I don't wanna trade nothin' back or trade nothin' in
Yeah Rich Homie baby
If that's your gun and your weed
I'm on probation, my nigga, I don't know shit
I got 4 bitches cookin' in the kitchen
And you best believe all of them bitches naked
One more time
I got 4 bitches in the kitchen cookin'
Best believe all them bitches are naked
I got 4 bitches in the kitchen cookin' and they naked
I don't trust 'em, they might try to take my cut
Dog I be in that trash can, call me Cookie Monster
Cause I got a bankroll on me
So fat, why I can't even walk straight no more
