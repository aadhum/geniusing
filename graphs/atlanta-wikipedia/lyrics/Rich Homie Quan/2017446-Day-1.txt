Ain't nothin' change but the address nigga
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
I've been eating money like a tapeworm
365 that's a whole year
465 days, locked up for more than a whole year
I'm guaped up and got no deal
Can't forget about a .40 cal tucked in my stomach
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
Never thought I'd get a million 'til I made one
Cause I done did a whole lotta fucked up shit, even been locked up like Akon
And I swear how the world hooded every day since we lost Trayvon
Fuck Zimmerman cause...
Chances ain't shit if you don't take one
Mansion full of bitches, bout to rape one
