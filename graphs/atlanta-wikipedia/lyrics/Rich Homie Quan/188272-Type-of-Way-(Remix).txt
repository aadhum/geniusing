Ain’t no telling what he’ll do for the paper
Sade, I’m a smooth operator
That car I’m driving make you feel some type of way
That Custom Breitling make you feel some type of way
Ok now let’s be real I know you feel some type of way
When I get to biting on her ear she make that Tyson face
I give yo girl a dose of this and now the bitch won’t leave me alone
I 15 second Instragram'd
We done smoke that loud
Our shit screamin like Justin Bieber fans
Yall couldn’t get high if CP3 threw you the alley-oop
I crossover you fake hoes
Fat as hell, I’m in cake mode
Too overweight, lift up my shirt and look at all of these bankrolls
Red pill, blue pill, bitch I’m all in the Matrix
In a way you’ll catch me drinkin' on the Lear
Mr. CEO
