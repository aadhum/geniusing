I'm so content with the person I am
I can give a fuck about what you think about me, honestly, bro
I got two bitches on call, no three-way
No disrespect to Mannie Fresh but go DJ
Niggas a wannabe, niggas a drama queen
Everybody know it, since I cut my hair I feel like everybody Quan, haha
I got two bitches on call, no three-way
No disrespect to Mannie Fresh but go DJ
Skinny jeans with a lump, some bankrolls, lil' nigga
They feelin' some type of way, when I walked in like the man
I'm for real, these niggas are underestimatin' greatness
You not Mad Max from choppers, you a Maxine
Naw naw, you a crack fiend, mom dukes my black queen
I got two bitches on call, no three-way
No disrespect to Mannie Fresh but go DJ
