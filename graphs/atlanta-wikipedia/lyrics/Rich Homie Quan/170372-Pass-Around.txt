Them hundred dollar bill what my arm throwin'
When you in rotation keep them blunts goin'
I say the swoop must be tripping
Why she hitting my line this early
Text messages say she outside
So I closed my blinds and curtains
If she find out another bitch here
I know she going try and hurt me
Red had her first then I caught her
So the ho been passed around
Boomerang dick she'll be back around
And I call her Lil Rondo cause she been passed around
I'm ballied down from head to toe
And if they don't get what I'm saying, so rerun me
I can't stop dropping these hits
Clumsy
She bad as hell, we pass around
Like hot potato, your ho get passed around
When finished with her, we gone pass her down
Call them hoes contagious by the way they getting passed around
Roll the window down and let that chopper pass around
If you ain't from over here we gotta pat you down
I was in Houston for a lil minute
Now I'm back in town
I say my bitch missed me, my mama did too
Make sure you don't kiss that girl
Cause I swear she gotta mouth on her
No Damon Wayans..
But when I left I caused major pain
