Play ball
Yeah, Dodgers .. baby
We ain’t trippin on no Cardinals, no Red Sox, no A's, no tigers
It’s all about that World Series Ring
Don't mean a thing if you ain’t got that ring
LA Dodgers, other say doodgers
I’ve been down since Fernando Valenzuela
[Fans cheering]
Announcer:
High fly ball into right field, SHE IS GONE!!!!
Pitching like Ryu,
[Announcer voice:]
In a year that was so improbable, the impossible has happened!
