Bitches hatin' again that's music to my ears
What's you think my fuel was for all Of these years?
I might just bite a motherfucker like Tyson
And just too fly a motherfucker show your chain
Throw your cash, that's cake and icing
With him its a limit
With me its a spree
He buy cars
I write you poetry
He send flowers
I send Mercedez
heaven is everything that heaven it is
The life I live, fit for a King
Now all I need fine little dime that's sharin my shine
We sit back, watch the haters go by
You might win some, but everybody lost one
I put a check on that like Airforce One's
It's easier to lose her than to find her
So wine her and dine her, and treat her to the finer
Things, lines, from the top designers
Bling, shine, like you tryin'a blind her
Seen a lot of ass, but that one behind her
Let's just say that I'm diggin' that like a miner, ya digg?
