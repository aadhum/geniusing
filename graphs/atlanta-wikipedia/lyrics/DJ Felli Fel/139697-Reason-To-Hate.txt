[Bridge: Ne-Yo]
T-Raw straight from a dice game
Came up roll a Rolls Royce seats light tan
Used to stay in when it rain now I go out and make it rain
No shame, I can pay a years rent with one chain
Bread over bed Stunna said We the business
In the club everybody show me love like I'm Raymond
For the chains whips
[Outro]
