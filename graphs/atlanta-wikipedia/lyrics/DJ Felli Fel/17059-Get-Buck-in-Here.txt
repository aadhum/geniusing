CHEA!
They call me Diddy!
Bet a million and a half cash
make you explode
Combs
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one-night scandal
While you make it clap-clap-clap-clap-clap
My livelihood is not Hollywood
I'm still Southside Atlanta,
that's a lively hood
If you wanna learn somethin', bring your mother!
Sit back and observe, invite your friends
We can mix it all up, like juice and gin
Felli on the celly with a couple of twins
'Cause tonight, damn right we gon' do it again
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one-night scandal
While you make it clap-clap-clap-clap-clap
G4 jet flyin
Too much booty for one man to handle
When all I need is a one-night scandal
While you make it clap-clap-clap-clap-clap
