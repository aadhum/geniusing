Glaw, Glaw, Glaw, fuck nigga got anna
Got your bitch, she white, Hannah Montana in a Panamera
She a college girl, but her wrist Katrina
Hit the club, diamonds shinin' like I'm drinkin' Margarita
I'm in London with the plug, gettin' the same car as the Beatles
Got bricks in the Audi, the Hannah Montana, the molly go crazy
Got Lizzie McGuire, Got Lindsay Lohan and I can't forget about Katy
I keep the white like the 80s,
I keep the white like I'm Shady
Put the white rims on the Mercedes, young nigga feel like Pat Swayze

In the V.I.P. rollin' a cord
passin' out mollies to foreigns
2 bitches one me, Malcolm in the middle
Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashin' paparazzi
I'm twistin' the rock like I'm Rocsi
She sweatin' like she ran a mile, she soakin' wet she need a towel
She suckin' her lip, bitin' down
She moanin' and makin' them sounds
Hannah makin' them go bananas
She fuckin' and suckin' on camera
My jag, still a Panorama
I'm beatin' the pussy like Michael, I call her Dirty Diana
