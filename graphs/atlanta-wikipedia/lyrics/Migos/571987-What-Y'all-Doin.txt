All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?
Feel like Will Smith, I see millions, I'm gonna pursue it
No I had to tell my mom sorry, I could picture me in that 'Rari
Send the Green Dot cause I miss 'em
R.I.P. my nigga Pistol, can't believe the bullet hit him
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?
Ever since a youngin' I was a problem
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?
