I don't need no shooter nigga
One gunman
I just dress in all black with my gun, man
Like John Wick
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
Truck load, ammo
All black, suit and tie
Don't move in camo
One bullet, one headshot
Gotta pay for the dirt that you're doing off top
I pay for mine when I see his head
That's the same way the gladiators did
I'm the gunman but I love the kids
Have a 4th of July on the 6th
I'm John Wick with the black tints
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
When them niggas killed my dog Pistol P
A nigga turned into John Wick
I told them my Mustang was not for sale
But they still tried me like my name was John Wick
These niggas don't know who they fuckin' with
I'm a catch him slipping just like Ricky
Call of Duty shit
When it come to the artillery, I'm very talented
Takeoff Dahmer, I be killing shit
Mini AK with the banana clip
When I travel put it in my travel kit
Rick James, I'm rich bitch
Momma told me I'm a walking lick
Scope on the chopper, I see you chillin'
Hit you and your wife and I leave the children
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
Feel like the president since they killed Pistol
can get you knocked down by a nigga want a nickel
Bullets tickle your stomach like Pillsbury
Reach for the chain and his body glitch
50 Cent AK the magic stick
All black, one gunman
John Wick, that's a bad man
All black, one gunman
John Wick (baow!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
All black, one gunman
John Wick (woo-oop!)
All black, one gunman
John Wick, gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, one gunman
All black, one gunman
John Wick, baow man!
All black, one gunman
John Wick (John Wick)
