It’s a knock at my front door
12 kickin in my front door
Now we running out the back door
Drop the pistol, this the life of that bando
It’s a narc on my front door
It’s a pot on a stove
Up in a bowl, 100 blunts rolled (gas)
I hit the back door
Me and Quavo meet Offset at the store
Skip going crazy in Mazzie
Driving like a nigga caught a body
I’m selling them burgers like Hardee's
Man fuck, my mama hit my phone
12 in my home, they won’t leave me alone
get his cerebellum
What you mean hand you the pistol? Here the Mac-11
Got off the phone with Gucci, he told us we on the news
We all over the channels, 4, 5, 11, and 2
He said, "Be safe lil' bruh, just hit me when you need some money"
