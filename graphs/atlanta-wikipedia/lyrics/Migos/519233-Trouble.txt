Pull up and I got a lot of work all on the freeway
What nigga you know making M&M's on a Tuesday
Migo Gang, Hustle Gang, known to get it hustle everythang
Migo Gang, Hustle Gang, known to get it hustle everythang
Go out and hustle if you want the muscle man with the trouble
How many times I pull up with the chopper
Nigga they don't want trouble
Trouble, fuck nigga they don't want trouble
How many times I pull up with the chopper
Fuck nigga they don't want no trouble
Mama told me 'Quavo stop trappin'
I like kicking doors and taking gold I gotta have it
Made a million dollars independent, I seen it
Pockets on Mondo Burger, call me Kenan
Giving me a massage, I think she orthopedic
Who want the problem, you don't want no trouble
We pull up and solve 'em
Shout out my driver, he get a million on the highway
Got the work in exhaustion
Gotta stay cautious, not taking no losses, Migos young bosses
Looking at my diamonds, looking like they frosted

As an adolescent I was up in trouble
Never listen to a nigga, never listened to my mother
BAH CLAH CLAH,

Got the 40, call me Michael Finley, 50 bricks up in the fender
Hit the nigga with the semi
Hit the witness, we don't get a sentence
AK-47 tall as a midget
Migos on top of you niggas like we is the gunner
My niggas keep a Magnum, I ain't talking about a rubber
You don't want to go to war, I ain't talking about a tugs
Niggas be swimming, drowning up in the blood puddle (Pussy!)
Put a nigga up under the ground, call him Harriet Tubman
You say you a shooter but why the hell your bullets rusty

My niggas bust guns like Chicago
And my money stack as tall as the sky go
Anybody fucking with me know what it is
That shit that you be talking about we did it for real
I told my nigga Doe B Imma get him a mill
He died in December and we getting it still
Hopping out Ferrari with a pocket full of money
.40 in my trunk, bust down a couple hundred
Lames that belong on the wall of shame
Well you can check my stats, I'm in the hall of fame
Bitch nigga better miss me with all the games
Before I pull the chopper, decorate the wall with brains
And I ain't fucking round with it
Last 13 years he ain't fucked around, did he?
Even as a young nigga, bossing up around Diddy
Going over to The Cheetah pocket full of Velveeta
Hear the name through the speakers, what it do my nigga?
Hustle Gang is the name, we the bankroll mob
Get big bankroll is what we do my nigga, aye!
