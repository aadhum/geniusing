Chopper with that hundred round that’s a lay ‘em down
All my niggas play with Whitney, that’s that Bobby Brown
I rob in my black tee, hit licks in my black tee
4-5 long as Shaq’s feet
I'm sippin' on that mud,
I'm not a pig, I'm a squid
All my niggas keep that sig like Billy the Kid
No drag queen, but we aiming at your wig
All my niggas keep that saw like that movie Saw
Double pump, pistol grip, that’s that sawed off
We get them choppers shipped in straight from Moscow
These diamonds brighter than the light, I'm a fucking moth
WWE, yeah, you know my team is raw
If the plug front me bricks then I get it off
Fifty choppers in that Maybach like I’m Ross

I’m posted at BP, serving that gas like QT
Me and Thugger Thugger just boolin'
Strapped with choppers and Uzi's
Don’t front me no set, I'm taking off with it, call me Darren McFadden
You know I wear Prada, you niggas wear nada
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit
We don't fuck around with that fuck shit
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust bitch
Fuck with 1017 you'll get bust quick
