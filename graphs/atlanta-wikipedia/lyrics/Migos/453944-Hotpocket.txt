All these goddamn bricks man
There go the feds
Put the bricks in the attic, hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for you fuck niggas plotting
she got chickens in her stocking
All white Charger pull up with the police lights
Red, blue, and white, asking questions, I’ll take flight
Run back to my trap, stash them bricks off in the attic
12 hit my spot, throw saran wrap and plastic
They thought they was gon' catch me slipping
Looking and searching for chickens and pigeons
They ain’t find shit but a fork in the kitchen
Keep an egg beater, yeah I'm always whipping
Stay with a PT, always sipping
Young rich nigga with the all gold kitchen
Put the bricks in the attic, hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for you fuck niggas plotting
she got chickens in her stocking
Put the bricks in the attic, hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for you fuck niggas plotting
she got chickens in her stocking
The bitches they play with the water
They splashing the work and I call em Free Willy
Young nigga with banana clip (ba bow!)
Niggas start peeling
Young nigga and I’m sipping on mapple
I meant maple,
My house got marijuana acres
Put the bricks in the attic, hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for you fuck niggas plotting
she got chickens in her stocking
Put the bricks in the attic, hope the feds ain’t watching
Sniper on the roof for you fuck niggas plotting
she got chickens in her stocking
