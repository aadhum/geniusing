Migo, we in here
I don’t know what language you're speaking
Every time you see us we get larger and larger
I don’t understand the lingo
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Down on your knees, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, Brokanese
Talking Brokanese, I take yo' bitch
and broke her knees
Brokanese, Brokanese
You’re speaking Brokanese like : Can I have a dollar please?
I'm Hercules
you're Brokales
WWE, you boys jabronies
GLAW! GLAW! GLAW!
I come with the chopper feeling like Tony
You niggas is cloning, copy me
Then you look at us, like you ain’t did nothing wrong
You got the nerve to bite the swag, then try to get us on a song
No fuck nigga, we don't rock like that
That's how niggas go broke like that
If you wanna make millions, then join QC independent
"Bon appétit", it’s time to eat
Beat the pot like a nigga boxing bob and weave
I'm whippin' a quarter key
A whole thing
I don’t talk your language ‘cause you're talking Brokanese
You broke down to your knees
Hold up freeze
Whippin' the Anna Nicole and Lindsay
My diamonds looking like KK (white)
Young nigga I got 40 acres
Mansion house so damn big, I don't talk to nobody
I ain't got no neighbors
My neck is cold as a glacier
We're ballin', you're not a player
Front row, courtside at the Lakers
I don't understand you, you speak Brokanese
Never play piano but I whip with lots of keys
Trappin' and cappin' the fishes
Bando smell like Captain D's
Private jet to Belize
smoking OG Christmas trees
You niggas ain't speaking my language
Ain't got a dollar you're so Brokanese
Why you niggas pocket watching
I'm mister Miyagi and that's why you copy me
You niggas so broke it's killing me
In Australia I'm the crocodile hunter
