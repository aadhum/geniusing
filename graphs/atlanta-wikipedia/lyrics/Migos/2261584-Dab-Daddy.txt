Hoes calling me the dab daddy (I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy)
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status (You can check my status, you can check the stats)
My money counter do the adding (Money counter do the rules)
I bought a carpet from Aladdin (I bought a carpet from Aladdin)
So I can finesse and do magic (So I can fly and finesse, nigga)
Rammin' the engine in traffic
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Offset!
From the jail cell,
my wrist so sick it got sickle cells
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel, you say this and that while my pockets filled
We got diamonds and gold, ain't no stainless steel
Independant, we didn't take a deal
Thirty thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab
10 pairs Margielas, you do the math
When I pull up on Beverly shopping, I pull up in a Phantom, not in a cab
Red bottom drippin' it's a blood bath
Ferragamo, arrested for my dab
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Dab! Dab! On top of dab
Takeoff in the kitchen like I'm Dexter's Lab
Young rich nigga but they know that we handsome and wealthy
Takeoff is spillin' Actavis on new Margielas
Everywhere I go they call me dab daddy
Dab daddy, got the different, different dab
Dippin', dabbin' in the Phantom, lookin' at the roof and it's panoramic
Diamonds clear water like they from Atlantic
Dab daddy, I'm the king of the fashion!
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy
I'm the dab daddy, I'm the dab daddy yeah
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
