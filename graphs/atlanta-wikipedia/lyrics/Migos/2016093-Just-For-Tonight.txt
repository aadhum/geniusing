I want you, you want me
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight)
I want you baby (you)
And you want me (me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
One night (one night, one night)
Yo
Look at my charm and baby look at my arm (look at it)
You know you the bomb, I'mma call you Saddam (boom)
Never mind that, hop up in my coupe and let the top back
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight)
I want you baby (you)
And you want me (me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
One night (one night, one night)
Yo
Takeoff ain't no superman, ain't no need to bring that cape out
Givenchy my skin is, Versace my sheets when I lay down
Tried to wet up my Mulsanne but it was bulletproof
With them snipers, no binoculars, we looking for you
Feel like my shadow when I'm walking, she keep stalking me
Feel like she work for AT&T, she keep texting me
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight)
I want you baby (you)
And you want me (me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
One night (one night, one night)
Yo
It's only for one night cause I know that you not really worth it
If I text you tomorrow you gonna be asking for Birkin
Don't be involved in your feelings cause offset leaves bitches hurting
I got to use me a condom cause I don't want no more gerber
I'm in the Maybach with curtains, she suck me up like a sherbert
I want you, you want me
Just for tonight (Only one night)
Just for tonight (Just for tonight)
I want you baby (you)
And you want me (me)
Just for tonight (Only one night)
One night (one night, one night)
Yo
