Falisha, I ain't gotta ask no nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga, don't ask me, nigga
Falisha, I ain't gotta ask that nigga
I ain't askin' no nigga for shit, nigga
Falisha, act like Falisha, act like Falisha
Falisha, you act like Falisha, you act like Falisha
No I'm not askin' you niggas for nothin' because I don't need 'em
When I was down bad, was I really askin' you people?
I was hurtin', I really had to kick them doors and do shit illegal
Then we took off, at the top floor of the continental
criss cross the block like the eyes on Debo (cock-eyed)
Got tired of runnin' to my mama for shit
So I kicked me a door in at 17
All of my brothers depend on me
All of my sisters depend on me
Don't run up on me askin' me for nothin'
'Cause I'm takin' my people across the country
I used to beat up the pot, Adrian Broner
Aligator loafer, crocodile hunter
It's nothin' to go buy a Bentley
Unlike you lil' niggas, pockets on empty
When it come to the guala they callin' me Polomalu (run to the money)
Different color diamonds, Dennis Rodman
Young Migo my people
Couple thousand, that don't mean you a boss
I got another 500 stashed behind the wall
Quavo do too, Offset do too
