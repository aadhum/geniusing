If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
Used to be kickin' them doors in my Jordans, I walk in the club with my Lous (Louboutins)
Dropped out of school, they said we was fools, them diamonds looking like a fool
We gave you, so fuck it, we want it back
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
Call it trap funk 'cuz we having gas bags, and we put the fork in the trap
Dab daddy, pull up, these bitches suck me like Dracula
Christian Louboutins, a walking mannequin,
my balmains full of blue Benjamins
Don't drink that shit just to be cool, I only sip Actavis 'cuz it's my medicine
They put me on the news, they tryna embarass me
Got the Migos looking like we some terrorists
If you don't know what you're hearing, you're listening to that new trap funk
Same keys that you're hearing, same keys that I got in my trunk
Trap funk 'cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
'Cuz I'm having gas bag and I made it off of trap talk
