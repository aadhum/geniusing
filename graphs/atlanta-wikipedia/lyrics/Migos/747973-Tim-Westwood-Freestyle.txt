One man, honcho
Truck load, ammo
All black, suit and tie, don't move in camo
Gloves on, no Evie
Trigger finger forever ready
One man, one machete
Out the jungle, turn you to spaghetti

Niggas talkin' bout we ain't getting money boy that's fiction
Look at all my diamonds, and my diamonds water drippin'
With the boards on the window? Bitch, that's bando
Honestly we still sipping seals, double seals
Sipping Actavis, that mud on me, now bitch, how you feel

Free my nigga Bobby Bitch
Hoes in the lobby, bitch
Ooh, diamonds look like coffee, bitch
