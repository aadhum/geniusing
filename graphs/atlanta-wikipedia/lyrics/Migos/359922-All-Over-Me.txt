Snakes, they all over me
Hoes, They all over me
Versace, they all over me
Snakes, they all over me
Hoes, They all over me
Versace, they all over me
I pull up in that bumblebee
And who am I supposed to be?
It's Quavo from the BMG
Got a 28 of Cali purp, we call it Minnesota Vikings
Snakes, they all over me
Hoes, They all over me
Versace, they all over me
Snakes, they all over me
Hoes, They all over me
Versace, they all over me
Snakes, they all over me
Hoes, They all over me
Versace, they all over me
