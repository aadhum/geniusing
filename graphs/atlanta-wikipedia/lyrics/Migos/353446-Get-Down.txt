Do you want me to put a price tag on your head nigga? (money)
Do you want me to go find out where you laying nigga? (go get em)
Do you want me to hit your block and start spraying nigga?
No, they don’t want me to hit they block and start spraying nigga
I’m making your trap look like dinosaurs
Extinct, Jurassic
Shout out to Drama dramatic
Who the fuck told you that you can sell dope and step right on my block?
Keep fucking with me nigga, they’ll find you in a river somewhere in Chattanooga, Tennessee
Snatch all the clothes out the mall like the looters do
The pistol I got for my enemies
Make em get in line like an assembly
My niggas is lunatics but we not Nelly
You can fuck with that nigga but my dope is cleaner
You can shop with him but my price is cheaper
