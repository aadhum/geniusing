Migo!
Sup Zay' ?
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Muhammad Ali
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Down in Rose West side and Williams (Free Willie Mack!)
You niggas out here really hurting
Locking the block down like Richard Sherman
Give the wine to the bitches , cause I'm pouring up lean
We kicked the Versace went to the Giuseppe store
Grab that shit straight off the mannequin
(Giuseppe me!)
When it comes up to this rap shit
You Sonny Liston and I'm Cassius Clay
Independent just like Macklemore
Hitting these hoes like McIlroy
Sipping on Actavis like it was Moët
What you think you doing with your little bitty Rolex
Maison Margiela my shoes is an alligator
And I'm a G but I'm not a Mason
