They said it was called the trap
But on the north side we call it the bando
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for (Act')
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow (aye)
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors (boom)
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold ('sace)
Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for (bitch)
I got the key unlockin' the game like a cheat code (cheat)
Looking in my DM and I see your main ho (aye)
Slap a nigga with the Ric Flair robe on
We the first ones that came up with the bando (bando)
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for (Act')
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow (aye)

The way they took a nigga’s dab I want to smack a nigga (baow)
Honey-sicles (uigh)
I’ma send your ho a text with the purple pickle (hoe)
I know niggas in the bando still trapping nickles (ungh)
Who the fuck you think you scaring with that lil Nina? (who)
Call my niggas and they pulling up like 'Al-Qeeda' (aye)
Damn I mean Al-Qaeda, spray ‘em like a firefighter
For fucking with the albino, feeling like Mekhi Phifer
Niggas having ghostwriters, stripes like I’m Tony Tiger
I know we got the touch like we work for Midas (Midas)
Light my cookie with the purple in it like the Vikings
