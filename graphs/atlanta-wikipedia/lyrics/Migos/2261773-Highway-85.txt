Migo N.W.A nigga
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Woke up quick at about noon, just thought that I had to be on the north soon
Mama on my line sayin' I'm on Fox 5
I said "you sure Ma?" she said "baby it's live"
I said "Fuck twelve" turn up the alpine
Rockin' down Boggs Road seen a punk ass busta
Police pull me over got the mac in the back
Once upon a time not long ago
3 amigos by the name of Offset Takeoff Quavo
Mirror mirror on the wall, what would you do if police told you pull over your car?
Put the gas out, it's Friday and it's smokey in here
Blue and white lights on the north side
