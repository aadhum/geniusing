I'm takin' all my goons to Cali, then we hit the islands
The streets a concrete jungle, play the game like it's Jumanji
My pockets is sloppy, only buy Rarris and Gottis
Migo gang is my posse, takin' over like the Nazi's
I just got out the county, money old like Bill Cosby
Pull up in Audi pull up in Rarri whip full of net it is a mystery
tell the Lord forgive the sin in me
