Two cups filled up with easter pink
Take a minute, rest in peace, to PIMP C
Take a minute, rest in peace, OG Dee
Two cups filled up with easter pink
Take a minute, R.I.P, OG Dee
Two cups filled up with actavis
Damn! rest in peace, to PIMP C
Louis V all over me I'm living luxury
I remember the last time when double talked to me
Told me y'all the hottest niggas in the street
He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency
So I go buy a pint of lean
I'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!
Damn! now I gotta pour a four
I understand I have committed a sin
Double Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle
