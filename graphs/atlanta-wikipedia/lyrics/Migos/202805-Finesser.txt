Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Finesse the plug, I don’t need a Benjamin
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense
[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
Juug, Finesse, Steal
When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Hoes set you up, they don’t give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Tryna get a profit,
running to that money like Sonic
All my cars robotic
[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
Indian plug in that castle
Bald headed Jag, got cancer
Turn your main bitch to a dirty dancer
I’m cooking and wrapping them chickens
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My wrist so cold, December
That steel wrapped around me like Bender
[Hook: Quavo]
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
