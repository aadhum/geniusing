It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Feel like Juvenile, baby, back that ass on me
I fucked her on a Tuesday, shout out Makonnen
Performin' on stage, no safety on the pistol
My neck lookin' like Mr. T,
my hands is lookin' like James Worthy
Don't make it rain I make it thunder
