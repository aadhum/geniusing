Bitch dab, bitch dab
Bitch dab, bitch dab
Bitch dab, bitch dab
Bitch dab, bitch dab
Bitch dab, bitch dab
Dab, dab, dab, dab, dab, dab
Look at my dab, everybody sayin' dab
Trap niggas on the map, trap niggas like to dab
Trap niggas in the bowl, trap niggas on the stove
birds sangin' just like Mary Mary
The bricks got wings like the tooth fairy
pinky ring yellow canary
Touchdown on the Pack and I run it like Barry
Migo like Ed, Edd and Eddy
Look at my dab, got me feelin' like I'm Fab
I play with the water need swimwear
Look at my dab, dab
Got me dabbin', Yung Rich Nation gear
Michael Jordan I'm perfecting my craft
No money counter, count it up with my hands
Young nigga, I can show you how to do math
Sippin' on drank, I pour up some muddy
My nigga not tryin' to remember my past
Mr. McMahon, I fire you and your staff
Watchin' you niggas dabbin' made me laugh
touchdown like I'm Takeoff McFadden
Call a play like I'm Takeoff John Madden
Enough of that swag I put it in a casket
Stay off my grass, call me Takeoff Stanley
Look at my dab, dab
