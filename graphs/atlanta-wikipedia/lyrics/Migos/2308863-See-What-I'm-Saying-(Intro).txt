[Quavo: Verse 1]
I'm having a problem
They copy the flow and they really think they out rapping me
Momma taught me how to turn a boy into a man
Just me and my brothers started from the bottom
Man
King of the jungle
They calling me Quavo Mufasa
When I came in with Versace they calling me Quavo Big Poppa
