You know it feel good when your recognized
Recognized (Recognized, Recognized)
I just wanted to be
I didn't know all this was gonna come with it
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
Now I'm having recognition (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition (recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be Recognized  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition
I just want to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be Recognized (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition
I'm in the trench coat for the skies
I keep the .45 on my waistline
These Balmains no Calvin Kleins
Flood my neck with that gold like Busta Rhymes
caught
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be Recognized  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition
I'm addicted to drank and I can't even help it (lean, lean, drank, drank)
They finally recognized
They copy the way we rhyme
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
I just wanted to be Recognized
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition  (recognition, recognition)
I just wanted to be Recognized  (recognition, recognition)
Now I'm having recognition
