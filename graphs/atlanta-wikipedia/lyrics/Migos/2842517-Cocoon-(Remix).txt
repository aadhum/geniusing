Brand new Fubu, ooh-ohh
Fat Albert on the side of my shoes, ooh-ohh
Rag top, nigga, fuck around and say
Shot up right up your block, (Shot right up your block)
Every time I pull up the LIV, I'm in a half a million dollar car (Skrt skrt skrt)
Kick rocks,
bars
I'm bleedin' red, man I'm bleedin' bad
I'ma go and fuck your daughter study law
I'ma shed my pride
Yeah, everybody dance now, smile now
Turn to a blood, them A's went down now
Ten bitches ready up at the Boom Boom Room
