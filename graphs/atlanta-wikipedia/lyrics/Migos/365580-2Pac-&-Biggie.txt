Pop a molly have you shaking like that nigga Diddy
I got that Bobby Brown but I ran out of Whitney
Still got some Brittney, got a lot of Lindsey
Black and grey old Cutlass, George Gervin
Drugged up I'm bout to overdose, call me Elvis
Bout to go to the jeweler, call up TV Johnny
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
I know junkies that will kill, for a bump
I know niggas that finesse pigeons out the trunk
Lil' goons on the block like a 9 to 5
I know hoes that sell they soul for bankroll
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
Got a plug thats talking them bricks, dealing with Yao Ming
Got a plug on that gas, and that lean
