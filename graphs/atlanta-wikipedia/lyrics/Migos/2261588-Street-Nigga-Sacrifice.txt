Ran from the task force, my lifestyle like a rodeo horse
XXL magazine, December issue cover Fader
They sayin' Migos better than the Beatles
Paul McCartney, I would like to meet him
Quavo livin' legend, Elvis, that's why I pull up Lincoln Continental, gone!
Pistol in the locker, Gilbert Arenas
Grandma was a sacrifice, can't forget
Choppas eat you niggas like a termite
Bloody money turn to clean money
Want a feature, nigga?, Gotta pay the price
