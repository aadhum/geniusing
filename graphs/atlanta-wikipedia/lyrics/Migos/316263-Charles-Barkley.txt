Number 34
"Fheww!" Sell a brick so fast : Float like a butterfly, sting like Ali
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli
Charles Barkley, 34oz got the broccoli
Yo, Quavo
I got the broccoli
Young nigga, I come to bless the economy
Remember my teachers, they say I wouldn't make it
I wonder if they ever think of me ...
Your bitch she say that she loving a boss I tell her get lost (Adios)
Now we in Bentley's and Rovers in Beverley
No father figure, I'm a street nigga
Call me the god-father fuck nigga
Rich forever, never going broke
I don't give a fuck if I got to go to selling dope
I got the bags, grocery store
Selling them O's, flipping them bowls
(Eat that damn broccoli !)
Remember me I'm at the bus stop flexing my brand new pair of Barkley's
Cook it like poultry
