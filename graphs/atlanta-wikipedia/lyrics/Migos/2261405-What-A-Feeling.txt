Mamacita, bad bitch, and we split em' hit em
Whole lotta money, give it to the children
Whole lotta choppas coolin' with extensions
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
What a feelin', what a feelin'
Kickin' dough was my specialty
Mama told me she gon' get at me
But I was worried 'bout the police
Runnin' from 12 in a Gucci fleece
It's a great feeling that they notice me
Came from bando to mansion to TV screen
No more trappin' no more ReNeNe
Now it's double XL Migo magazine
Don't get me wrong, I keep the magazine
Now I'm the last don, shout out to Master P
Breakin' in the mitten, my nigga was sellin' Whitney
Break niggas neck, walkin' in the chinchilla
VVSing for from my jeweler out in Cuba
I see fugazi diamonds on your Cuban link,
Take that bitch make her work for me
wanna fuck on the shower pole? Mimi
