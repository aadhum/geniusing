Young rich nigga, Migo!
(Honorable C.N.O.T.E.)
I told her to beat it
You would have thought she was Michael! (Go!)
She was 16 when she had a baby, (16!)
Her baby daddy kept on driving her crazy
She wondering how she gon' take care the baby
She working at Folly walking around naked!
I fuck her then kick her right out of the spot,(Get out!)
I don't know what the fuck up with these strippers
They don't have a house and don't have a vehicle!
These bitches ain't shit I forgot to mention, (Huh?)
You cuffing that ho, who you think you tricking?
Sneaking and geeking, I see your eyes, (Geekin'!)
Your daughter be seeing nigga's in and out
So please do not try to run game on me, I'm not a Playstation
Please do not try to run game on me, I'm not a 360
L.A.
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
Told that bitch, "Pour your own muddy trouble"
