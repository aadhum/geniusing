They came around about 5 o' clock this morning (12!)
They telling me I'm copping contraband from informants
"Channel 2, Fox 5, you's America's most wanted!" (Ooh!)
Feds hit the spot say I'm copping from informants
Channel 2, Fox 5, I'm America's most wanted! (Ooh!)
I pick up my shit and then hit the door (Oh shit!

Surrounding my house and they kick the door (Boom! Boom!)
I'm trying to get up and take off, the officer speared me, like Goldberg
Say "Where were you 3 o clock on the dot?" "My Momma's house" "You a goddamn liar"
Have you heard about your new worker? (Nah) Know I put him in your circle
