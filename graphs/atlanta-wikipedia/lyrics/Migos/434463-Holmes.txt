Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Migo he's my Holmes, Jesus he's my Holmes
Hector he's my Holmes, Pedro he's my Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Holmes, Holmes, Holmes
Juan that's my Holmes, Migo that's my Holmes
Hector that's my Holmes, Pedro that's my Holmes
Jugged my money up and bought a house next to Gucci's
Pull up in that grand black Audi Oakland Raider
Gotta watch out for them niggas with the venom like komodo
Gotta velcro seal the gas so that 12 won't smell that odor
Yeah you know I fuck with Shawty Lo
Hector, Freethrow, Carlito them my Migos
