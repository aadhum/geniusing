Walk in the kitchen, I make a fatality (finish him)
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
I bought Versace shades from Ray (Ray Charles!)
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
