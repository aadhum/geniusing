Throwin' money up at Follies
I came back in the game like DRose
QC the label, my nigga, they solid
I got my dick up in her mouth like Colgate
I came to party, I drink lean, no Bacardi
OG gas stank so bad it smell like somebody farted
Wanna party all night, take molly all night, got a white girl screamin' gnarly
No 2Pac, no Snoop Dogg, welcome to the gangster party
No Nick Cannon, but these bitches be wylin'
Before you walk my trap, I'm checkin' for the wires
