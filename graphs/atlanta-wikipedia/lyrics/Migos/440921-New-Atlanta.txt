[Intro: Jermaine Dupri]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I told ya'll niggas long time ago
Come fuck with my city, nah mean?
Rich Homies, Migos, Young Thug, and me motherfucker
Welcome to new Atlanta,
Phantoms on top of Phantoms
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras, I'll hit em for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
Crossover spaghetti junction
Lil' momma she foreign, she not from this country
Young nigga, you stay with your mama, call you Bartholomew
Do you remember my teachers said we wouldn't make it
I gotta thank y'all, Atlanta made us famous
Across the world, we in Venezuela
The new Atlanta like the old Lakers
I'm a young rich nigga, whippin' up chemicals
Middle of the summer wearin' chinchillas
You niggas be cloning, they watching like Sony (you copy me)
Came out the pussy with a spatula
Selling dope like Pablo Escobar
Bentley Mulsanne I just blew out the brain
Of the Audi R8 with the paper temp plate
Takeoff and Thug, Offset, Quavo, Quan
New Atlanta, we the heavyweight
Welcome to new Atlanta,
Phantoms on top of Phantoms
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras, I'll hit em for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
Givenchy attire
I'm trappin', they think that I live in The Wire
I had to flood out my new Audemars
Drop in the Ghost, scaring niggas like Michael Myers
All the lil' kids lookin' at me admiring
I pull up in 'Raris, I Forgi my tires
I'm dropping a four in my Tropicana
This the New Atlanta, pullin' up in Phantoms
For you niggas that monkey, we got bananas
Put a price on your head like a bandana
Dipset, like Juelz Santana
I'm dropping the top on my panoramic
Welcome to new Atlanta,
Phantoms on top of Phantoms
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras, I'll hit em for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
Motherfuckers hatin' and shit
Motherfuckers still moving out here and shit
It's still love in this motherfucker
And niggas think this shit gon' stop
It ain't never gon' stop, it's just gon' keep going
[Verse 4: Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug]
A-T-L-A-N-T-A, GA that where I'm from
East Atlanta, that where I stay, aka the slums (east Atlanta)
I got, I got trained to slime without a gun
Migos and Quan roll up another one
Doctors don't know what we on
New Atlanta, we stuntin', I keep me like 20 bands
Shawty Lo lifestyle, Iâ€™m the man
I ain't Future but I'm having free bands, I can't help who I am
Welcome to Atlanta, where you better watch your tongue
Hey, I did dirt for this water, I feel like a pond
I'm from Bleveland,
Welcome to new Atlanta,
Phantoms on top of Phantoms
New Atlanta, we don't need security, walking around with that hammer
Porno movie, fuck your camera baby)
(Don't get your bitch ass killed in new Atlanta baby)
(We don't fuck with cameras, I'll hit em for real)
(Fuck the police we won't tell, we keeping it trill)
