I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep
Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
Falling in love with the Benji's
I sip on the Actavis, it keep me grounded
Making county calls
Remember the time when my teacher said I wouldn't make it?
I'm hungry, I know that the M & M's coming, I taste it
I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep
Don't fall in love with the fishes
Do not get drowned in the water
I can't fall in love with the fishes
Young nigga I think I did it
Falling in love with the Benji's
Too many little bitty bitches
Me and Quan
I hit lil' mama wit the switcheroo
Aww man
They wanna boot up on that Molly, San-Tan
Ain't ate in a week, I need 3 dinners
3 piece, thick thighs no miss, winner
Keep calling my phone ion want dis bitch
You can have yo' ho back
Deep in some water
Fuck yo fish
I'm finna throw it back
Lame ass nigga gone go for that
I'm in too deep
And I ain't talkin' bout water baby
I done told all of these bitches
I don't not no want no more kisses
I done told all of my niggas
They better get up and go get it
I done told all of these bitches and niggas
It's my indecision
And I want them racks and I don't care who go get it
Feel like I'm in too deep
