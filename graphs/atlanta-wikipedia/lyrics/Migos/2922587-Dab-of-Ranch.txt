Quavo
Money like bags of chips
Hunnits of bags I flip
Truckload backin' up (beep)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, good they smackable
Number one record, the chip breaking record so add it up
Don't grab a Snickers and go get a bag of 'em
Bag of what? Dab of Ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
We can make it happen
Get your rap snacks
We can make it snappin'

If there ain’t no more call the ambulance
My face on the chips take her out her pants
When I’m done with the bag I’m gone lick my hand
Dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
With a dab of ranch
When you get a little hungry
Don’t panic
Just dab and ranch it
When you get a little hungry
Don’t panic
Just dab and ranch it
