In the hood I'm Bill Gates
I dun ran up the money (Go, Go!)
I dun ran up my money
Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I bought a chopper for the snakes
Now I wrap my money up
Dikembe Mutumbo the block

Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I bought a chopper for the snakes

Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I feel like I'm Bill Gates

Bought a chopper for the snake (Snake, Nigga!)
I feel like I'm Bill Gates
I bought a chopper for the snakes
