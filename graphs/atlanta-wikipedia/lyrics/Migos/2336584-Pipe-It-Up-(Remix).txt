[Intro: Quavo]
'Know whatchua'll doin?
But I'm piped up
See that boy right there?
He piped up
See that girl right there?
She piped up
[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up (x8)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
I go to the club in Balenciagas, I fuck your bitch in some Jordans
I just bought a line of Actavis, I just pay like 300 for it
[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up (x8)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up (x8)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
[Verse 3: Quavo]
Quavo!
Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up (Pipe it up, pipe it up, pipe it up)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
She was a basic bitch til I piped her up
Piped up in the city
Piped up with yo bitches
Piped up in Givenchy
Piped up new edition
You know I do magic, Quavo Houdini
I touch the pack and get it missin'
[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Broke niggas still saying "turn it up!"
All my young rich niggas screaming out "pipe it up!"
Benjamins old they extinct like a dinosaur
In stores now YRN fashion
[Hook x2: Quavo]
Pipe it up (x8)
I walk in the club just to pipe it up
I stand on this stage and I pipe it up
Get a regular ho tell her pipe it up
Go buy a bando then I pipe it up
