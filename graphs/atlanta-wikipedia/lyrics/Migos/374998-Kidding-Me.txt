They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
You know that they taking your style? (must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
Who the fuck said YRN2 gon' flop? Must be kidding me
Remember back then watching Oprah?
Now I'm on the sofa with Oprah
OG gas pack got the odor
Green like Shrek that's an ogre
Pull up to your house and foreclose ya'
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
My bitch ridin' down with 50 chicks in an SRT (brrrr)
I'm richer than my teachers
With yo' red light on, in the bando get it like Krispy Kremes (go)
Hit the pot with the left hook, (skrt) Quavo-Kareem (ooh)
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
Wrapping my bitch up in diamonds from Tiffany's
Feelin' like Austin they stealing my mojo
They say the plug going out like Nino Brown
I bet I'd pull up and start dumping at the whole crowd
You know that they taking your style? (Must be kidding me)
It's all on the radio, like right now!
Who the hell said we a one hit wonder?
