Yola, payola, payola, payola
All I ever need in my life, payola
Yola, (yola), payola, payola
Yola, (yola), payola, broccoli, payola, broccoli
Yola, payola, payola, payola
All I ever need in my life, payola
Yola, payola, payola
Yola, (yola), broccoli, payola, broccoli
Trapping off of Motorolas
The plug, he in Minnesota
I got the flavors, Willy Wonka
Gotta make sure that your ticket is golden
Not the Carlito, the Migos' Way
Dinosaur, alligator, komodo dragon or Giuseppe toes
Adam Sandler, I control my hoes with no remote
You thinking 'bout robbing me
Better off shooting yourself, Plaxico
No scientist, for you snakes, I got the antidope
No Monopoly
No vending machine but I'm selling that coca
