I don't talk on the phone, I hit the jet I go see Pablo
J with the ashy knuckles knockin' at my front door
Ran out of dope you might just check with me tomorrow
green numbers like the Matrix
He mad cause I finessed him with the pack and it's fugazi
Mollies, zans, lean, oxycontins came from Haiti
Baby kids in the trunk, you know I keep them babies, gone!

In the kitchen hit it with the eggbeater
On the pan you would think my name Peter
Cold as hell so a nigga keep the heater
Bally kicks on like I'm playing FIFA
With the Migos 30 for a feature
Y'all niggas don't know what a bando mean
Y'all niggas saying "boys on the windows"
Keep the wood in my hand, got a splinter
Got the white and tan bricks in the fender
IPhone been a trap phone, Motorola

My wrist be spinning and spinning and spinning
We pullin' in Bentleys we winnin'
The Uzi, the Uzi, they shooting, they shooting
These niggas they droppin' they floppin'
My whipgame it is so anxious
We cookin' the dope like it's baking
Young Offset's still in the vacant
Them red and white, blue diamonds looking just like the Patriots
Before I sell the dope I let the J's taste it
It is amazing
