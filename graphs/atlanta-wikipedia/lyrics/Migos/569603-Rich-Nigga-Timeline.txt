First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine
17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty
you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, "it wasn't us, bruh"
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine
