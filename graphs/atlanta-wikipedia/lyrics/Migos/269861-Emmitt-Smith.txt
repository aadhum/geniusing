Young nigga running with the work, Earl Campbell
Young Takeoff and I'm finna buy Delta
Pourin' that 2 plus 2 in my Fanta
Your pockets look like they got cancer
I just bought a brand new Mercedes from Haiti and set it on some Walter Paytons

Making a trip to go get the narcotics

We not acceptin' apologies
Sellin' the dope to economies
Young rich nigga ridin' 'round in the Bentley
Throwin' money out the ceiling momma told me I'm ignant!
Smoking on gas like a nigga got cataracts
Alley oop dunking them bricks itâ€™s a Shaq attack
Only one bird can bring the whole corner back
