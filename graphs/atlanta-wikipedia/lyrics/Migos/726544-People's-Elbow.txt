My wrist like The Rock, people’s elbow
All red 'rari, there go Elmo
Choppin' bricks, Leonardo, could be Donatello
The heroin is black like puddin', Bill Cosby, Jell-O
Imma need a whole kilo, ain’t talking bout the rapper Kilo
Got bricks on bricks on bricks like Shaquille O’Neil shooting at the free throw
In the bando looking out the peep hole
Quavo, beast mode
I came a long way, finger fucking the bowl
And now I get 45K for a show
QC the label, free promo
I’m balling, Dubai, riding camels ho
Choppers on me like Osama nigga
No offense to the loss of the towers
You a gangster then you move in silence
If you talking out loud you a coward
My wrist like The Rock, people’s elbow
Flushing the dope if the boys come
Machine in my wrist like Decepticon
I got a mini 14 with a drum
Whipping up a storm, I’m bout to break my arm
Standing at the stove, cooking the Marilyn Monroe
Run to the money like Usain Bolt
Cook a nigga like a pork if the money keep on coming short
