I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
You know you’re shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don’t eat no sauce from no hoes
You too bipolar, baby you fire
I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
Booty fatter than Deelishis
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her like Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
