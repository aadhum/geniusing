Pipe up this bitch (p-p-pipe)
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch (pipe it up)
The difference between us and them, we created that shit (dab)
If it ain’t about money it don’t make sense (uh uh)
Taking a trip, I’ma give her the dick
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
niggas done turned into crickets
Pistols, hammers, AKs, bananas
Dirty Diana, on molly, dandruff
My diamonds came from Africa, like Michael Blackson
I spent 10k in Magic
Get off my grass like I’m Stanley
I’m higher than a chimpanzee
I shock the block like I’m Pikachu (shock the block)
I put that dope in her dookie chute (dope)
I had to beat it like Michael do (beat it)
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce (mud)
Dab (dab), stylish (style), these not on the shelf, you can’t find ‘em (nah)
Ice (ice), blind ‘em (blurgh), if I’m eyeing it told you I’m buying it (buyin')
