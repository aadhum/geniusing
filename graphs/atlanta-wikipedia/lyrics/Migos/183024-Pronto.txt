Place your order, need a bird pronto
I got that Juliet ain't talking Romeo
All my goons we wild boys ain't talking bout Steve-O
All the hoes they bad, cause this money on the floor
Ain't really worried bout shit no more
Running to the money like Usain Bolt
Sipping on the lean, Now I'm in slow-mo
Meeting wit the plug just to get the pesos
Can't even wait, gotta go in get the the cake
Cause momma told me to put the food on the plate
Paid in Full but my name ain't Mich
And the trap got gas, and the trap got brick
ASAP, Pronto, man a nigga got rich
I got juice, no beetles
Plugged in with Obama, trapping out of the White House
