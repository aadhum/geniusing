(Murdaaaa)
But I do wanna address you lame ass fuck niggas (fuck nigga!)
That's what I do wanna do
Stealin' my flow, huh, ain't even got no hook man!
You niggas you know, no hook, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Y'all know a fuck nigga don't rap like that man
TAKEOFF!
You rappers you wanna be thirty three still tryna copy me (Old ass rappers!)
Young rich nigga only 19 and you'd better acknowledge me (I'm only 19!)
I think itâ€™s time for extortion
Fuck nigga you know I'm a Migo
If I dont have Emmit, get poked with a razor
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Versace, Versace we brought that shit back and you niggas is lame (copy Versace)
We some young niggas that signed to no label
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof
I know that this game is dirty Smith and Wesson
You must got the rabies, you bite
You copy my swag and I like it
No lie,
Versace, it got me a fortune
Nigga's remedial, sounding like Radio
Them niggas not talking just pullin that cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter
Bullets have a nigga dancing like Carlton
