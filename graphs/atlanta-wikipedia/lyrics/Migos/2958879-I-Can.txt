Pulling up ballin' like Z-Bo
I am connected to kilos
Fifty gang members got Rico
You tried to pull up with that little bowl
My niggas pull up with that truckload
Money coming three ways like Cee Lo (three)
I keep that drink when that drought come
Takeoff from 12, it's a mile run (12)
Preach to these niggas like Farrakhan (preach)
I teach you lil niggas like Daniel Son
Old school dirty bird, Brian Finneran
