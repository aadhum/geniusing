This rap shit changed a nigga life
I'm fucking three hoes in one night
This rap shit changed a nigga life
I asked her do she wanna fuck, she said
"Aight, aight, aight, aight, aight"
This rap shit changed a nigga life
You took my chain it's aight
I bet he didn't get it without a fight
Called  the squad and they looking for him, one night
He outta sight
Northside where I came from
Put the buss down rollie Obama on
Imma keep it real shout out to the niggas who shot at me
Now I'm strapped up in the field
Migo Gang look like a army
Nat nat now we call 'em bees cause them bitches be swarming
Doing shows overseas take a flight every night then land in the morning
Plug said he got  twenty bricks for me
I'm bout to pull up, aight
I'm bout to catch me a flight in bout 24 hours I be in Dubai
Pacquiao Mayweather my diamonds fighting
It's three of the Migos we pass the ho in a cycle
hating the fact that a nigga is famous
