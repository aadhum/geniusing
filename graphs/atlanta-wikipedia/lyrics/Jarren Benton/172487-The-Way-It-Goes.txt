Holy Bible, assault, rifle
I’m high as hell like Micheal
Jackson on propofol, Tylenol,
In A spaceship on gold D's
I freebased then OD’d
then I wake up in the ER
Why am I such a retard?
Your girlfriend such a sweetheart
She gave me head in a cheap car
In the back seat, we are not alike
I’m a monster with a gun sir in a trench coat
Say one word to me wrong, then
It’s click-clack, pow-pow, 6 feet under
Yup, put a little coke in my nose
Okay, I wanna fuck Marilyn Monroe
If I can’t get the pussy I’ll be satistfied if she
Let me put my dick on the side of her toes
M.O.B., no time for hoes
After I bust, vamonos
Shout out to my homeboys who can’t smoke because they’re on parole
Get so high, forget my name
She called me Jarren, I slapped the ho, bitch this is Fred
I’m gettin’ bread like Pillsbury
The pussy can’t be real hairy
If she looks like Chewbacca with no clothes on, that’s real scary
I put the beat in a body bag, then throw that shit in the crematory
My brains on the back of a milk box
Fuck y’all, kick rocks
The way that I murdered these verses
Fuck it, you might as well say I killed Hip-Hop
So tell that hatin’ nigga he can go and eat a dick
Cause to be honest really I don’t give a shit
I got a burner for my enemies and foes
Cause I know I know I know just the way it goes
And if you see me pullin’ up in with my clique
Just know we came to go retarded in this bitch
We got no manners, no respect, well I suppose
Cause I know I know I know just the way it goes
Thank God for My Grandma’s Basement
I coulda been livin’ on the pavement
I woop a nigga's ass like Texas Walker
and spaz on hoes like cavemen
Nah nigga these ain’t Ray-Bans
Rayman
America caucasians’ favorite
Nigga, put a fuckin’ rapper on a grill with a side of collard greens and ate ‘em
I’m still tryna fuck Candy Latham, now I can probably fuck Raven-
Symoné, show up at her house at night with a side of that Canadian bacon
Yeah, As-Salāmu 'Alaikum,
Rambo gun bitch, spray ‘em
I keep a hat low like Raiden
get blown with Eddie Van Halen
Knock-knock, anybody home in my head, y’all hoes know my fuckin' brain's vacant
Bitch, I came off of a Wu-Tang
gettin’ paper like Bruce Wayne
I got an Asian ho that suck dick and do Kung-Fu like Liu Kang
Blowin' gasoline and butane
my last album had 2 Chainz
Yeah I’m tryna eat every rapper, I’m a fuckin’ beast on that food chain, bitch!
It’s Planet VI in this b-i-t-c-h and I see why I receive hate
Cause even back when I was me how they couldn’t see
Ladies wanna fuck my pockets to make love to my wallet
Instead they said if I hoppin’ on top of my dick like a rabbit
Is it a bird or is it a plane
Bitch, I’m more like an unidentified flyin’ object, I’m alien fresh
Now you can see how an alien dress
Cookin’ up raps when I’m in the both
I might as well put my hair in net
Didn’t nobody tell you that I’m crazy
And I’m insane at the same damn time
Throwin’ up V-I, please do not mistake t
And I’m a P.I.M.P., so you know that I only attract dimes
I’m number eleven on top of the Richter scale
I’m killin’ the game and spittin’ them bars
So I should get sent to jail
I’m out of your league ho
Now all I see is green, pockets on Cee-Lo
Ballin’ on these foul ass niggas, fuck a free throw
