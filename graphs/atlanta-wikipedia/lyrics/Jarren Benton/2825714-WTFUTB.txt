Bring home the bacon and broccoli
A-Town monopoly
Empire, stick my dick raw in Taraji P
Interstellar bitch like Mathew McConaughey
I'm after the throne no Baratheon
Grew up with roaches inside of my Frosted Flakes
What the fuck is you talking 'bout
I got the juice, brand new bishop and Q
My girl think I'm loyal, that bitch is a fool
R-I-P Big L, I borrowed that line
My uncle on crack, want to borrow my 9
These haters throw shade, want to borrow my shine
They switch up and transform like Optimus Prime
Netflix and chill, bitch I came for the sex
And she don't swallow cum so I came on her neck
Them haters say Jarren, you crazy you ain't gonna make it, I look at 'em
