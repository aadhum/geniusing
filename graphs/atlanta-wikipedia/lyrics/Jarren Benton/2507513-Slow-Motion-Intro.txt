Yah, they be like Jarren!
Where the fuck you've been, dawg?
I'm back nigga
K-K-Kato on the track bitch
Slow Motion, this is Volume 2
Aye Jarren what happened to Funk Volume?
Still stepping out in my Adidas
1800 in my margarita
She gon' let me give her throat a fetus
They watchin us just like the Truman
These bitches thinking imma ice they wrist
nitrous
Hey life's a bitch
And her sister's a cunt
Fuck cancer, send a prayer to Boosie
I'll kill a bitch and my dick gets cooties
moolies
All of you talking shit man
whip the colt
Never used a fucking ghost writer
vices
Pray for Paris fighting ISIS niggas
It ain't even safe up in a church
