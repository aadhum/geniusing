Through the lights, cameras, the action
Glammers, glitters, and gold
So much money that my paper won't fold
East side, that’s where I come from
Doctor Lecter, bitch
I move effortless, Actavis in my beverage, bitch
This mac’ll make a pussy nigga do a pirouette
She discovered my discography, she listens to Rittz
I gave her a couple hits and now she’s licking my dick
Yeah, smooth as a gator on a block of ice
Riding with a dime piece in a vintage Maverick
Just cause they dress like faggots, they ain’t Illuminati
