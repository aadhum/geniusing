Hopsin put me on in this bitch, I wish you the best fam
I was thinking 'bout murking the whole staff of Def Jam
Niggas sleeping on me like a muthafucking craftmatic
Counted me out, guess these faggots bad at they mathematics
Cursing God like "why the fuck You take my brother?"
Prescription pills to coke, guess I love the feel of these uppers
Arguing niggas cause Pac wasn't in my top five
You don't fuck with me hoe, you die from carbon monoxide
Fuck the small talk, my blood pressure boiling
If I wanna shoot this shit, I pop this pistol at the toilet
Put a hole in a nigga's chest just like a Yeezy shirt
Ill nigga, need a nurse
Cashing checks doing the Soulja Boy, nigga youuu!
So I'm praying with my tec in the church
I was told to bring a tec to the church and a bible to the trap
Bumping
Strange, you could say we had a tech in the church
[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
Writing curses in cursive all over your fucking hearses
I should wrap my dick around your neck and keep choking that shit, bitch
