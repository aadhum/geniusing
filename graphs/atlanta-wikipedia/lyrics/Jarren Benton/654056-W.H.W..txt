I'm like whatever
We like whatever
(K-K-Kato on the track, bitch)
She like whatever
I say wherever, however, whatever
I'm like wherever, however, whatever
We like wherever, however, whatever
She like wherever, however, whatever
I say wherever, however, whatever
Pull up on a nigga for that money like, wherever
Pull up on your bitch only for the night, however
We can shoot it out, we can fight bitch, whatever
Wherever, however, whatever
Okay, I'm back like fat bitch at a buffet
My God, Mister Benton, you're the shit I must say
Kill them all and then I peel off in the Mustang
Niggas ain't shit but a toilet bowl stain
Death to the label, disappointing y'all lames
Fuck an AK, I'll probably stick a fork in yo brains
Excuse me, bitch, while I powder my nose
While I'm gone to the bar, tell them, "bring more drinks"
Bullshit walks, the money talks
After I hit the pussy, ho, you have a funny walk
I ain't your average nigga with a gun and malt liquor
Hit a motherfucker, like a thunderbolt
I'm not a human being, I'm a poltergeist
Shoot a nigga, pop a wheelie on a motorbike
That bitch said you couldn't poke her right
So she lay the poker face, like it's poker night
I can't turnt down
Loud, got my head spinning like a turnstile
My niggas on weed, liquor, syrup and dust
Remember? Motherfuckers never loved us
It's the nine-five-three-six
Throw a chair at a motherfucker, tear the club up
I'm like wherever, however, whatever
We like wherever, however, whatever
She like wherever, however, whatever
I say wherever, however, whatever
Pull up on a nigga for that money like, wherever
Pull up on your bitch only for the night, however
We can shoot it out, we can fight bitch, whatever
Wherever, however, whatever
Okay, it's whatever, nigga, it can get ugly
Pull up in yo hood in a fucking dune buggy
Couple screws loose, bitch, I'm so nutty
Throwing deuces at a whore if she's not a dick licker
Sipping 1800 Silver
Bitch nigga better get familiar, Imma kill for my la familia
Put them in a trunk, blood in my interior
Bullets ring out, like I'm out in Syria
East side, 'til I'm floating in the deep sea
Let a mark try me like Dej Loaf
Turn his motherfucking brains in to egg yolk
Yeah, ho, you the type to let the feds know
Surrounded by a bunch of snake niggas like Destro
My niggas on weed, liquor, syrup and dust
Remember? Motherfuckers never loved us
Throw a chair at a motherfucker, tear the club up
I'm like wherever, however, whatever
We like wherever, however, whatever
She like wherever, however, whatever
I say wherever, however, whatever
Pull up on a nigga for that money like, wherever
Pull up on your bitch only for the night, however
We can shoot it out, we can fight bitch, whatever
Wherever, however, whatever
