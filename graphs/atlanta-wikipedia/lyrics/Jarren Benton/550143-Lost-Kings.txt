You a bitch if you hating on this shit
I grew up off of Southernplayalisticadillacmusik
Sip a couple light brews that might lighten my mood
At least for my baby’s sake I pray I make the right moves
Rappers you fugazi, we can see that you pretend
Butter soft, leather in the seats that I’m sinking
Niggas nothing different, same shit, different porcelain
Thank God we walked up out that abortion clinic
Old school Chevy, the windows tinted
Another homicide, 12 need more forensics
The fact is, pigs murdering black kids
And black kids murdering black kids
Ay where the value in that?
It’s like we don’t see no value in black
A fatherless habitat, moving vials of that crack
Yeah, ATLiens
Niggas still waiting on God to sky dive
Like that's our only hope to stop these drive-bys
What this nigga up to? Damn he lookin' shady
Is he casing my crib while I'm clutchin' on the 3.80?
Meanwhile he's just tryna find the local gymnasium
We assume the worse and we plant these seeds in our cranium
Damn that’s that same mindframe that killed Trayvon
But we don’t think shit bout the bitch when she selling Avon
We murder over dumb shit, still miss the big picture
How’d we go to this when we used to be kings and queens
Meanwhile the African population decreasing over bullshit diseases
Hunger and shit that’s mean’less
That’s weird, the most hated and feared
Open your third eye
Ask Malcolm, when you wake from the matrix they want you dead
