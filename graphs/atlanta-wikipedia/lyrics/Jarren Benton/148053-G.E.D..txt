[Intro: Kato]
I just got my G.E.D
So there ain't shit you can say to me
(x3)
Yeah, Kato
Jarren, Benton
4, Ize
You ever try to suck your own dick?
That shit never works do it?
Every day I wake up (yawn)
Tryna get this cake up
Smack a bitch so hard, I knock off all her make-up
Stomach rumbling, fucking rappers 'bout to get ate up
Y'all a bunch of queers, they cheering for team Jacob
Josephine Baker
blowing green acres
And I'm posted at the bar all day like I'm Norm
Clueless like a Blood in a blue uniform
And the shit I'm smoking got me seeing blue unicorns
Dick in your bitch ass, like a colonoscopy
Niggas think it's a game, cause Jarren's a monopoly
Stand between me and my paper, like apostrophe
Give niggas lobotomies,
they shittin' out colostomies
Bitches used to diss me, they ain't wanna talk to me
Jock's shoved me in the lockers cause I act awkwardly
Now I'm getting pussy like I study gynecology
So I freestyle, getting off at freedom parkway
Cut the cheque, my money long as Chris Bosh neck
fine bitches like Scarlett Johansson
Stupid like Homer (d'oh!)
With a general education diploma
My second oldest like Moses
'Cept he took two of every creature, put 'em in his freezer and he froze 'em
These hookers want my kids, caught 'em leaving with the trojan
Try and empty it with legs open
I clotheslined her in the Days Inn parking lot and now she choking
I will make an ass out of you if you ever assume
People think I'm a prophet cause I'm dressing like Socrates
Call me Jack the Rapper
