Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames
Can you stitch back a ripped heart
Or when it's gone is it torn apart?
I feel allured by the dark like Damian
Crashed on another planet, just the lonely alien
Trying to get these motherfucking doubts out my cranium
I know I'mma make it but this pain's got me caving in
These industry niggas I've developed such a hate for them
Swear I want to kill them but my momma told me pray for them
Waiting on the day when me and my niggas rocking stadiums
But we've grown apart now I cannot relate to them, nah...
Uh! Now who the fuck says life's fair?
Niggas turn their backs on you when you need them right there
Grandmama told me stress'll give me white hair
Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames
Blow an O with that L.A. weed
Feeling stressed because I fucked up with L.A. Reid
Plus I got to share the bad news with my seed
Niggas looking at me like I won't succeed, damn!
And it was all good just a week ago
Hope these pussy ass niggas decompose
Turn the stereo up and let the speakers blow
Trying to block the bullshit out blowing reefer smoke
I need to find a shrink to confide to
Why worry knowing God walk beside you
Now we're here
Standing in your tears
Nothing remains
Just fire and flames
Fire and flames
Fire and flames
