Yippie-ki-yay motherfucker nice to meet you
The game needs to change and I'm the new fucking cartridge
The rap game's Debo I'm here just to start shit
Pikachu
We about to be the fucking slumdog millionaire
I whoop a nigga's ass like Chuck Norris
Drag you through the forest
I'll eat your porridge
Your bitch tried to take a nigga on Maury Povich
I'm the father of the kids in her esophagus
Hey! Do you need binoculars to see
That you can't fuck with me
It's obvious
Ho, diddy bop and say the word swag
I'll just stick to hip-hop, rock out, and spray fags
And you do the stanky leg
Riding through Decatur
And pull a fake ass nigga's card like Gambit
I'm quick to call a bougie girl a ho like Thundercats
