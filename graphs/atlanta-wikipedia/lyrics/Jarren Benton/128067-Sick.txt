Yeah, Sick of pain, I'm sick of losing, sick of boozing
Sick of pussy ass niggas, man I'm sick of music
Sick of this fucking barber thats bringing back my hair line
Sick of niggas saying "J you need a sicker single
You know, something for the club, with a catchy jingle"
Sick of skinny jeans, I'm sipping promethazine
I throw this molotov cocktail at your limousine
Sick of being broke, sick of rappers saying "if I weren't rapping i'd probably be out selling coke"
Sick of republicans hating on Obama
Yet I'm sick of Obama,
Sick of jerkin off,
sick of ramen noodles
This is fight back music, get your moms approval
sick as Riggs on lethal weapon
Damien, eat em up for breakfast evil presence
Pack a weapon crack his melon faggots yellin tattle tellin
You niggas pussy as Ellen
I'm illy
still at it, naw nigga I'm Ill matic
Fiend of a microphones I'm a real addict
Sick of trippin, brains missing, stick the clip in, fuck this shit nigga I'm sick of living
