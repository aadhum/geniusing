How is everyone doin'? (Yeeaahh)
How to be a hooker: "Get the payment up front!" (uh-huh-uh-huh)
Hehe, is that what their teaching you in home ec when we're in shop?
Damn bitch, you so rad
Whatever you want
Just throw it in the bag
You gonna make a nigga have a heart attack
Walkin' around here with all that ass
Drop one time
I spend my last
I go home my wife goes fast:
"You stupid motherfucker
On some pussy you spent all our cash"
D-E-C-A-T-U-R G-A
That's word on my block
The way you move god damn that's cool
It'll put a dude like me in a pine box
I wonder can you go both ways?
Can you bring another girl, is it cool if I watch?
The girl bring it back like Time Cop
Hypnotize, mesmerize, electrified, by that ass and thighs
You some sort of sorceress?
I'm in this bitch again
I think I just spent up my mortgage
Do you smoke or do you snort it?
Hoes on my dick
Cause I look like Chuck Norris
Her ass so enormous
An that pussy worth a fortune
Ka-Ka-Kato killed this beat
My nigga please bring in my chorus
I SAY!
Damn she's a bad bitch I put her on attention
Her ass is like an acid tear
She got my mind trippin'
I'm up in here like every night
She got your boy trickin'
When that pussy get to poppin'
Then my dollars get to spendin'
Damn dude I am so gone
This shit we chiefin' on
Go put a hole inside the ozone
She always give me slow dome
When that dj play a slow song
I'm up in here like every night
So I can see her dance
She turn me to a stalker
I'm her number one fan
In less then sixty seconds
I've already dropped a grand
