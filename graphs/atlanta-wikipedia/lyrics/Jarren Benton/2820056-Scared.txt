Nigga I'm scared, I'm scared this drinking might take control
Becoming so co-dependent, losing my soul, just thought that I should let you know that
I'm scared, I'm scared of turning out like my daddy
Don't harbor no hard feelings, he may've made mistakes, but still glad the nigga had me
I'm scared, I'm scared my grandma gon' pass away
Any day could be her last, I tell her stay strong and fuck what the doctors say
I'm scared, I'm scared that God don't exist
Success can be so scary especially when failure's all that I know
I'm scared that my wife gon' end up leaving me
Cause I get shut down so easily, now I can see why you don't believe in me
I'm scared of gettin' my heart broken,
I'm scared I might lose another friend
Overstand above two-step it up
