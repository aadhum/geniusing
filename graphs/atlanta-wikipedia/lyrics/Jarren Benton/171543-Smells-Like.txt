Looks like, feels like murder
Smells like, tastes like murder
Feels like, tastes like murder
Must be murder
Looks like, feels like murder
Smells like, tastes like murder
Feels like, tastes like murder
Must be murder
[Verse 1: R.A. the Rugged Man]
baby butchering, bloodthirsting and body burnin’ rupturing aneurysms from your brain burstin’
I smack Leatherface and laugh at Jason
I stick my dick in that Lucifer chick that used the crucifix for masturbation
Spittin’ horrorcore since Lionel Richie was a commodore
Its 'M' for Murder Hitchcock
Yeah boy, like I’m Flavor Flav with a big clock
Dispatchin’ any competetor, you’re regular
Detachin’ your retina, the blood-shedder
My dick meat stink like pastrami
My white ass is whiter than Mitt Romney
Hillary Clinton can get her clit done with my big tounge
Have the bitch strung, once me dick swung, her lip drip cum
When I bust I leave more than your face and your mouth smothered
I leave your coach and your living room and your whole house flooded
I’m rowdy ravenous and rambunctious
Have white bitches wearin’ hammer pants dancin’ to Can’t Touch This
Lyrically you ain’t never caught a body
Lesbian orgy with Earthlings and green bitches fuckin in public
I’m on some other shit, I get aliens on a mothership suckin’ dick
I’m the best and that’s it, put me on top your rap list
Have all the dead rappers come out their graves, and do my ad-libs
Bitch, c’mon
[Verse 2: Jarren Benton]
They say you are what you eat, I don't recall eating a fuckin’ rapist
I throw a rock up in the sky and hit a freakin’ spaceship
Hey bitch, how come everytime you give me head
My dick get cut up by the seam of your braces
A grown man that still lives in his mama’s basement
I murk y'all, bitch you soft as a Nerf ball
Auto-erotic asphyxiation, choke myself when I jerk off
Put your ass in the dirt dog, created the law of Kerckhoff
But the pussy smell like Pamino's, then man that's just a turn off
I tie you to the gas stove in hell tell Lucifer turn the furnace up
Me and R.A. the Rugged, you fuckers gon’ love it
When God don’t let me in I clap his ass with this .38
Forensic scientists can’t even identify the shit that I did to the bodies
I’m probably in Illuminati
And if I go broke I’m stickin’ Kanye West for his teeth
