[Verse 1: Jarren benton]
I'm from Atlanta, i never was a fan of the hawks
Funny how niggas rally when cops kill em', but when black on black violence is through the ceiling niggas is chilling
Rappers dressin like they into fellas'
C.I.A. invented crack with a sinister chemist
brougham
Young Feces
Pull out on a stack, don't even know what a baby is
Rappers scared to say my name like beetlejuice
shocking like they seeing Zeus
