Came up from that gutter now we on, bitch
Moved out my mama's house and got my own shit
Fuck these niggas hatin', I'm on my own dick
Please don't blow my high I'm in my zone, bitch
Remember when they said I wouldn't make it
Now we get this guap, these niggas hatin'
Came up from the gutter now we on, bitch
Fuck these niggas hatin', I'm on my own dick
Codeine, soda pop, pour it up, sip it
Good afternoon, ho, Jarren back up in them bitches
Dope boy still whippin' crack in the kitchen
Nigga hungry, don't know how to act in this condition
Pray to God, he don't leave us trapped in this position
Drop a mixtape, then I hope these niggas listen
Faggot A&R with the damn criticism
I'm a fucking beast bitch this a damn lyricism
I'll slaughter you niggas
Get the DNA, fuck around and father you niggas
FV we don't want a part of you niggas
No bath salts but I'll eat the heart of you niggas
I'm appalled at, you niggas
If I ain't the shit tell me what you call this, you niggas
I'm Illuminati
I don't get involved with these niggas
Fuck around with Mr. Benton and you all get disfigured
Shoutout to my chop, A-town, bitch, come to my block
East side nigga, never hung around cops
All eyes on me like I hung around Pac
Pow! Hit a nigga with the gun in my sock
I'm high as hell, Dizzy, what'd you put in my pot?
FV twenty-one-three, bitch I won’t stop
Dizzy Wright looking nice on the low-low
Solo Dolo was the hit
You gotta admit, if I ain't the shit, what is this?
Last year, you wanna know what you missed?
Everything that got me up on the list
22, but all these grown bitches feeling a nigga
I don't talk about it if it don't exists
Niggas wanna get on but I'm a long way from going home
Going hard 'til the day that I'm old
I'm cross-fitted in Vegas
Sipping this Honey Jack shit 'til it's gone
Everybody wanna kick it in the V.I.P. with Jarren Benton and the D-I-Z
See I'mma be this way 'til I motherfucking D-I-E
She wanna party? That's cool, but let me see ID
Cause we outchea, with the rappin'
Stunting is a habit but it's fashion
I understand that a young nigga doing his thing
But I ain't fucking with the young ratchets
Yeah you think you're cool, but I been there
You been wack, I’m angry like a nigga tryna get his kids back
Heads spinning, I'mma kick back
I ain't gon' trip, yeah I'mma get it in and then dipset!
Big spliff
Cali smoke
Get ripped
Barely choke
Zip shit
Man, we dope
(___?___)
Got us off the block cause I eat off green
Heat off teens, geeked off beans
Slap a motherfucker, then I squeak off clean
Took his bitch and killed that pussy like Second Season Sopranos
Had a good run now you don't want to quit
Hit him with the butt of the clip
Gun on my hip,
Started from the bottom now I'm under your bitch
Death defying
They testifying
So it's best to fry'em
I'm the next Goliath
Remember me, the nigga that you said wouldn't make it
Got a base-side whore in the bed, butt-naked
Zac Morris nigga, I'm a problem, I'm a headache
12's in the back, got'em kicking like Pelé
Kato
on a warm day, might be in L.A.,
Nice breeze, palm trees, hanging with the esés
Heard about the gun ban yesterday my homeboy
Went and got a motherfucking SK
To me that feels mulled off, probably means Zoloft
Can't shake the problems in my life they won't roll off
Lately I've been hanging around Kaine like O-Dog
Feeling paranoid, am I tripping on all y'all
Life's in Atlanta
I might go bananas
These voices I hear
When they call me I answer
Keep feeding me rappers
I'll eat'em like cancer
I am not a human being, speak a different language
Shawty give me stupid head, call the ho brainless
Funny what these sucka niggas do to get famous
Check 1, 2, I got a couple screws loose
Niggas can't hang like a fucking loose noose
My high coming down I need a fucking parachute
Dame fucked around and let the animals loose
Yaah
