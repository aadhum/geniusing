Earth to Mr. Benton
Man these pills got me feeling like the Earth is missin’
And you so pussy you can birth an infant
Put a hit out on the booth, now show me where the mic is at
Battlestar Galactica
These niggas ain’t real they’re like Avatars and Dracula
Haters wanna shoot me out the sky like Galaga
These niggas ain’t ready homes
They are on romanic get aways with Bishop Eddie Long
Welcome to the Terradome
And I am no neurologist but your bitch gives me hella dome
And I am feelin’ so fuckin’ rad
Totally awsome dude, the best feelin’ I’ve had
But you should know we don’t need no roads
Propose a toast cause we’re on top now
Mothership Decatur blasting off-off
My shit be bumping, eardrum bleeding
C.C. Sabathia
Same shit different day, the planet still orbitin’
Marty so fly I’m pullin’ hoes in my DeLorean
Where we’re goin’ we don’t need roads
Just a gas mask, oxygene and some weed smoke
So fresh, so clean, I’m an Outkast
Suicide bomb a sucka nigga, yeah I plan to blow
The industry is a bunch of fuckin’ robots like Johnny Five
My spaceship flies alone
