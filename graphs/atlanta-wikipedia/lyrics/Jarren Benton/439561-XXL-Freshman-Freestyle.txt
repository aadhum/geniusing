I ain't scared of you bitches we can both perish inside of the same dirt
I'm right beside you we can both ride in the same hearse
A fucking weirdo, we cannot be from the same earth
I eat battery acid and shit asbestos
Fuck a fashion show, I don't argue about who the freshest
I'm a creature, I will eat you, detach a head from your necklace
Agh, I wish a motherfucking hater would
Don't make me flip
and put this heater in your mouth
Fuck eggs, I will throw Justin Bieber at your house
Making it hard to pop for your niggas like a metal cork
Throw a bucket of piss at the judge when I'm at the court
XXL! XXL! Mr. Benton on this bitch, I bet that cover go sell
Tell Lucifer step aside as I hover through hell
Make a sweater out your face like I'm Buffalo Bill
I fuck up the ozone when I'm spitting this fluid
I can't tell them to suck my dick because these haters gon' do it
Jarren
er-i-er
Benton
