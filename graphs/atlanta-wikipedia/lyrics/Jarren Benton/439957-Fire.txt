Eat beats in the booth, I'm Hannibal
Yeah, the east side cannibal
Hey yo I'm fresh like baking soda
Arm & Hammer
Pledge allegiance to the east side of Atlanta
The track need chemo
Erick Sermon gave the beat cancer
No average Joe, baby I'm Cobra Commander
Money seems promising
Hoes, they want to marry him
Fire marshal, I start fires like Drew Barrymore
Bringing hip-hop back like Bill and Ted's phone booth
Fire extinguisher in the booth is a requirement
Silence of the lambs, I murdered the mic again
Hey yo, Spittz, knock his nozzle off
I'm weird like Bjork
On some other shit like I'm Malachi Z York
All I got in this world: me and my Adidas
