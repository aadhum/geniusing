If one more fag say swag
I'm-a probably fucking gag, get mad, and whoop his ass
Haha, look at that, Jarren's irritated
I can't breathe bitch, I'm hyperventilating
Yep, it's the inauguration
Of a pessimistic rapper that's waiting to kick your face in
They say "we don't like the way y'all rap
Got a semi-automatic, better pay y'all tax"
Breakers, skaters
B-boys, haters
Oh, everybody fuck that
Still nowhere to go
Yeah, still nowhere to go
Still got bills
Past due collection, nigga that's real
Dumb nigga spent his last on some rims for his truck
And I still pray to be a legend in the game
But the vision's now jaded cause of bullshit and pain
My attitude's reckless
Snatch a rapper's necklace
And beat a nigga's ass at the drive-thru at Checkers
"Yeah nigga
Ayy, my motherfuckin' swag's so serious nigga
I wake up, I put on a motherfuckin' swag jacket nigga
I put swag motherfuckin' syrup on my pancakes nigga when I wake up nigga
Swagger, swagger, swagger, nigga
My swag this, my swag--"
(Gunshot)
Nigga shut the fuck up about your fucking swag
This is fucking music at it's fucking best
Jarren Benton
That bitch ain't fucking dead nigga I just fucking shook that bitch
Get the fuck up bitch
You ain't dead
You ain't dead bitch!
