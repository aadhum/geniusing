Terrorist on the beat, in a booth with a jacket that's filled with C-4
When this needle hit 'em they dying like Philip Seymour
Hoffman,
fucking weirdo, I sleep in a coffin
I don't sip promethazine for coughing
It's more rappers, guess I dig a bigger ditch in the Earth
Your new bitch my old bitch, I stick my dick in her first
Fuck your favorite rapper, nigga just a bitch in a skirt
Mama fucked an alien, I came out different at birth
Lord knows, I woke up in a new Bugatti with two new hotties
Rest in peace to Big L, Biggie and 2Pac
What it do, Nas? Yeah, this dude knock
Live in a glass house, but they threw rocks
So high five, guys, look on the bright side
Ain't have enough gas money to do the drive-by
Came out of my mama's vag and went and smacked the doctor
You fucking with the wrong niggas, just like Justin Bieber
I'm sick like I just ingested ether
K-C-I-D-T-A-E, bitch, spell it backwards
I'm stillmatic
Rappers sensitive like bitches on their menstrual
I show you what I been through with a pencil
Writing life on instrumentals
Kill him and put him inside off the back of a Lincoln Continental
On the fucking moon fighting martians with lightsabers like Skywalker
Stomping haters, it's spilling blood on my Timberlands
You never killed a nigga in the hood like Zimmerman, bitch
