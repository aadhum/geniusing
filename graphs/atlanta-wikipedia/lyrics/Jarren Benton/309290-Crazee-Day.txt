Spittz
you know what fucking kills me?
When I be hearing motherfuckers saying
Yo I had a fucked up day
My day this, my day that
But nigga I'm like shut the fuck up nigga
Nobody had a more fucked up day than me, you know what I'm saying?
And I ain't bullshitting about this, this some crazy shit
So y'all sit back, bring out the popcorn, and listen, alright?
Put the children to bed, pop two pills, take a couple shots to the head
Sit back and listen
Check this shit out
Raised in Decatur
Sick of this rap shit
Sick of being stuck in this Atlanta traffic
Hop out of my car
I walk to the bar
Order Hangar 1 in a real big jar
SARS
We huffed a tube of glue until we started seeing stars
Mars
I met a guy named Charles
With two wooden legs and some nasty war scars
I went back home and popped two Pop-Tarts
AllƒÅhu Akbar
Open the front door and there's my homie Clyde
I said what's up and gave him a high five
Maybe we'll get high
Maybe we'll sky dive
I looked at the clock and it's a quarter past five
My nigga's acting weird
He started scratching his beard
I started getting scared cause ooze dripped from his ear
His mouth started foaming, his eyes turned red
I grabbed the kitchen knife and stuck it in his head
He passed out dead
I grabbed him by the legs
Drug him outside and stuck him in a tool shed
Golden Girls
I know what you're thinking, he's a fucking liar
I hope he freaking dies, goes to hell and burns in fire
The moral of the story, there is none dammit
I'm a dope rapper and my name is Jarren
I vouch for myself, this guy's sick
If you got a label please sign me quick
