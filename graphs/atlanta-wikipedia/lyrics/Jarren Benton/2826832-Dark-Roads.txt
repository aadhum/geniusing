2 Years since my nigga died
1 year since a nigga cried
My whole team switch sides
Never trust a bitch, right
These niggas ain't loyal no more
Money turn these niggas into hoes
I done turned in to an alcoholic
This industry's so fucking diabolic
Lately I've been feeling so psychotic
Where were you when I was contemplating suicide?
Now I'm [?] any nigga getting euthanized
Lately I've been dancing with the devil
Money make a nigga feel special
I feel like my pain all gone
Fuck Cupid, love will break a niggas heart
Funny what a little fame'll do to ya
Lately I've been trying to keep my circle small
Right before the show we sniffing adderall
Right before the show we chugging alcohol
They see I'm a star but blinded to my flaws
