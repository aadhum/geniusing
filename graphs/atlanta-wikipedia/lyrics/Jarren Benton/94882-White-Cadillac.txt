Yeah, white Cadillac, Top off
Me, I'm in the basement
Writing in my note pad
Welcome to my dope show
No I'm not Marilyn
The city sleeping on me like a Sealy Posturepedic
Living on a pull out not a dollar in my cargo's
Shit is all the same from Decatur to Key Largo
Writing like I'm scribbling my last words
Spit it like I'm spitting out my last verse
