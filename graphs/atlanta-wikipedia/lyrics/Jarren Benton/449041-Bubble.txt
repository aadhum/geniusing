Feeling inadequate
Couldn't bring home the bacon
Baby mama bitching
The bread wasn't bakin'
Like a retired doctor I had no patience
Wait, wait, oh, woah, no, this can't be life
All the struggle, all the pain, no this can't be right
It's when I start believing in me
Like a bird soaring through the sky I'm feeling so free
Baby I'm a motherfucking east side monster
Beast in this game, you can hear his hunger
Growl in his stomach, I came from down under
I do this for Gia
Greedy like two Jews
If you hating on me, God bless you
