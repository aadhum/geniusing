East side Decatur baby
Daddy was a deadbeat, mama now strugglin'
Grandmama helped out, there was no husband
Collard greens, neck bones, bread in the oven
I'm trying to give Gia the life that I never had
Waking up in cold sweats, all a nigga got is rap
Now I'm a southern man, chitlins
Cash put the A on the map
90 percent of the rappers in the A nowadays sound wack
Stack of Benjamins in a rubber band
