My grandmas basement
Felt like there was no escaping
Some days felt suicidal
I was scared I would never make it
I got problems nigga, I got issues bitch
I don't want to live no more
Im'ma let this pistol spit
Give me a therapist
That know magic tricks
Prescribe me something, nigga change my life
I need happiness, sunshine
Darkness that's all I see
I drank away my pain and popped a few pills
I can't wait to fall
Asleep
Damn I think death is calling me
Wake up and I'm still here
Like fuck I'm too scared to die
These pills and this vodka making me feel weird
I don't hang around like I used to
Paranoid that Im'a lose her
I'm scared of what my bitch think
I know any day I might lose her
What the fuck holy shit!
I just came to this realization
Its been nine months I just noticed it
This must be a nightmare
Pinch myself, somebody awake him
I open my eyes and I wake
And I'm still right here in my grandmas basement
Noooo!
My gran'ma basement, yeah nigga my gran'ma basement
My gran'ma basement, yeah nigga my gran'ma basement
Some days I felt so scared I wouldn't make it
Some days I felt so scared I wouldn't make it
Yeah outta' my gran'ma basement, yeah nigga my gran'ma basement
At night I can't go to sleep
I feel like someone's stabbing me
Inside of my fucking heart
Just like clock work this pain grows gradually
Now its back to my grandmas basement
With all this anger and this frustration
Stress can't be complacent
There he go again getting wasted
Fuck this rap shit, it ain't happening quick enough
My homies say I shouldn't give it up
My girl bitching 'bout cash nigga
I'm strapped down to my last nigga
My baby hungry and need new clothes
And I swear they grow so fast nigga
These nine to fives don't pay enough
I'm about to hit the bank and go spray it up
I've got to get the fuck out this basement
These dreams and hopes ain't waiting up
This must be a nightmare
Pinch myself, somebody awake him
I open my eyes and I wake
And I'm still right here in my grandmas basement
Noooo!
This music ain't lucrative
Papa keep talkin that go back to school
Bitch you sounding so ludicrous
I should be thankful while laying in the basement
Instead of the pavement
You finally made it
It's your worst nightmare when you lose
And you got to go back to the basement
Noooo!
