Jarren Benton! SMKA
808, beat up blocks
SMKA, we gon’ rock
Night of the Living Dead, we want brain
Blow on a O, on that Mary Jane
Trunk trunk, raddle it, let it bang
Nostrils full of that Eddie Kane
Heavy metal that will put a crack on that dome
Cash rules everything nigga, Wu-Tang
UFO with the triple gold D’s and the 20’s in the back kick Liu Kang
Suicide doors, Kurt Cobain
