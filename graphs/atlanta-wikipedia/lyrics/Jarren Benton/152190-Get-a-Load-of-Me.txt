I'm 'bout to give the game a douche and a manicure
Blowin' green in the air like Captain Planet and Planeteers
I'm not a human I'm the reaper in the flesh
Heres a picture of my brain tell me have you niggas seen it
They hear us knockin' but won't let us in
Hey tell them bitches Jarren's back for revenge
And get a load of me now
They just shit on me piss on me spit on my grave
Laugh behind my back but in my face get a load of me now
Chuggin' PBRs, screw Bud Light Beer
I got a date with your mom and I'm plannin' to cum
So what the fuck's a Maybach to a nigga that can teleport
What's this blue shit in my pot, nigga I'm Gargamel
Jedi Mind Tricks like Vinnie Paz and Darth Vader
If you ain't bullet proof, duck when the gun pop
Lost one of the illest spitters, the night that Pun dropped
Uh, I'm a motherfuckin' animal
Saber tooth tiger I'm splittin' your fuckin' cantolope
Have your town full of ghosts like a proton pack
