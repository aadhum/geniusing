Yeah
It's a dedication bitches
Outkast
Niggas get jacked like Daniel
I told you that bitch ain't dead nigga
I'm up late night like I'm on a telethon
Performing open heart surgeries on microphones
I try to touch a nigga's soul through his iPod
Never slung rocks
Before flip phone sales
Before toothpaste was gel
Before [?] mall had a store called Zales
Before you told your sister "I'm-a tell"
My throat provided hope
A real King like Don
Or Juan
In the square I circle you Urkels, I whoop your ass
johnson
So you're lyin'
I'm a lion
And you're fucking with my pride
Go Goliath and David at the same time
Samson with no hair
