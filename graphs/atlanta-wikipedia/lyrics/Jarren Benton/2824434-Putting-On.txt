Hopsin said fuck the label
Dizzy he stuck with Dame
SwizZz working on his album
And me, bitch I'm still insane
Prefer the money over fame
fame is such a cool thing
Used to stand by the stove when the heat was off
The preachers couldn't reach me what Jesus taught
That's the same language that kept the slaves in line
These fuck niggas all wear the same designs
I'm still the shit through the change of times
the feelings
I put a hundred in her thong
Izods
running in place
