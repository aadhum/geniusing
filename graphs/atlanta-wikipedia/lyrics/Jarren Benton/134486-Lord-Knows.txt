Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah, Underneath the city lights
Depression killing niggas losing sleep cause I ain't feeling right
Popping pills and drinking more feeling uninspired lately
Daily I been going through it drowning and I'm losing focus
So I play it super cool hope these niggas never notice
Uh Lord have mercy on my soul I just gotta make it 9 to 5
I do it for my kids, This the realest shit I ever wrote
Bitch I'm still standing sucka nigga I ain't done yet
Baby mamma PMSing just fucked up a niggas day
Talking to my dad kept it short cause I ain't got shit to say
Hardly know each other so we let relationships decay
Mama hurtin' I wish I could take the pain away
Life can be a bitch it's never palm trees and rainbows
they say nothing last forever
Until they close the curtain
and I wake up paranoid
Because these nightmares reoccurring, success is never promised
