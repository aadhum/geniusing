Don’t act like y’all never fuckin’ heard of me
Smilin’ in my face but wanna murder me
Leanin’ gasoline, bitch we gonna burn it up!
Scrape Tanqueray in my cup
Lace it up and then light Up
PBR ‘n Budweiser
Eastside, Quentin Tarantino
Gettin’ head in a old gran torino
Made that pussy pop for a C note
Made that pussy sing like Cee-Lo
Desert Eagle
check a nigga ego
Kickin’ down your door with my amigos
'Bout to throw some D’s on a Regal
Half a gram of coke inside my pea coat
Sayonara, hasta luego
My nigga move blocks like legos
I’m on the same shit they put on Eggos
Waffles, syrup, l'eggo
Them stinkin’ whores they wouldn’t date a nigga
Now they wanna fuck because my paper bigger
Go slit your wrist with a razor, would ya’?
Lights, camera, these niggas actin’
These rappers faggots, I’ma fuckin’ smack ‘em
I’ma fuckin’ spazz, and I’ma fuckin’ stab ‘em
Goin' Charles Manson, I’ma fuckin have ‘em like...
Sippin’ on Mad Dog 20
I’m goin’ full ‘tard like Timmy (TIMMY!)
Slip a lil of somethin’ in her Remy
The way these niggas actin’ need a Emmy
Smilin’ in your face so friendly
Throw a Molotov into your Bentley
Don’t fuck with Mr. Benton ho,
comprende?
Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning
Get hit when I wake like hello bitch hi good morning
She don’t care when I call her bitch or a ho
Cause she don’t speak no English, my bitch is a foreign
Really, how? You hadicapped bitch
You Quadriplegic, no legs and no arms
It's Funk Volume bitch, and i ain't got the patience
I came from the bottom, and popped out the basement
I disfigure niggas, let’s play Operation
Doctor said date ‘em
the Martians invadin’
I stunt on these hoes
Jason Statham
Okay, I’m reloaded, I’m fuckin’ erase ‘em like...
