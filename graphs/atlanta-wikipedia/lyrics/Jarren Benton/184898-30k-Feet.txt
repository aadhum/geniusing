30000 feet, bitch I’m up in NASA
I’ve got prostitutes and cocaine, it’s a party in mi casa
She just wanna dance so she gives me head to Kesha
Do the dougie on my dick and when she finish I don’t kiss her
Ridin’ down the street with your baby sister
All white everything, I call that shit Hitler
Hoes say I’m jewish cause I do not tip the strippers
Even though I probably stiff her, I still take her home and stick her
Hello bitches, Jarren’s home, now what the fuck is dinner
Teenage Mutant Niggas, we don’t fuck with Master Splinters
And blame it on rats, bitch I got rest
And if that pussy gives applause, that mean that bitch has got claps
Ridin’ in a Lac, sippin’ on some yack
Gettin’ fucked by Lisa Turtle, told that bitch to call me Zack
Kato on the track, and yeah this beat’s a maniac
Bitch act like you on quantum leap and bring that ass back
I don’t fuck with AFLAC, bitch you know it’s Geiko
My nigga Elz Jenkins movin’ weight just like it’s lipo
Don’t us make pop the trunk, we got them sawed off rifles
Bitch I’m 30000 feet but don’t fuck with me cause I’m psycho
We like the best in east Atlanta
Niggas talkin’ otherwise, then move ‘em to Savannah
Pinky ring looks like I can summon Captain Planet green
Diamonds and the other one like the Green Lantern
Push your wig back, Flo Rida’s hair line
