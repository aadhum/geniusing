It's my time, and I ain't losin'
Feet glued to the earth and I ain't movin'
Fuckin' monster
The game's mutant
Pray for death to rappers makin' lame music
I'm sittin' in flames
I'm sick in the brain
I'm slittin' my vein
This prick is deranged
They're sayin' that Jarren is strange
This energy can't be contained
Somethin' I cannot explain
I will not lose
