A-T-Lien, East Side Cyborg
I am so high in the sky, like "hi, Lord!"
Rap game's dinosaur
I am such a carnivore
Cannibal, Hannibal, glutton, yeah I want more
Encore, unsure, Jarren's not-- okay
Interruptin' niggas on the stage like Kanye
Nights I felt hopeless, lonely as an orphan
Dude, if you sick well meet Dr. Kevorkian
Yeah I'm-a torture them, welcome to my horror show
Live life fast like there is no tomorrow yo
Hop into that hovercraft, yeah bitch we 'bout to go
Five seconds 'til detonatin' we are 'bout to...
On his own island baby it's no Gilligan
Popped out that grave like thriller, there's no killin' him
I am such a bully,
nigga this is my millennium
They say that he sound like Andre 3K and Eminem
Give 'em something different with a side of cyanide
If you say "fuck me", pussy nigga it's likewise
Nigga this is suicide, hip-hop heart rot
Shawty said she's celibate, this is where the car stop
Nightmare on Elm Street, niggas sleeping on me, they dead
You rappers such a geek, like screech, you so lame
Bitch we want one thing
We smoking on that ugly green, call it swamp thing
