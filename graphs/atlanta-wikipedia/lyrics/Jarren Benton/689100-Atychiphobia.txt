I done risked my life for this so fuck some
Lame ass fuck nigga saying he ain't feeling me
That shit just made me stronger
So keep on shooting bitch you ain't killing me
I still wake up worried like fuck it
And it's back to them bullshit 9 to 5s
And them niggas behind your back laughing
Like, where the fuck did I go wrong
Fight suicide thoughts like hold on
Too much pain I need an oxicodone
Some die young, didn't get a chance to
Live their dreams, just a bullet from a 9 millimeter
Going in your head like shampoo
Live great for my kid's sake
Spit pain over mixtapes
And you find out who your real friend
Cause when shit gets tough and them niggas turn away then that shit's fake
Last year I had to shed a few tears
Lost a good friend, had to pour a few beers
And everytime you hear me I'm trying just to wind the clock back and keep my 15 minutes of fame
Knowing every second that the clock ticks a million other people trying to take my spot and get in the game
This is all I've ever wanted and it's all I know so I gotta hold on
I gotta do it for my family, I can't let them down, I'm so afraid to fail, but they think I'm so strong
But I got Atychiphobia
I got Atychophobia
I got Atychophobia
But I got Atychophobia
The music is strange and the singers are dangerous
I'm feeling immortal and popping like Orville
