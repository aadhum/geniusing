K-K-Kato on the track, bitch
Bitch, we got it popping, nigga, hallelujah
I woke up feeling great, nigga, hallelujah
Came up out the
dumps, nigga, hallelujah
You know we getting to it, nigga, hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah
Came up out the dumps, nigga, halleluja, hallelujah, hallelujah
Y'all don't want these boys to bring them problems to ya
Yeah, Benton season
Getting sloppy toppy, while I'm sipping riesling
Foreign hoes, one North Korean, that's Kato's sister
Bitch, I'm sicker than Adolf Hitler, the K gon' lift ya
Pain in the ass, like an anal blister
I kill a rapper, let the angels get ya
Age of Ultron
four
crashing in the Aston Martin
Yeah, that's Aston Martin
Word to Tommy, Cole, Pam, and Martins
And if it's three stripes, then Imma probably cop it
Niggas praying on my downfall
Hadouken niggas, shoot a fire ball
Free my nigga Flick James, bitch
I'm always on that Rick James shit
This FV, we set the trends and y'all fuck boys on that same shit
[Verse 2: SwizZz]
Hallelujah, fucking loser, howdy, Jarren, toss me the Ruger
I scrub my ass with a purple loofa
Got a few cucumbers inside my juicers
So, hey, girl, come take a sip of this shit
When youâ€™re done, kiss the tip of my dick
Five-O, I am on the grind,
My girl left, but that's fine
I pop a matic, get itching, look
Too many people going crazy, zany
I burn this shit down
You see where I'm going, so now you start to come around
Fuck you,
you had your shot
Now sit back and witness, I climb to the top, bitch
Shut the fuck up, I'm paranoid and I'm buzzing
My homies now, I can't trust them
Betrayal's now the new custom
The pain is deep, but I'm accustomed
At the end of the day, I still love them
No space for hate in my heart, that can wait in the dark
Funk Volume, we coming, hallelujah
Bitch how the fuck you not feeling me?(feeling me)
Puffing and feeling real friendly
Swagged out like Leni Kravitz
Getting money I don't know why y'all laughing
Make more than you just off collabing
Elevated like Aladdin
Hold on let me switch the style let me getcha
Taking off with just me and my niggas
Bad bitch with her legs wide open
Plus some weed please she said enter
I'm just trying to get inside you
I'm the only one that could convince her
Riding 'round town sin city living lights
The true guy, Black John Lennon
Chase bank account, got commas in it
Jumped in my whip and I was backing out
