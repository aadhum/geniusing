God bless the dead
I war with demons inside my head
Now there is empty space here inside my bed
That you're missing from, I wasn't piling bread
And I was scared of this rap shit
So everyday I would practice
And our relationship would then fall apart
Now it's over now sings the fat bitch
And you was thinking about marriage
And I was thinking about me
And my shit was so far from being together
I was out here blind on these streets
Trying to beast a rhyme over beats
And these pussy niggas so weak
And my city felt so lame then
And I was stressed not getting much sleep
And my mind was thinking so fucked up
I  put hip hop before anything
A lost king though I was finna reign
But for you it's something I can not explain
And I was fighting so much disbelief
And these pills can bring much relief
And I just wanted to be in them flashy lights
With them shining chains and that mink
Yeah I've been on my grind
Lately I've been losing my mind
I pray that everything will be fine
The sun don't always shine
Nigga know that I'm a get mine
They tell me that it's all about timing
Bitch I was meant to be in them flashy lights
And them shining chains and that fur coat and them diamonds
Diamonds, fur coat and them diamonds
Diamonds, fur coat and them diamonds
God bless the dead
And I just wanted to be in them flashy lights
With them shining rings and that mink
That's why everyday I'm on my grind
Getting to the top stay on my mind
So I'm a get rich or die tryin'
Giving my everything as if it ain't no tomorrow
