Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there’s no one left (Buku, buku!)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew)
No MC can test (Bo bo bo bo)
Wishing my nigga was alive and his death was a fucking sick joke
I wanna give y'all me but these niggas just want a skitzo
Daily I feel like I'm under-rated
Middle finger up to the 17 year old kid
Who think that Kendrick, Cole and Drake are the only ones spitting shit
Don't be a fucking sheep
I'm hearing shots in my sleep, I wake up and it's me
Behind the barrel, my own blood seeping out my apparel
Step into a world (Klaka klaka, klaka klaka)
Where there’s no one left (Buku, buku!)
But the very best (Klaka, bo bo, BDP crew)
No MC can test (Bo bo bo bo)
