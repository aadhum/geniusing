Statlanta, Statlanta..
I'm my favorite too
This is Zone 3 speakin, Stat Quo stay cheesin
Ice you never dream of
Statlanta, oh yes, the one you should believe in
blowin purp out the dutch (out the dutch)
(I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)
Hey (I'm fresh, dressed, like a bil-I'm-I'm)
(I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)
Hey (I'm-I'm fresh, dressed, like a billion bucks)
Is he the street-est of the stret niggas? (Nope!) I ain't tryna be that
I'm just tryna get scrilla my nigga, shawty relax
I don't fire up a match, I know you wonder what I pack
Just know it's jet black, fully loaded, buddy act
I ain't tryin to be a gangsta but I will cock it back
To defend my folk, I'll be forced to react
A-Town A-Town
