OHH! Stat Quo! Here we go!
C'mon, c'mon! You ready? (heh)
Let's do it man (uh uh uh uh-uhh)
Shady Aftermath
The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Dateline
By, my, side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's - by my side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's - by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
