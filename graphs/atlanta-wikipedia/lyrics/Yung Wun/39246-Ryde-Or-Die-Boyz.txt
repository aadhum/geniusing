We read emcees like TV's with captions
I hate cops, and I like you even less
Niggas talk hard, and get an easy death
All talk, no show, Jerry Springer
I don't care if you a skinny or a burly nigga
I'mma have ya face lookin like a blurry mirror
I straight grew up, I'm still a bully
Used to take your lunch money now I steal your jewelry
Don't make me reach for these, I got heat to squeeze
Make your face melt like pizza cheese
And y'all niggas all sweet, like candied yams
