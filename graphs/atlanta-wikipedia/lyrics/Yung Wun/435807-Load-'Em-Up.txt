Load 'em up, let's ride
Somebody's gonna die
Why?
I'm coming straight up out the hood nigga
You can ask anybody, who got the guns nigga?
I play around with big guns and fuck nuns
On a daily basis, I bet you think I'm crazy
I'mma break your billboard and replace it
Aim my nine to your melon, bitch I snipe you who tellin'
My brother's life was precious and bitch you took it so selfish
Bitch be careful 'bout big weapons, little sister gonna getcha
