I know my momma proud you can call her Penny
Fuck her from the back I turn her like I’m Timmy
I have my brother with me just gave me kidney
Brother with them chopsticks like they eat at Beni’s
And my Macs with em I ain't talking dell
Brought the beans with me like I’m even Steven
Like a dog pissing, now I’m leaning, leaning
I’m on a mission (on a mission)
I’m going through a line like I’m fishing
My money gettin' like Tayshaun with the Pistons
Put a mill on the Bentley I ain't talking biscuits
My bitch so bad she should be in an exhibit
Reggie
I will never retire like I’m Kobe
I know some trappers stay with the 40
With the big nose on the front like Ginobili
I got a couple models look like Naomi
