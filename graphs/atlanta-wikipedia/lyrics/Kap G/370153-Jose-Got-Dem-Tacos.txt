I need a plug, no iPhone charger
Ayy fuck a middle-man, he need that direct connect
One call, that's all, we going to the border
Pat him down, if you're wild I'mma fucking shoot ya
Cut off your head, throw it in the fucking Chattahoochee
Look at me when I'm talking to you, this game ain't made for no motherfucking coochies
Them tacos coming to America like Eddie Murphy
If you ain't snitching homes, then your ass don't concern me
Early morning fiends lining up, no Jordan Concords
Cayenne wrist game
It's time to geek
My nigga
Police raided in his house like he from LA
Now he ain't never coming home like he in 3rd base
Turns out they killed my partner's wife and kids, no Damon Wayans
