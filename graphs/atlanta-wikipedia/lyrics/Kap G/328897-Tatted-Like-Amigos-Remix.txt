[Intro: Kap G]
Shouts out to College Park
Those folks get at your neck
Mi amigo is the connect, Comcast internet
Yeah they got that work, straight from Mexico
So get your sharp and call ready just like radio

[Hook: Kap G]
Okay qué pasa mami, hit a cart-wheel
She like the way I sling that D, no cartel
Okay qué pasa holmes
And you don’t want problemas
And we about a hundred deep, all my niggas all my niggas
Tatted like some migos, es amigos
All my niggas
All my niggas
Tatted like some migos
Tell me what's you on? my fam ain't gotta mow the lawn
Got a yellow bone from Mexico, don't eat pussy on Ramadan
Got your mamacita in the kitchen whippin' up chorizo
Kickin' bitches like immigration did my cousin Beto
I got strong blunts, I'm lifting weights
I dont rock fake J's, dont hit me with no ticks
These bitches love me like I'm Jodeci
Who spends thousands on ink?
Got my first lead when I was nineteen homie
Look at my face, think I need a shrink
No shirt I covered everything, tatted where I blink
Twisted stink, you talkin' to a real stoner
And a new crib owner
Smoking weed gettin' tatted, while I do a quick phone her
Thats your girlfriend homie, thats cool I dont want her
She with us getting ratchet, she came back to you tatted
Big lungs you a baby smoker
I got Pimp C on my sleeve
