Mexico mamma came from, College Park I came from
Migos
in the kitchen and they whippin' with the apron
You think they want to be doing that shit?
But shit they got payments
Don't come to me I Can't pay your Metro PCS Payment
She pregnant, man damn dog, you didn't use no latex
She be fucking up your bank account call that not practicing safe sex
And your girl, she basic
Freddy Krueger the instrumental
I just want some good cabeza
Don't really talk to much, Jordans I buy too much
I don't really wear Louis shoes or Prada shoes, they cost too much
