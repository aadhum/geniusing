Young Kap G Dinero
Yea I'm just coolin' with my vatos (vato, vato, vato)
And I just left trabajo (work, work)
Finna cash this checke, Wells Fargo (finna cash this checke)
No cash no convo.
Everybody around me, mi hermanos (my brothers)
It ain't gotta be Cinco de Mayo, I still be coolin' with my vatos
It's just me and my vatos x4
I'm just coolin with my vatos
True Religion cargos
I wake up to a lot of Gin and (?)
I'm just tryna be a legend like El Santo (the wrestler)
I was stackin' green, and now they call me Rajon Rondo
We just a bunch of head honchos
And we don't mess with them Narcos
They so strapped like
Pancho (Pancho Villa)
Tengo diez y nueve a√±os
Stackin' pesos like the Eiffel (Tower)
