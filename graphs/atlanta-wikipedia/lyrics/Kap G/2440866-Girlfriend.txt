I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
I think that I'm done with your girlfriend
All up in my business, she been lurkin'
I've been tryna to tell her bye, it ain't workin'
See I met her at the Lenox, she was tryna buy some Jimmy's
And I got on Gucci like burr
Shawty you gon' have to shave the fur (cut it off)
And I might come ballin' like I'm Stephen Curry
Space Jam, Bill Murray, Munchies, Oreo McFlurry, whoa
Work at the Blue Flame she doin' tricks up on that pole
I'ma pass her like I'm Kyrie Irving
Why you tryna flex like you a virgin?
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
Get out my lane, that's candy paint
Look where I came, from Marta trains
Look at my game, I'm like King James
I'm making movies, just like the Wayans
Fuck what she sayin', she want a ring
Pimpin' ain't easy, Big Daddy Kane
Hundred on the dash like I'm Dame
She wanna take trips to Romane
Call me David, I'm the one to blame
Why you tryna fuck with me babe? You got another guy
Blowin' on the gas from the Amoco
And she thick and she pretty (like who?) like Amber Rose
I just smoked a blunt with your girlfriend
