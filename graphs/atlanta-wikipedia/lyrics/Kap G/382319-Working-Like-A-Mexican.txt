Okay I'm working like a Mexican
'Bout 50 men and just one caravan
'Bout 50 men and just one caravan
I talk that real spit, like saliva
them [?]
I'm in that Honda 88, Tony Gonzales
And young migo kickin' shit, Jorge Campos
Fire like habanero
It's young rich migo gettin' money like I'm Heisenberg
Sellin' tacos en la cancha
