Once upon a time in barrio
Papa got his work out, cardio
Posted with vatos tryna get paid
Vatos ain't his vatos, shotgun to his brain
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Papi R.I.P, they gon' D.I.E, we fighting for territory
Take they laboratory
Paco el Jefe got bricks like a realtor
I can't fuck with snakes like the game on Nokia (telephone!)
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
I bust in his casa, I grilled him, picado
Told you I was gonna find you
You killed my fucking father
Cocaina whipped in cocina
Strong arm, John Cena
Take his dough, pizzeria
Disrespect not tolerated
Not in my house, Dikembe Mutombo
Head honcho, keep a tech, Bobby Boucher
Smoking them pounds you would think I do reggae (Bob Marley!)
Made migo like Geoffrey, no fresh prince, I'm el jefe
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Got Lindsay for the Lohan

My young boys be working
My bitch got addicted to Chanel and Birkins
I get it for the low, make it double up
Pretty se√±orita, call a couple up
Stuff it in ya bra, call that double cup
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
Cocaina, coca shawty
