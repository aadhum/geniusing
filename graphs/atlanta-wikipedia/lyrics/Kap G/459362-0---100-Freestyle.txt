They be on that rap to pay the bill shit
Got a couple partners on the trap to pay the bill shit
I Am Legend, Will Smith
You worry about that lil’ shit
You shop at the mall, and buying fake J’s, these real kicks
Construction work, we built this
You can’t even fit my shoes yet, you a size 6
My partners dominate the block, Shaquille O’Neal shit
