Gucci Mane and Zay and we stealing this shit
Half a million dollars
Paid that for my car
You touch one of mine
I'll take ten of y'all
She got no panties ain't got no bra
She got a hippopotamus bottom
Her waist is small
Me and my girlfriend ain't got no type
We shoot you big or small
I got on all this jewelry
I feel like Prince Charles
Wrist black man white girl Charles Bark
I ain't never stood in line for no Micheal Jordans
I'm buying choppers for my army
Shootouts at the border
Kevin Garnett earrings look like Fiji water
He want a nine, I take two out
So that's a kinda quarter
Man I need some lean call Phil call em quick
Call him now call him motherfucking now It's a bitch
She said she never seen a clique smoke a pound so quick
My watch on bling and your bitch on dick
Pulled up in a truck my H girl got sick
I don't need no sucker standing by my six
Got a charger with a bodykit it bout to have a big
Trunk going crazy man I'm bout to take your bitch
Bankhead bouncing to the bouncing
All this Polo on me think it's Jojo in this bitch
And my plug brick so low low
You probably make Meechy have a fit (free Meech)
Gucci arm so jiggy I treat Iggy like Miss Piggy
And TI Yo Gotti and Jeezy remind me of Pretty Ricky
Gucci arm so jiggy I treat Iggy like Miss Piggy
And TI Yo Gotti and Jeezy remind me of Pretty Ricky
Working through the burglar bars
Four square kickers
Forgiato lip stick
Bouldercrest swag with that Zone 6 shit

clique
Rather invest in some bricks
32 ENT Bricksquad in this bitch
