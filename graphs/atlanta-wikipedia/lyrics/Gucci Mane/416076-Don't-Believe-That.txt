I gotta homie named Frankie last name Mueller and he hang with my panky ice cooler
If another hater try to take my jewelry ima probably have to go and pick a jury
When I be a grand dad I tell my grand children when I was 30 years old I had 30 million
Came a long way from trappin in a vacant building 60,000 people screaming such a great feelin
It is not that easy you goin to have to try harder to decieve me
I'm still ridin around tha city with the .40
told her get her mouth ready
Paid em and I bring em in start out friends and end up fuckin
