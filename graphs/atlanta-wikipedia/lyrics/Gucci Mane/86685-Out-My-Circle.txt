Yeah, my favorite color purple
Sippin' on that purple, smokin' on that purple
You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle
Yeah, my favorite color purple

You ain't got that get the fuck up out my circle
Bitch get the fuck up out my circle
V-Nasty alley oop the brick and I slam the shit
I'm kinda country when I talk, you understand this shit?
I'm not romantic but I cook my dope candle lit
I ain't helpful for these hoes like a cancer stick
I never say never so I might be cookin' dope again
Purple Drank, Purple Lean, Purple Pills, Purple Label
Bitch its Nasty
Said I'm high off the liquid
Lean queen aka the Brick Kid
At ya front door
Got whole bricks, cos I'm sippin'
You know me girl, I'm rollin' up the purple stuff
High of the lean
At night in the hood, rockin' with my 40
Knocking at ya window, 3 in the morning
30 city trip, ho I be touring
Take a bitch money while she on vacation
Why you saying I ain't mobbin', cos im Caucasian?
