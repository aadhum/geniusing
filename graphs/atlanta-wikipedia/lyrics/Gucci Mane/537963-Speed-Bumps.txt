Blocks in your tires and you can’t peek the meters
You niggas know that i don’t fuck with Jeezy
It was tragic, wars everywhere, they say the boy was bleeding
Pocket full of dollar bills
On the real, I buy the deal
I push weight like I’m in the gym
None of y’all niggas got better dope
None of y’all niggas got better pills
