Shitting on all you hoes tonight, my bitch, she need some baby wipes
Shitting on all you hoes tonight, my bitch, she need some baby wipes
Some baby wipes
Shitting on all you producers, man Zay he need some baby wipes
It’s Gucci
I need some baby wipes
Versace bags and glasses shoes and belts, that’s what my lady like
My bitch ball hard but you broke hoes ain’t got nowhere to stay tonight
I’m whining the Lambo on Ocho Cinco bitch, that's 85
I’m cooking dope, I’m selling kush I feel like it’s the 80’s life
I told that yellowbone thick chick to get here, I didn't say it twice
I got them stupid bands I told the dealer man don’t say no price
Them brick squad niggas done for flexing hard I got on all my ice
I’m in the Phantom Ghost
Put them hands on the nigga, E. Honda
Watch a squad nigga ball throw cash
458, Gucci just passed
