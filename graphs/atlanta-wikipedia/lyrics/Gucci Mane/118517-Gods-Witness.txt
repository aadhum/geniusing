Big fat rich nigga, call me Refrigerator Perry
And your girl's a freak and I’ma leak it, I can’t keep a secret (Fuck It)
40 thou for a brick now and that's not even taxin
Your nigga lost cuz he got on a Movado watch
I pistol whip the boy that bring the message
Black nigga but I gotta stab like I’m Mexican
Popped two mollies and it boosted my adrenaline
Say I whip the nigga with a pool stick
You can jump in front of these bullets and act like you a Braveheart
