Baby keep me on my P's,
let's break down 100 P's
Gucci gas go 33 but gotta get 30 P
I don't even need a reason to hit you with the heat
These shoes don't come out this season, but still they on my feet
listen up to the story I tell
I'm in the kitchen, counting up benji's
Yo bitch washing dishes and wrapping up fishes
If I fuck with ya, I'm making you straight drop
If I don't know ya, I'mma get ya rerock
Got a bando in Boston
The way I pitch them 8-balls, shoulda played for the Red Sox
Bought a brand new A-P, but I'm always late
Tryna hit my blunt, tryna sip my drank
What the fuck you think?
Ain't shit soft around my way
Unless you talkin' 'bout cocaine
