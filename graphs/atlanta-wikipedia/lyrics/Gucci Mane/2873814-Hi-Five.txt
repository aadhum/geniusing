If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon shoot you
Dive off in that pussy like a deep sea diver
Fuck yo jam of the week, I put grams on the street
So much money, gave metro a hundred grand for the beat
Put my bone in her mouth, told her bon app√©tit
I done sold so many keys they should deport me to Belize
Cause I'm shining on these niggas like a desert with no trees
I got nine rides
