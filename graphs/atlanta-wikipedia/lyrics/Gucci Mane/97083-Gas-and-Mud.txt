It's low down Gucci, steal ya bomb Gucci
Remember when I used to drive an old ass hooptie (fuck it)
Gas packed shawty, dirty cup shawty
And why they call it Mountain Park
It ain't no God damn mountain
I was raised in sun valley wasn't a damn thing sunny
And I can't lie I try to serve every God damn junkie
Smoking gas and drinking mud but you can keep your Budweiser
She's a blunt begging bitch so I don't wanna stand by her
If you pour your ounces up then I don't wanna drink with ya
If you ain't gettin' money I don't wanna link with ya
I bring the pot to the water I could kitchen sink with ya
I had to kick you out the squad, you was the weakest link nigga
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane
4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast
The pack just came in, you know this shit the gas
Mud, mud, gotta keep it mud
800 a pint nigga, I can't show you love
Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud
I might pour the whole pint, cause I don't give a fuck
I'm a drug dealer, real killer, mean mugging fuck niggas
And if you really wanna go to war then I don't give a fuck nigga
And I pull that pistol fast PRPs hang off my ass
Remember 1996, the year that I robbed my connect
I just drunk two pints today tryna drink the pain away
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane
4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast
The pack just came in, you know this shit the gas
Mud, mud, gotta keep it mud
800 a pint nigga, I can't show you love
Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud
I might pour the whole pint, cause I don't give a fuck
Love drankin' dirty, woke up really late
Drinkin' on this Actavis, I love to drank the grace
They catch you with these pints my nigga you might catch a case
I'm the boss and I ain't takin no losses
Smoking gas, and I'm sippin' on poison
Pull the arm and I'm a hit my target
Caught a body but I beat my charges
Two Ferraris I got twin horses
New charger and I sat it on forges
G5 touchdown on Moreland
Poppin' pills like I hear voices
Me and Scooter just brought twin Porsches
Louie Vuittons, but I wear em like forces
Burberry, my boxer shorts is
Sun valley that's where my heart is
26s so I'm sittin' real high, ride in the sky same place my lord is
Gas, gas, you know I got the gas
93 octane
4 thousand for a bag
Gas, gas, sell it really fast
The pack just came in, you know this shit the gas
Mud, mud, gotta keep it mud
800 a pint nigga, I can't show you love
Mud, mud, you know I'm drinking mud
I might pour the whole pint, cause I don't give a fuck
