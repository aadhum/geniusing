I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
I stay high like giraffe pussy
In My Trap House
Smokin' bubba kushie
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Prices low like Walmart
Bricks on aisle 9 get ya shopping cart
