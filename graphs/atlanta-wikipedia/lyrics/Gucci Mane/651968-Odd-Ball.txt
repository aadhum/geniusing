Oddball, oddball
Baby girl you know that you's an oddball
Fuck with you you know that I'm an oddball
VVS' in my ears are golf balls (bling bling!)
My money getting so old I need some moth balls
My motor's in my trunk I drive a weird car
I'm a trap star I'm labeled as an odd ball
Ain't it odd that I drive a Dodge I'm in love with Dodge
Got a Challenger and Charger
and I'ma need a charge
For my Lamb and my green Ferrari and I missed a top
Hickory Dickory, special delivery
A box full of currency it's Gucci I'm mailing me!
No interior decorator but I got curtains in my Bentley jeep
In a red two seater
On the pedal is a creature
Smoking thousand dollar reefer
Quarter million dollars on an all orange Fisker
Somebody girl finna end up missing
Mean mugging us cause his bitch want pictures!
