I can make a duece duece do some crazy things
Choppa with me, I might do some crazy things
That dope so good it make a snorter catch some crazy dreams
I like to stay down with my ho so now I'm crazy paid
My credit working, make it double, I'm cashin crazy plates
I'm from the middle of the city like a grady baby
Einstein what you sayin, go bout what it say on the papers
Might move to Oakland just to watch a game of the Raiders
When I go to table you can tell that I'm hunting
My stomach get craving, it's smelling them hundreds
I didn't have no daddy to bring the bacon so i brought home the baking
I don't even pay the rent cause always overpay
