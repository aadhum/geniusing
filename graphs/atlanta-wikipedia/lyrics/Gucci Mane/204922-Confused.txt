Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
Oxy got me too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Took her out and dicked her down
But she didn't show no gratitude
Forgiato tennis shoes
Smash, smash
No cuffing, pass her to the crew
Drinking lean and smoking kush
I'm in the kitchen like a cook
Lean and molly, ecstasy
I don't know what I done took
Turn up with puff or fuck with Goose
The Panamera or my coupe
Future plug like everywhere
I swear, I'm geeked up on the soft
