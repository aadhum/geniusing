dubs
Party real hard
458 Italia
But ain’t nothing Italian about me
The last nigga you had he spared ya
Ain’t nothing can prepare ya, and I ain’t even trying to scare ya
When you walk around the 6 be careful
your hair from you
Tell your mother say a prayer
send me thirty P’s
Kick you with your own feet
kill you with your own cheese
