I love when my bitch get drunk cause she talk greasy to me
Nigga with an attitude, this shit gettin' easy to me
The last time I drunk some lean I was out of my mind
Tried to give me 20 years and that's a whole lotta time
A married woman divorce her husband to spend the weekend with me
He think it nasty when she squirt but that shit sexy to me
The last time I took some molly, took a gram and a half
Niggas think they know 'bout Gucci but they don't know the half
See I'm an ex-X popper and online shopper
Niggas thought I was a clone, they heard me speak proper
Convicted felon worth ten million, I'm a well-known robber
Like Shawty Lo I got ten children, yeah, Lo my partner
Wop
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (hah)
'Cause last time I took pills I had to smash a bitch (geek)
And last time I smoked gas I almost crashed a whip (skrt)
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (half)
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (hah wow)
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it
Last time we took drugs you just took half of it (it's lit)
Stretchin' out my jeans just to make cash fit in (yeah)
Raw dog all my birds, Iâ€™m tryna have some chicks
Zone 6 to the Mo
La Flame linked with La Flare, yeah, that's heat and snow
I want ice cream on your face
Goin' Pharrell Williams on the case (oh my God)
Ohhhh, then we skate-skate-skate away
720 with the grind, landed, landed all fine
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it
Cause last time I took pills I had to smash a bitch
And last time I smoked gas I almost crashed a whip
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (hah)
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (hah)
The last time I went to Onyx man I ordered a dub
Tried to leave with every big booty bitch in the club
I bought a Rolls Royce and a Lambi' when I went to Miami
Last time I went to Vegas, spent 200k gamblin'
They call me Gucci Mane Picasso cause I painted they face
Guwop
Last time I took drugs I just took half of it (hah)
