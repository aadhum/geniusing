Birdie, it's a birdie
It's a birdie, it's a birdie
That's a birdie, there the birdies
I got them birdies, there the birdies
In the goonies making plays, count a birdie
Extendo hold a 30, it’s on me while I’m working
Robin Jeans hold Moneefer
Got OG gas, wanna get served?
I'm from the A, bitch, you know I got wizzerk
Matter fact, let me see y'all skizzir
Got birds of the minolly
Be cool you’ll get Zanotti
