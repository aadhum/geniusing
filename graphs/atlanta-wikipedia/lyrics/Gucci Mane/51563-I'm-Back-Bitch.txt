Im starting off my day wit a blunt of purp,
no pancakes just a cup of syrup
Bakin soda pot and a silver fork

Im back off in the kitchen working wit a chicken

My baby need some shoes my auntie need a purse
Summer comin real soon so I need vurp
I hop up out dat van wit dat duffle bag
couple junkies knockin hard on my front porch
if I dont kno ya I'mma serve you through my b
Dat county jail shit
