Gucci
Meek Milly
From ATL to Philly
Nigga, real recognize real
Yeah, we hood rich bitch
Trap God, turn us up
I'm a money getting nigga
At least, that's just what I'm known for
I heard y'all niggas ballin'
Then why the fuck you take a loan for?
Bricksquad my nig, we rock our own gear (Squad)
They call me Baking Soda Armstrong
Before it dry, that shit be gone
Rose gold on my bottom six
Half a mil on foreign whips
I'm in the wheel with a foreign bitch
I'm on the bra strap, and she on this dick
Just bow down, you lame
Your diamonds look strange
I'm grinding like Wayne
When he on that skateboard, I'm safe
Nigga your new girl's my old bitch
My old bitch your new girl
Ridin' with with a ho named Keisha
And we smoking on Keisha
Young nigga fresh like Easter
That Molly look like a Tic Tac
You on my dick like you a bitch, nigga
Why don't you go and quote yo' own bars?
And I don't want to go back to jail, nigga
But you gon' make me catch one more charge
Your friends keep asking "What's the smell, nigga?"
That's your motherfucking homeboys
