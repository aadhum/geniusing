30 inches on the truck, nigga, no (?)
I'm just a East Atlanta nigga, spend this East Atlanta game
I wear so many diamond necklaces, her head turn like the exorcist
Just came back from Texas, I just re-upped with the Mexicans
Ran off on the plug, all while I delete all his messages
Bells of Kush and bells of purp, man two different addresses
This white shit that I'm sellin' will make you go turn on your relatives
Fuck your block, come shop with me, you know I got them better deals
Kush so strong, gotta smoke it in the restroom
Niggas say they got that gas, well Gucci got that jet fuel
All I rock is 'Sace, 600 for a T-Shirt
Froze!
