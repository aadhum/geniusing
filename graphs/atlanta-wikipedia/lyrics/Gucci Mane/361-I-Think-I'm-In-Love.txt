Canary diamonds on my fist
On my wrists and on my neck
Ms. lady say she know my name
And I ain't even told her yet
No need to introduce myself
I let my money do the greeting
So conceited that if she ain't worth talking to then I'm not speaking
I'm so single, ay let's mingle
Can I buy you some champagne?
And my sex game gladiator
Tell me, are you entertained?
I'm an entertainer, baby, but my name ain't Cedric
I got cheddar and etcetera, so stop the rhetoric
But enough about me, baby
Sweetie, tell 'bout yourself
Are you married or divorced?
Don't gotta tell me, that's your choice
I like your swagg
So let nature take its course
Maybe in the future, gorgeous, I can buy your ass a Porsche
(Gucci!)
Don't be shy, you and I
Me and you can be as one
I can't lie, won't deny
Every time with you is fun
In Dubai, London, Paris, baby, we can watch the sun
Set and rise or just lay back on the beach and watch the sky
She's been sent to me, lent to me
I feel she is God's gift to me
It's Gucci Mane on the mic
While Zay control the symphony
No twisting it, she switching it
But she not all promiscuous
It's obvious she's marvelous
And wants to be a part of this
I give her 1,000%, but this that 50/50 shit
I'm wealthy and I'm healthy
So cut off that boy you kicking with
Give her 1,000% but this that 50/50 shit
I'm wealthy and I'm healthy
So cut off that lame you kick it with
Dinner date, please don't be late
I'm fiending and don't want to wait
Sex so hot and passionate
It'll make her hyperventilate
Yeah, I'm a bachelor
But I'm working my masters
And no, I'm not a doctor
But my money go way past one
I'm checking out her assets
Her ex-boyfriend is past tense
Text her then she text me
More butts than 4 ashtrays
Cause damn I like her accent
