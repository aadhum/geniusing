I'm ridin' high down 85, we call it I-Ocho Cinco
Robin Jean, Tru's and Ballys
On my way to Bora Bora
She can explore like Dora Dora
I'm upper echelon watching Kobe take on Lebron
I'm cooler than the Fonz
So don't chase waterfalls stick to rivers that's in ya city
And R.I.P. to Left Eye but Gucci necklace is chilly, Gucci!
My body's like a novel so read it when I take my shirt off
