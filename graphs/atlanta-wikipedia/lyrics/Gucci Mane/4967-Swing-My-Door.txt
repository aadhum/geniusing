Definition of the south
Ain't no quarters, ain't no halves
Just some wholes in dis house
Ain't no bitch
It ain't no bed
It ain't no clothes in dis house
It's a drought
And my price will make yo eyes pop out
I can't neva count my stash
Cause I always loose count
I can't neva keep no bitch
Cause I put them hoes out
I was corner store and in the motel in it selling it
You can check my rap sheet
It's numerous felonies
I took 23 stacks
And bought some jet skis
Use to have a 10 speed
Now I got a Bentley
I count 18 5 every time swing my door
But they gon search you up and down every time they swing my door
And it's 18 5 everytime they swing my door
I got my rims finger-fucked
By a god dam J
Gave him 1.8
Of some hard ass yay
It's a lot of crack smokers in the apartments where I stay
And I know they name and face
Cause I serve them everyday
Had a 98' Caprice
Was a rollin' drug store
You ain't got all them money
What you call my phone fo'
Rob me, six feet
In the dirt you bout to go
Layin with tha coroner
With a tag placed on your toe
I can lock the whole town
If I break tha shit down
But I'm lettin shit go
And I'm sellin shit whole
Niggas call me thrift store
Cause the know the price low
Spent 350 on the sneakers
It came from servin' geek
Yella yellow 'Vette nicknamed Jakita
Quarter million dollar leavin'
Change my whole demeanor
Lookin' for a trina bitch
Diamond necklace, diamond anklet
Diamond princess Beamer bitch
Ridin' in my rental
Got a Rover in my pocket, though
84 stack, 'bout to take a trip to Mexico
Nigga violate, I'ma kill him and slit his throat
Smoke a blunt of dro, then take my ho to Pappadeaux's
Swing my door
Swing my door
Every time they swing my door
I count 18 5 every time swing my door
Swing my door
Swing my door
Yea them prices real low
They gon search you up and down every time thy swing my door
