It's your boy Yo Gotti,
gyeah
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for 50 more bricks
Bricks!
They think I'm putting VVS jewels in the coke
Drought season in, charged your ass a whole 30
The fish scale white: same color my Hummer
Zone-6 polar bears never see Summer
It's Winter all year cause the birds fly under
95 Air Max cause I'm a dope runner
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for 50 more bricks
Bricks!
I'm on Cleveland Ave...you know my side of town
Light-tan bricks
Just hit a lick for 50 more bricks
Bricks!
I got that Slim Shady, we call it "8 Mile"
