Made a promise to my self that I'll be never broke
Counting up all this money but I'm never tired
Three in the morning and I'm still going
Jewelry so cold feel like the wind blowing
Walk-in closet filled with belts and glasses (Gucci!)
I got that gas pack homie you a schwag seller
She can't even feel her face cause of the powder
One spot three kitchens is a blow spot
