Can’t turn me down, Can’t turn me down
I never let a bad bitch turn me down
Ain’t been out a month already on my sixth pound
I hit the lot with stupid knots and double down
I'm double cupping look at me now
I made a promise to myself that I’mma die rich (Astronaut)
Cause I’m in Pluto, I’m double cupping’ on Dro
I’m plugged in with Migo, I can get a taco
I fuck her til the neighbors tell me turn it down
They won’t talk enough money so I turned it down
