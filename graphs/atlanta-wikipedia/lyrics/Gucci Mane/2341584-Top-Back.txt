[Hook 2x]
Got my feet kicked up and my top kicked back
Smoking thrax in the back with your girl, what you say about that
If you ever run up, get your wig pushed back
In the club on the trap, it’s a fact, what you say about that
Moved so many pounds, they think that I’m a bodybuilder
Bet a hundred chickens I don’t get no recognition
But fuck some recognition, I just want them hundred chickens
Slapped the top of my new [?] like I’m an Indian
Don’t pay up, won’t wake up, and leave you sleeping with the fishes
It’s a well known fact that I keep big straps
Got them things in my bookbag and I’ma bust back
Got a Ziploc full of mollies, I call it the party pack
