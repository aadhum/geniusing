I'm charging 16 fever, 16 fever, nigga my price cheaper, 16 fever
16 fever coca-ina
X pills, bubble kush, mid-grade reefer
Hoes ride dicks, dog, but I ride Beemers
A square rectangle cost 16 fever
16 5-0, there go 5-0
I'm up 2-5 but I need 4 more
I got uncles blowing bundles,
Off-white yayo,
digital scale
Fishscale sending my pigeons by mail
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Gucci got good dope, pills, purp and sizzurp
My workers don't move nothing less than a bizzurd
Bricks: can't keep em
16 fever, Beemer-speakers, geek-a-meters
Misdemeanors, several subpeonas
The squad been teamed up, we cutting off fingers
It's 16 fever and that's since april
My Corvette paid for, my old-school paid for
The hummer roll up? That means you assed out
And you didn't cash out, see this my traphouse
I'm scraping the bowl up, I'm whipping up cake mix
But this ain't red velvet! Don't eat it, you smoke it
3 dollar sacks so you know you can score it
