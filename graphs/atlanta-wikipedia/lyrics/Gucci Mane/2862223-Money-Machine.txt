Florescent lamps in my crib, providing life for my seeds
Claim I'm laundering money but where the washing machines
Sip so much Codeine and Sprite I need a soda machine
And it's placed parallel to the Carbon 15
With the scope, monkey nuts, and the infrared beam
Screaming please don't look at the puppet like American Me
When I say boss I mean that, ya heard me?
I'm so fuck what I sold, my toilet seats solid gold
You should see my new palace cause that bitch bigger than Lowe's
I'm a 8 figure nigga
Since Gucci came home
I call the yayo caucasian
