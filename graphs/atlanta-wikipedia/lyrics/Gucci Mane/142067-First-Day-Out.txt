I'm starting off my day with a blunt of purp
No pancakes just a cup of syrup
Baking soda, pot, and a silver spork
You already know it's time to go to work
I'm back up in the kitchen working with a chicken
midgy
Summer coming real soon so I need a vert
I hop up out that van with that duffle bag
And if a nigga try me I'ma bust his ass
I'm counting up money in the living room
Birds everywhere I call it the chicken room
Alley full of good basement full of Benjamins
If I don't know ya I'm a serve you through my burglar bars
This that new shit, that county jail shit
That seventh floor Rice Street straight out a cell shit
You on my shit list, I'm on the Forbes list
Since I'm a rich nigga, I need a rich bitch
I gotta sick wrist it cost bout six bricks
I'm on that slick shit, that zone 6 shit
