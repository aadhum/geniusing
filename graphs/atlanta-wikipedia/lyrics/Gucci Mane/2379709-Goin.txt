When I went to Lennox
20 grand in every pocket
That's like 80 wit me
Spent so much on champagne, spilled champagne on mysel
Three thousand a room, I'm one hell of a man
He can't beat it up, well I bet you I can
It's so hard for me to dance with this pistol in my pants
I got bricks all in my truck
Audemars on my left wrist
You should see the diamonds dance
You should see these bitches throw it
Twistin' they ass up how they stand
Sellin' white all night that's all I do
Money stacks as tall as you
Fuckin' broads like ballers do
You broke and thats whats wrong with you
I got a Bentley in my pocket, hard to keep my britches up
I'm a trapper and a rapper I don't get no recognition
Cause I juggle two jobs
Flip verses and chickens
