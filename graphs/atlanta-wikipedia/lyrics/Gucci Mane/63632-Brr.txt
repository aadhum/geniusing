What a  cold watch, make your wife say burrr
.38 revolver in the club, try Brick Squad and this shit get ugly
I run around with lunatics
They be on some shootin' shit
Since I got some soldiers I'm on some might as well use 'em shit
(Burrr) Left his body cold, you know how the story goes
Nigga disrespect the king, left him full of bullet holes
Shorty cold with it, work the pole with it
Magic City money, touch her toes with it
(Burrr) Half a million ones
(Ones) That's a lotta paper
(Burrr) Couple hundred guns
Ready for the haters
Burrr
