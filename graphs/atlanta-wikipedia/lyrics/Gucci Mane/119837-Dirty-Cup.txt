6's on the Charger and they said it couldn't fit
But I'mma still do it cause a nigga so hood
Got a super thick chick with some real big lips
take a Twitpic
? of a
big dick
Talkin' too slick, too quick, to a new bitch
Bitch'll teach a trick to a trick, have a blue dick
'Bout the same time that Jay dropped the Blueprint
Nigga tried to say that I hit him with a pool stick
Say you got a gun, but you know you can't use it
So Icey boys, and we still tote Uzis
It's about money, it ain't never 'bout music
Yeah, he from the streets, but he still ain't Gucci
Hunnid bottles of champagne, just cooln
If groupies keep droolin', then the hoes keep choosin'
Damn Gucci Mane, you so unruly
If I'm standing in ya way, then pussy nigga, come move me
10-17, yeah that's my movement
My cup so dirty
My cup so muddy
Dirty cup, dirty cup
Damn I got a muddy cup
Opposite of being broke, mane
Cocaine, dope man, got them Js smokin' out a coke can
Nigga got so much work, talkin' work
When I'm in the car, they still say I'm ridin' in the work van
Oh man, oh man, you don't really know
What it did when the spot you workin' at is really hot
And you gotta put it in the butt, but her butt ain't big enough
So you gotta go get a booty shot
Got my tooly cocked, let the 50 cal dig her down
Niggas know I pay a few bills
You work out, might hit him for a six pack
Work out
Get that? Might hit him for a six pack
Flip that,
me and broke nigga mismatch
My rims cost 10 stacks
Pimp that, pimp what
She said where your motherfuckin' limp at
I said I had a good year baby
So where my, my motherfuckin' blimp at
I don't fuck with y'all, y'all won't ever be me
Be all you can be, don't be like me, mane
Have a pint, have a liter, this that dirty sweet tea
By three, I was just tryin' to grind on a G, mane
Same time that Dr. Dre said "G Thang"
Damn I act a fool in the kitchen with my wrist game
Ice on my neck, got a chick and a Vette
And I'm ballin' like a player for the motherfuckin' Jets
Live at the gun range like my name Chief Keef
I'll knock a passenger to the damn backseat
Gucci Mane street, I'm so concrete
Me and Zay's style is so unique
Got your baby brother sellin' work for me
