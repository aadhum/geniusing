Woke up this morning, bussed down a swisher
Looked in the mirror, like I'm one rich ass nigga'
Brush my teeth with 100's, wipe my ass with these 50's
I'm so motherfucking neighborhood, let's get that understood
I'm not crossing over, this ain't b-ball
Got partners behind the g-wall, 30 for a murder, dog
I pull up in a 2 door
Same color as some puddin'
Goddamn them rims good lookin'
I know you fuck nigga's don't like us but we don't give a fuck
Copy-Catters Bite Us, they swag suck
I put the AK in your face, and I make you like me
If I did this and I didn't do that, Why'd I do that, Why'd I do that
Call me stacks, because I got them racks
Got them green bags, duffel bags, can't hold cash
Don't like me because I'm fucking Icy
