Me, I got my own back
I'm the CEO, CFO, account manager, and security
Who the only one you trust? (me)
CEO, so who I'm signed to? (me)
When I got beef, man, who I run to? (me)
She live with you, but why she riding with (me)?
Bags of kush, who my weed man? (me)
PTs, BTs, man, who my lean man? (me)
Yellow diamonds, dripping, pissing,
In the kitchen whipping, doing the dishes, I'm my own assistance
I hit a lick so low cuffed on myself
then I took me to Lenox
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
Mimi, Mimi, me, yeah the bitch name Mimi, me
Fucking and sucking me, but I know the bitch running game on me
her credit card on E, car on E
So, yeah, she put her mouth on me
Like I'm trapping for you but I'm trapping for me
Wasn't for you and she wasn't for me
Don't leave it to beaver, man, leave it to me
Looking at me and I'm jam of the week
Baby Latino, she fine in some jeans
Gucci bilingual, I'm talking to ti
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
I got lean by the PT, but I'm serving me
MTV, that's Me TV
HOV, but I'm ridin' just me
One deep chilling in this damn RV
You screaming, "Why did it happen to me?"
Them hustlers ain't welcome? I'm happy to leave
Your uncle and brother be coping for me
10 bales of the weed in they family trees
Don't got jumper but putting up the numbers
Don't need a road manager
Me, me, I only think of me
Hoes say that I'm conceited cause it ain't a "we"
I book the club and do the show, chop up the bag with me
I cop the dope, then front the dope, then me come shop with me
On the TV watching me, in a Bentley listening to me
I'm my own stylist, I'm dressing me; I'm my own goon, I'm shooting for me
I'm so turnt I'm jocking me, you hating on me and I'm hating on me
Watching you watching me, and she cheating on you and she cheating on me
Me, me
CEO, so who I'm signed to? (me)
So much jewelry, I got a million on (me)
