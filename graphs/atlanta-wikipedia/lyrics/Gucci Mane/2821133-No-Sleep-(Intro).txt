I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(pint a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day
When the sun comes out it takes the rain away
But just like Noah it been rainin' the last 40 days
Sold my first 8-ball and bought me my first pair of J's
They knockin' on the door, know I'm just in the 7th grade
I'm mixin' codeine pills and molly in a lemonade
I feel like briscuit so damn high, might just die any day
For all you junkies that's addicted, please don't get offended
I'm a recovering drug addict and that's not my intention
Spend like half a chicken
worth half a ticket
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to drink a pint a day
(pint a day)
I can't even sleep I got so much to say
Recovering drug addict, I used to smoke a pound a day
Fuck the feds, fuck the police, fuck the DEA (DEA)
I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep, I can't even sleep
