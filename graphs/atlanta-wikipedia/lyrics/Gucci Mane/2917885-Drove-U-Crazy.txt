And your car too slow, you need to drive Miss Daisy
Jumped out the feds like "Fuck You, pay me"
Got her foaming mouth like the bitch got rabies
Got me running out the spot like the spot got raided
Never met a plug like this
Never pour Ace of Spades in the tub like this
Aye lil' mama say she fuck with me tough yeah
Aye lil' mama say she fuck with me tough yeah
Her ex-boyfriend's words cut deep
Aye, Young Tiller in the cut, yeah
But y'all already know where I'm from, yeah
Straight from the 502 hey
Now they wanna show my moves, hey
Every little thing that I do and say
