What's happening?
You know I got a car for every day of the week, don't you
I want to fuck you every Wednesday
I'm getting like 50 every Wednesday
I make a Friday out of Wednesday
I drive my Benz when it be Wednesday
I want to fuck you every Wednesday
I'm really in town on a Wednesday
100 bands, I made it Wednesday baby
Who give a fuck about what your friend say baby
I'm a middle of the week freak
I cannot fuck her on a weekend
We chillin', listening to The Weekend
That's when that freaky shit gone begin
