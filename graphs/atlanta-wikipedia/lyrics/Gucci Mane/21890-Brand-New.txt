Brand new, Gucci Mane actin' brand new (huh)
Fuck you, yeah bitch I'm actin' brand new (Gucci)
Everything new, hat to the socks
Feeling brand new like they pulled me out the box
Crazy color white and blues blinging off my watch
Its a Frank Mueller boo, and it cost a 100 rocks
Feeling brand new, cowabunga dude

Disrespect my crew, you might end up on the news
Say my head gettin big, and my chest poked out

Brand new everything, jeans, shirt, locs too(Gucci)

Im smoking on that fruit while I'm getting interviewed (Gucci)
