I’m my best friend
And I’m my worst enemy
And no one else can hurt me unless I let them
Is you feeling me
And misery loves company and I had my share of misery
No mystery, my infamy got me in hip hop history
First 2Pac died then Biggie died
And that greatly impacted me
Then history repeated itself through me and I make history
A hard head makes a soft ass
Guess your Ma didn't teach ya that
Pick a spot to beef with me and that spot I will meet you at
Well let me check my schedule
I’m free Tuesday 3 weeks from now
You bring your crew I bring my crew
Just pick a time and side of town
Zone 6 is my stomping ground
But I guess you know that by now
Bought a Phantom and a Lamb' but I’m in my 'Vette right now
I raped the game without a rubber, bank accounts are pregnant now
That day they tried to murder me a day I can’t forget about
And I don't wish no death on homie
Just want him to hear me out
Think about the past and all the many things we talked about
Think about all the people influenced by what comes out our mouth
I dissed Tiny she didn’t deserve it
Just diss me till you satisfied
I swear it doesn’t bother me
Sticks and stones will break my bones and bullets won't reflect off me
But words and insults only show the world how ya’ll respectin' me
I'm still hungry as I was when I did my first live performance
M J G said it best man will I ever know
Who my friends through thick and thin, cause so called friends will turn to foes
