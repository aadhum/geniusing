They ain’t got nothing on you
I swear them hoes, they ain’t got nothing on you
That nigga broke, he ain’t got nothing for you
I fuck with you cause you’re very loyal
And you’re so fine, you make my blood boil
She took the charge, they ain’t got nothing on her
We might just pull up in twin Californias
She think I’m with another woman
Another woman that gonn keep me comin
It’s nothing,
Claim they are, but you bluffin
Come home and I hit it hard, and she gives me head that’s concussion
I’m stunting,
OG Kush what I’m puffin
Just bought my wife a pair of glass shoes
Cause her ass thick as a pumpkin
They ain’t got nothing on her
She don’t want no other nigga, she fuckin with a stoner
I fuck with shawty cause she very loyal
We can tie the knot like Memph and Toya
Let's have two girls and call them Rolls and Porsche
You your Daddy's lil girl, but you’s a grown lady
And I don’t see you like he see you cause we not related
After the third shot of patron, I swear can’t even taste it
