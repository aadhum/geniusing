1 for the money
3 for my luggage game (Dram' cruise!)
Crazy luggage game Gucci
(Mr. Thanksgiving!)
Well damn Gucci!
coca leaves like Sosa
I shoot you just like Tony
When homey knocked his sister down
Scarface Gucci: my life’s a motion picture
Gucci Tarantino, Casino, Gucci Pacino
I’m Gucci Mane Soprano
more keys than a grand piano
Watching Blow, thinking George'll look out for Diego
I’m smoking on that color purple, working like I’m Harpo
Feeling just like Smokey felt when Craig beat shit out Debo
Call me Gucci Watch Me
freeze me, save me, watch me: TiVo
Boyz In The Hood, got juice and rock jewelry
Cars "Fast And Furious", shout out to my boy Ludacris
Supafly
High School Higher Than an Eagle eye
I think that they should legalize, my flow stronger than turpentine
Trafficking like Bailey, bricks coming across the border line
Gucci Mane not Stephen King but my car crazy like Christine
Rolls - Mary's baby
born young and broke in 1980
Black and broke I’m thugging crazy, made it hard for mom to raise me
Set it off, Dead Presidents, hop out the trash can painted faces
Eddie Murphy: Trading Places
Sanford Son, Gucci Mane
But you can call me Shady Grady
Gangsta Grillz
Gucci Mane will be your Daddy
I live in a TV, I live in a TV
Don’t you think I’m handsome? There’s no need to answer
Hoes think it’s cute but my money got my pants sagging
Tell your boy the truth: that his daddy is a faggot
Only reason that you had him was for your fucking taxes
