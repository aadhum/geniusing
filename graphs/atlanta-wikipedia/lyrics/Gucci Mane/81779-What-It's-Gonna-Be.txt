I'm in the zone, they keep on getting offended
And now I'm making millions, everybodys' social
"I wanna be a billionaire," Me too
So I can count a billion cash in hundreds on Youtube
I get dirty money bitches bitches know it's ciroc on my rider
I'm on stage with Diddy, Nicki, Rozay and Flo-Rida
ball like Stoudemire, Amare
Hold the blunt with my left hand to show my Audemars in Paris
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got your dime on my line asking
What it gon' be?
New Mercedes with 80 in it, watch me spend all 80 in 80 minutes
Bought a car so sharp it make the feds suspicious
Le Mans edition
Dare anybody here to put they hands on me
Too many stacks on me, so many racks on me, got a dime on my line asking
What it gon' be? What you gon' do Gucci, when you gon' leave?
Still popping bottles pouring liquor on chicks; no need to lie I'm such a freak
From Zone 6 down to Camilton, I pull up in that yellow thing
lead,
Spent 2 G's a week on haircuts, like 4, 5, 6, 7 times a week
I'm in a new GT with the Georgia peach
My jewelry was so bright haters put theirs in the trash
Pulled up in something fast just to make them haters mad
Rims with the paper tag, paper bag full of cash
