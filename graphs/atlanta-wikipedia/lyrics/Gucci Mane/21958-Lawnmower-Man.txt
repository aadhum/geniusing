Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash
I'm the lawnmower man and your ass is grass
Gucci Mane make a nigga wear a shit bag
acting bad
Like a kid at Six Flags
hit a lick for about fifty stacks
I'm getting fat, fuck a jumping jack
Body Tap
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash
'caine
I swear
I'd never tuck my chain in
you're just a thug in training
I'm a thug entertaining
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash
Yours truly, Young Gucci, all I do is hustle hard, never had credit
But used my tool as a Mastercard, grimy and gritty
Don't let your mouth write a check that your ass can't cash
