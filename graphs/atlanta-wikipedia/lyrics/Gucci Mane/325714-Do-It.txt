They know that Gucci Mane stay fresh and he didn't have to do it

(Verse)
Don't need no stylist, I'm so fresh, I didn't even have to do it
And get how many, can even a man take car paint that's on a Buick
little lick that he got,
lipsy
Took my car service to Slawson, bought 10 Patriot from the 60's
Why you pass that blunt to me? Baby you know that shit too skinny
