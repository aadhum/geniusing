You came to Atlanta but didn't ask my permission
You walked in normal but ya walked out with stitches
I'm Mister Nighttime I lose my mind with the bottles
At Ocean Prime at lunchtime eatin' steak with a model
Tried to make it to the Ham, got pulled over Villa Rica
Sell bales, and bricks, and blunts, and loosies
