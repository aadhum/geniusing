Livin' Legend
I'm a legend
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
I'm rollin' and I'm gone off ecstasy
My daddy was a hustler apple don't fall far from the tree
And I'm Gucci
(Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum)
Got that gun with me
Got two hundred round drums in the car with me
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Like MJ in Thriller man I dance with monsters
Sometimes I know that it's a snitch amongst us
I got straps like Super Contra
Chain so sick probably got breast cancer
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
Bu-Bum Bu-Bum Bum
