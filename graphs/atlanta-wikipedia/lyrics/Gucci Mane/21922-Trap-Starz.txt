Gucci Gucci, Zaytoven
24's on yo' car youse a trap star
If you known to buy the bar youse a trap star
You got a watch on your wrist youse a trap star
You got ice around yo' neck youse a trap star
So much dope that my scale just coated in, snow
Man I'm ridin through the hood in a CL-6
I'm the nigga that your baby daddy re-up with
Celebrities, athletes you might see me with
I got a thousand blue pills, I ain't talkin 'bout aspirins
Uhh, got a whole bunch of trees
And the kind we move don't got no seeds
