I’m in the ATL & I’m hot as hell with no AC
Got more green than AC,
I spend 1-50 on my AP
An Aquarius, no Aries
Got a 1000 P’s of Asparagus
And it’s just touched from AZ
You fuck niggas don’t know me
Be accurate when you compare me
Got a AR & a AK & I’ll turn yo' ass to swiss cheese
Watching out for APD
Cause the spot been hot all goddamn week
Flashback, quantum leap
2003 and I’m in my V
Go back '99, puttin' Daytons on my Caprice
My pistol’s my assistant
I’ll shoot yo' ass from a distance
Greasy, greasy
Don’t bring no knife to no gun fight because they greasy
Don’t buy no dope in East Atlanta cause that greasy
These niggas thirsty for that check, I swear they greasy
Young niggas greasy, OGs they greasy
West side, east side, north side, south side I swear they greasy
These niggas greasy, these bitches greasy
Young niggas thirsty for the check, I swear they greasy
Gucci Mane rock so much jewelry
And ask the Wizard can you get some courage
Buy a brick and it don’t do shit
Don’t quit nigga, don’t get discouraged
Actin' like you bougie
What you're Hillary Rodham bitch?
With them ol' last red bottoms
She blew a kiss, I didn’t acknowledge it
Think I need me a college chick
Good brain
with that knowledge shit
Put her up on money
Switch out the bitch closet quick
Charger with a body kit
