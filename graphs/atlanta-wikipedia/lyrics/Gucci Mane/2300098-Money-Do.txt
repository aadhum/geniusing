I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
Like Dikembe Mutombo, get a lot of them big blocks
Emmitt Smith on the back tire
But the front tire's a Deion
Get this shit for the 17
Sell shit for the Keyshawn
I don't have an ego, but my money do, my money do
And I don't have a big mouth, but my money do, my money do
And I don't like to show out, but my money do, my money do
I got so many zeroes I could bury you its Gucci
Passin' Ace of Spades like it's bottled water to the crew
Brick Squad, nigga!
I got so many zeroes I could bury you, its Gucci
