Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
Snaggle-tooth
Iâ€™m a tycoon, I can change her longitude and latitude
Slap niggas with pistols til' they only can eat baby food
Colder than a refrigerator, hotter than a stolen coupe
Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
They be stupid, dumb, bad with that crazy Gucci bag
set
You can love me all you want but i'ma lock you from a distance
Egging
Fresher than my pad,
baby girl you got me twisted
I had a girl named Susie and she used to go the distance
gift
Just like the Sprite and Promethazine, bitch you got me mixed up
Word on the street, I'm the best thing going
Smoking on the gas, got the best thing blowing
Tattoo's on my face, It's my face not yours
Yellow horses on my cars, like they rocking Ralph Lauren
Bought an old school yesterday just to paint the bitch orange
