We've evolved from small to tall
And shall not stall, been flying too long
It tastes like lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
That flavor is lemonade
Scrunch your face when you see me paid
I'm not listening, I'm not interested
Diamondâ€™s glistening, they call me Mr. Check
Uh, yo,
this one goes out to all of my critics
Don't you feel stupid? Look how I did it!
Look how it came to pass when I said it
We can do debit, cuz I don't need credit
Yes, I'm epic, look how I rep it
It's been eight years
but I broke the record
Yup, the record... yup, the record... yup, the record
(Just for the record)
And I'll admit, I'm appalled when you envy
Cuz you can do it, too, and you can do it, too
I just happen to be the girl that they threw it to
So I'mma bounce back, and I'mma ball out
And every time that you see me I go all out
And I'mma win till the ending
Don't be mad when you see me transcendin'.
Gucc!
I ball hard, I should be in Sports Illustrated
Feds investigation on what I accumulated, insinuated
That I'm not the man that I say I am
Like I I give a damn
