Well, it take money to make money
That's why I make money
Need some today so
I'mma go take they money
Flip money, I weigh money
Hundred grand, that's play money
Lob city, that's Blake money
Cash money, that's Drake money
Broke niggas, they hate money
Rappers they get slave money
Rich niggas we waste money!
Still making that slow money
Ha, cause you owe money
Like Big Meech, I blow money
It take money to make money
Anytime you ready x3
Wanna race nigga, wanna gamble?
Anytime you ready x3
Like shopping, like travel?
Anytime you ready x3
I could hit the club and go crazy
Anytime you ready x3
Financial goals I met it
It's a drummer track an it's epic
