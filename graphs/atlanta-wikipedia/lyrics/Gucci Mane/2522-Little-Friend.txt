We need more Ros√©
My bitches gettin' thirsty
My left pinky finger rollin' like George Gervin
My name ain't Ervin but call me Magic
Abra cadabra, top off the Phathom
458 Italia, first in the states
Out of town plates, just to make it look great
I need a haircut plus a carwash
I get out the car and they take their bra's off
See I fought the law and the fuckin' law won
Income income, go and get you sum
Say bye to the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy
Gucci Mane the bad guy
Yes, I am the Bad guy
Wave bye to the Bad guy
I came to this country with a dollar and a dream
Say hello to my little friend
I go to court so much I could've been my own employer
I got sixty racks layin' on the floor in Magic City
Like Samuel L Jackson I think it's time for killin'
I touched his wife titty and the nigga start trippin'
That ain't proper etiquette you see the bitch strippin'
AR-15 ripped his ass into pieces
Don't get it twisted think it's all about the pieces
And all about the bracelets
I'm still fighting cases
Ten thousand for the glasses
Diamonds in they faces
Your own blood taste it
We stomp you till you tasteless
My t-shirt ain't tailored
Brick squad bossman
Move to America
Dollar and a dream and a donor picture, tear it up
