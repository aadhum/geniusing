You can run but you can't hide cause I can see you, boy
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
Drop the top, no ceilin', boy, man, get out your feelings, boy
You can run but you can't hide cause I can see you, boy
Gucci Mane the trap God and I had you paranoid
doggy dogg world
How the fuck you Muslim with a Jesus piece?
Murk your lil homie, wipe his house with bleach
