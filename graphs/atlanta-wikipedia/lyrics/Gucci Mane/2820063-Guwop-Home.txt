Mike Willy with me nigga
Big Guwop home
We no longer miss you, yeah
I know Guwop home
We all no longer miss you
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans
In blue flame, yeah the trap god throwing green rain
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich ass nigga, I got everything
Rose gold watch, but my bottle pink gold
Can't stay the night I'm not the type to be on Skype ho
Wrote me off, said that I was gone, that was a typo
Take a black bitch outta Magic make her Nicki
Pissy yellow Rollie
Big titty Amazon in my black Benz
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich ass nigga, I got everything
My teeth white like a toilet tissue
We hit the lobby
I got the syrup, bring the Jolly Ranchers
Pockets full of money, Master P, ay
National Siblings Day
Call the dentist day
Run it up to the top
Get out and ran it back to the top
Money talk like I'm Charlie Sheen, yeah
I'm a blood but I got on blue jeans
Orange seats, orange feet, what do all that orange mean?
Old rich ass nigga, I got everything (It's Gucci)
