A lot of racks in my jeans, about 30 grand
I got the battle of the bands in my fuckin' pants
I'm throwin' Hamiltons and Grants like I'm Kev Durant
In Robin jeans and True Religions, don't like suits, don't wear ties
We wise guys with mob ties, shoot more than A.I
These presidents, they haunt me, they go everywhere I go
Hella, all I fuckin' need is some mothafuckin' racks
And a stripper with a booty that know how to make it clap
Cause I can make it rain, I know how to make it back
Money come, money go, but somehow we stay attached
