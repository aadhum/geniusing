Lord knows I don't wanna be
In the penitentiary
I be right back smoking weed
Chilling with the family
Cause that's my reality
That shit might be a tragedy
Starting out my week with a quarter boat
Stupid strong and I won't sell a quarter O
I got 5 on that
[Verse 1 - Gucci Mane]
I got 5-0 mad cause I'm infamous
Fuck fame, strippers love me ask Infamous
I'm from the 6 but my dick dunn been in movie stars
But we got weight so really wanna sell dope
E A G A
Anything move here, Gucci paper
