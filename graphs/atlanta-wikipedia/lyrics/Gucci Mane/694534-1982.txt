I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
Jes√∫s pull up, I pull up, then we pop trunks and switcharoo
Back to the wall, back to the mall
Wednesday night, I'm back to Kamal's
Run up on me and I'm breaking ya' jaw
Brick Squad Records, you know who we are
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I'm in Sun Valley in a dark alley
Goin' H.A.M like a ham sandwich
Hunnid grand in my pant's, countin' money's romantic
I made somethin' outta nothing, I didn't have nothing to lose
I came up in the struggle, I had holes all in my shoes
