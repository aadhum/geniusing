And you can't bring it back if you done bust a wrapper
My daughter 4 months, bricks in her pamper
I'm a road master, I love Tampa
You say you from the streets, then I gotta stamp ya
The streets will give it to you and the streets will take it
I go loco 'bout that guapo, off El Chapo with the choppa
Like a rasta I will've shot ya
blocka blocka Waka Flocka!
No I'm not an infant but I got a bunch of baby bottles
