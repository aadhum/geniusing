Got a real hot mouth, she a stone cold freak
10 girls in my suite, brought sand to the beach
Got a nigga from the country, call two times a week
And when I skeet I try to aim it at her snow white teeth
Red bottoms on the wood, watchin' the Hawks play the Heat
6 ounces and a liter that's a dirty sweet tea
I'm a zone 6 king
and my jeans got wings
I'm servin' softball, I pitch underhanded
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
My stash done got so big that I can't rubber band it
My cartel speakin' Spanish, I can't understand it
So stop the track my nigga let's get some understandin'
Bitch shut the fuck up and take these 10 bricks to Kansas
Now I can't dance a lick but look my diamonds dancin'
Rap or trap my nigga I'mma take my chances
I had a couple ____ didn't go down how I planned it
I guess I fronted him too much, he couldn't handle it
You disrespect the Squad then you get reprimanded
Blowin' kush in her hair, she smokin' second handed
Two ways, four nines call it Georgia candy
Cookin' dope in Louboutin cuz I'm kinda fancy
Jewish lawyers what we've retained
Bought the _____ of Dorthy
I watch the money like a deadly cobra
And hit my phone once you got the bricks
You hit the road you better hold it if you gotta piss
