I rock da yeezy
I don't got the busses, I got them Blue Russians
Them bales on the conway, they coming, they coming!
DK think he running, he need some money
So many foreign shoes, Im growing bunions
Running so fast, I'm mo faster than sonic
I'm callin' no ballers, I'm callin' no roof
Tell her the truth you got shot in the tooth
No sippin', no drippin' like I wanted to poop
What did you do? What did you do?
Why on the sudden I'm one of the 2?
Half over million I feed on my belly
You run up while you got shot in the kidney
