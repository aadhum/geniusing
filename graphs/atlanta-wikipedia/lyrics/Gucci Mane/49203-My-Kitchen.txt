Another beat banger, Fatboi fucking with me
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen
Thirty thousand dollars for the So Icey Squad
Thousand pound deal for the So Icey Boys
Gucci Aquarius a So Icy shark
Selling white chalk tryna duck these narcs
Bought some Lowenharts and some D.U.B.'s
34 inch Ashanti's on the Humvee
Whole lot of purp, whole lot of green
Whole heap of white, large amount of beans
Got them collard greens, sell a lot of things
Four plus a four, dawg, that's a chicken wing
Trapping in a drought, money in the vault
Bring me another pot and another fork
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen

And I'm so high, it's so lonely up here
Big booty bitches loves a good cooking player
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen
But we ain't really lost cause we can Isotol dat ass
How you cop it, Gucci? Plenty working in the kitchen
Pounds in the trash can, Gucci do the dishes
Don't nobody, nobody fuck with my kitchen
Bought a old school, then I sat it on 6's
How you cop it, how you get it? plenty working in the kitchen
