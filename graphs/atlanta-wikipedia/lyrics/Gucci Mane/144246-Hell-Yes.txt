R.I.P. To Pimp
And O.D.B
Getting head from a smart bitch
I’m pourin' up dark shit
Woke up in a mansion – grew up in apartments
Got a car don’t need no keys, baby
Automatic starter, my finger, baby
Point a finger, start fightin' like Springer
Like Billy Dee, get in my ride
And girl, get out my dreams, baby
Work on your footwork like Hakeem, baby
Smoking on kush got my eyes real lazy
Rolling up half a pound, no shirt ‘cause girls around
All this money on me, girl, I’ll treat you special
Let me be the treasurer, get you a bezel
And you can be my trafficker, send you wherever, baby
Like Pun and Joe, I don’t wanna be a player no more
Zone 6, I can’t be your mayor no more
Brick Squad goin’ broke? Nigga that’s a “hell no”
Baby, I’mma go out my way just to please you
Please don’t leave me now, girl, ‘cause I need you
I’ll cut these hoes off right now, I really need to
And I don’t even know why, girl, but I believe in you
You’ve been stuck on my line since you laid eyes on me
Some niggas might say no to drugs
All my crew say “hell yeah”
We don’t go get one pair, we go get twelve pair
All my niggas got brick fair, all my niggas got brick fair
I was worth ten mill’ when Vick was here
And the same ‘hood you can’t come to
That’s the one, my mama pay rent there
Spin the globe, every point i’ve been there
I went platinum in Australia
Like Pun and Joe, I don’t wanna be a player no more
Zone 6, I can’t be your mayor no more
Brick Squad goin’ broke? Nigga that’s a “hell no”
