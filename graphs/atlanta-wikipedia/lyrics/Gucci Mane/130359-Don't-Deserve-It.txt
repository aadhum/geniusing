It’s the little Rochy right here
I know yall love it when we get together
I’m walkin with my strap, I give a fuck a nigga searchin
Don’t keep it in the car, I got that pistol on person
You pissed Flocka Flame – you dissed the fuckin wrong person
Run up on Gucci Mane – you be another dead person
I toss em in the river – now the whole city searchin
The AK hit his ass and now that nigga need a surgeon
Try me in this club then I’m gon shut it down early
Scene was so sick that the police start hurling
Undisputed Dynamic Duo in the building
Stand up for this shit man
We raised yall niggas
DJ Holiday, Gucci Mane
Trap Back 2 niggas
I give a fuck a nigga searchin
You pissed Flocka Flame – you dissed the fuckin wrong person
I toss em in the river – now the whole city searchin
The AK hit his ass and now that nigga need a surgeon
East Atlanta zone 6 niggas so thirsty
The sharp with your 2’s, damn rob your ass thirsty
You reach for my chain you be another dead person
Then look me in my eyes when you see me cuz you’re nervous
I murk your homeboy and I smoked a pound of purple
Fuck it cuz the young nigga turfin
Oh you a live-wire? Then I’mma make you short-circuit
Million dollar nigga but I still eat Church's
You try me in these Church's then my boy then start burstin
Old school vet like I’m fuckin James Wordis
But I’m shootin from the corner like I’m fuckin Bobby Hurley
My youngin 13 like a 3rd world shooter
In a couple years he’ll be taking over blocks
AK47, got him takin over spots
We fucked the same bitch, the only difference is you paid er
Screamin adios
One minute here, next minute you a ghost
