How you 'gon hold me down you can't even hold water
Smokin' more weed than the nigga Quincy Carter
Cooking up a deuce and it smell so good
Baby how you get all that in them jeans?
Yeah how you get all the cash in them jeans?
I ain't talkin' ass man I'm talkin' 'bout green
AK with a jagged edge on it like Wingo
Got my top let up like a hat on Neyo
