I'm a thuuuuuuuug
Even though I wanna change my life and get it right
To the judge, I'm always gon' be a thuuug
Like O-Dog, "Menace II Society"
Feelin' hipper than a hippie in a tye-dye shirt
He make it rain, then I can make it monsoon
Me and Wyclef and the swagger's SoSoDef
Tired of all these late nights, smoked out shit
Ain't no mo' leavin the club three or fo' bad chicks
I ain't goin to the lot, coppin no mo' whips
I ain't drinkin, all the pills, I'm all done, I quit
