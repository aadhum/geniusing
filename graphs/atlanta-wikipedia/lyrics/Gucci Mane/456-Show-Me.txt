Bend your back, flip your shoulders, drop your head
Bust it open if you love it like you say you love it, baby girl
Gucci Mane La Flare
Potential to be my "Gucci Girl"
Word: in the Louis shop you'll be my Louis girl
We'll be poppin' bottles? Naw! We'll be poppin' cases
Gucci Mane La Flare got lawyers to fight all the cases
Pull up in an '08, looking like a stingray
Then calamarr' in my brand new Ferarr'
Sorry, stepping on your fins with my Maurras
Staring, staring, it's apparent that they staring
Baby girl, cause I'm fresher when I'm glaring
Shorty want to marry me
Say she don't have sex casually
Don't want to be a casuality
Got a faculty, got more Magnums than an infantry
Baby, that's the penalty and trapping is just energy
Gucci Mane La Flare, you can call me "Guccirace"
Million-dollar shine: call me "Gucci Dibiase"
Like Ted Dibiase
put you in a "figure-4"
Got them 4's on the Maserati
O, kimosabe
Got them bitches in the lobby
And they waiting on Guccirace
I got 4's on the Maserati
O, kimosabe
Got them bitches in the lobby
And they waiting on Guccirace
