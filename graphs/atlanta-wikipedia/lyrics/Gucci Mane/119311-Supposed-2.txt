summer
Can’t buy no drink from me, you ain’t got no seal
Can’t drink no pints with you cuz you pour unreal
You pour the lean so light you gotta take 4 pills
I pour the lean so dark they still sleep still
I’m not Boosie not Webbie but I’m too damn trill
Lil Phat
Slim
Shotgun'll make you say Big Sean ad libs
Fifth's
You want stop a duck from quackin' then cut off his bill
And I can’t marry her cuz money married to me
