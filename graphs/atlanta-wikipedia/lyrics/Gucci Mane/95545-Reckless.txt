And Waka Flocka, thanks Flocka Waka
Two times, cause we two crimes
Two bloods and two rides with fo' nines and gang signs
Reckless, reckless, e'rybody goin HAM
Don't test this, cause if you do
That Smith & Wesson go blam, damn
And I don't mean I'm jackin off when I say I'm chokin chickens
I mean, when we rap on mo' we call that chokin chickens
