My pack came in, I want seventeen-five for 'em
Bricks go down when you get more than five on 'em
Bck in '98, I was holdin that 'tel down
2006 and now we're breakin them bales down
Gucci you the shit, least that what they told me
Catch me in the 6 a nigga right where the shoals be
If you don't pay me then it's back to the old me
Coca√≠na same color the snow be
You trap that's cool, I trapped since school
I'm not a role model little shorty rep your turf
I'm not a role model young nigga cook that work
