Gucci Mane I’m fucking nervous
This shit done turned me to another person
My momma told me I was fucking worthless
Cause’ I was servin’ servin’ servin’ servin’
But I can’t flip no motherfuckin’ burgers
I got this strap I’ll motherfuckin’ murder
My nigga scooter that’s my main dog
That nigga Flocka will never fall off
Now Bricksquad is more than just me
I make a million dollars in my damn sleep
I thank the lord for all the game he gave me
A gangster’s life is up and down
One day you up next minute you down
My nigga you gotta stay down, down
You know that brick fare is up and down
One minute its 40 one minute its 20 one minute it’s not around
You know it’s up and down
One minute I’m out one minute I’m in but nigga I gotta stay out
Im stayin down
Nigga don’t wanna see another nigga
With a stack like a five hunda
Me and my nigga got old schools
Old schools and them fuckers running
Pulling up to the racetrack
Ain’t never had no Pro-Keds
Always stayed dead fresh
