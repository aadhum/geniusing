Everyday is Cinemax,
every night's a porno
niggas
animals, Congo
diamond out of Frisco
The year's '49
and I know everything that Bo know
Rocking with the live band
Bad to the bone
leave my hat where my home is
Brick Squad Mafia, dressed in black, your boy is back
And off the wall with bricks and bails and pints of lean and cars and all
Shining like a French cut diamond like an actor
Everyday is Cinemax, every night's a porno
La Flare
I just bought a chicken, And it came with biscuits
Our trap is a drive-thru, call it Mrs. Winters
Chicken finger-licking
Don't tolerate no snitching
Chicken go for 30, chicken go for 30
30-rack shawty, tryna score a birdie
Chicken go for 30
but my chicken purrdy
Niggas with them low numbers
His chicken so dirty
I keep it 100
my trap do them numbers
my pockets on humongous
young Juiceman with that money
If you spend that 30, Your chicken 100
bullets
Streets made me bigger, I'm the nigga behind the trigga
Try to snatch the chain off my CEO neck
Will get you jumped,stabbed,shot, If you want respect
