I'm so motherfuckin' turned up right now
Someone please turn Gucci Mane down
Brick Squad thugged out, we don't give a fuck
you a motherfuckin' scrub
I pulled up in a 4-door Porsche
set-trippin'
dreadhead
But if they move wrong, I'll red up their white beater
I do it for the red, black, yellow, white people
I just bought a K, just the other day
And I don't play with grown men: I don't like to play
Niggas hang on me, I don't give a fuck right now
Well you niggas keep on trying like the little engine that could
You think you can, you think you could,
Call me Gucci Flocka Flame, I dun changed my name
Call me Frenchie Mane La Flare, Gucc' the Kid..it's all the same
I be running, gunning, stunting with 100 killers riding
I just bought another house just to house my goons
So Icey Entertainment
I'll murk your boy in March, they didn't find that boy til June
I wish they found him August so that's like "too much too soon"
His face was swoll and puffy, bout the color of a prune
Brick Squad Movement and, no, you're not apart of it
Me, Waka and Wu, Juice and Frenchie Mane started it
Iced out bar got me ballin' like the Lakers
Homicide around the corner. Where you, in Jamaica?
I'm a Nigga With an Attitude holding on the gun
17 niggas, I left 16 hit
Last nigga hit the corner, got his whole head split
Let your soul meet the sole of the bottom of my Chucks
