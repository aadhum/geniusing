These bitches popping mollies like the hippies in the 60's
I'm talking like I'm Tony Montana
Homes ain't killing no children
In Sun Valley with blue new Ballys and
Bricks all under the building
liding riding without my ceiling
Used to be my ho, you can have that ho
My nigga I ain't got no feelings
Before I started rapping, Gucci Mane was selling dope
Call my phone again, I'mma have to tell 'em 'go'
2 hundred squares, hundred pairs
What's the price - low
summertime them Forgies mounted
Johnny Dang on my wrist
Cost 'bout a couple bricks
Vellanos
Forgiatos
Got the .40 on my hip
With 'bout 50 in the clip
My niggas will leave you slumped
Migos meet me in the front
Bitch this ain't what I want
Try to play me like a punk
My niggas will leave you slumped
summertime them Forgies mounted
Bitch I'm from the Jack City
Allen Temple riding with me
summertime them Forgies mounted
