In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
In the East Atlanta I'm Birdman
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman
Birdman(2x)
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman
I keep a stupid bank roll yeah a big bank roll
And I keep going to the club to see these same hoes
And I can't kick with a nigga that got no twitter nigga
BG nigga all on you
Ain't got money like Birdman but in the East Atlanta i'm Birdman
Spraying every bed
crazy young nigga with the dreads man
And we smoke kush we stay high like Method Man and Redman
And these farmer's growing weed just like tomatoes and eggplants
Disrespect Brick Squad a very bad decision
