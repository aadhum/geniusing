I can't stop, I won't stop, I keep getting money
Not a ball player but got baseball money
Drumma Boy on the track: too much money
Never too much, never too much money!
G4, Gucci Mane traveling cross-country
ice
whips
Britney Spears guts
Offset Asanti's with the Fantasia lips
Hah! I make it rain on Rihanna
Rain so much she had to get an umbrella
Need a Beyonce to drank what I drank
If you freaky like Lil Kim than you think like I think
Tell BET Rocsi need to get mean
My little boy one, but his shoes 400
With tax, better yet, $450
Gucci all red, so he's shittin' on the infants
I'm ballin' like the Mavericks with all this money
40,000 - all hundreds - made it last Saturday
Made it rain on a Hawks player last Monday
Dropped 40 points, sold him like it wasn't nothing
Indiana Pacers, Marquis Daniels
Did a feature with me, gave me 40,000 cash man
Man..man, I feel like Strahan
Just won the Super Bowl, trap going mayhem
Drumma Boy and Gucci Mane, shawty fit'na blow up
I mean shawty fit'na to blow me down
40 goons with me. Why they here? Just to hold me down
