dolly,
My life a real movie
Your girlfriend want to change her heart she is a real groupie
And this is not a water gun this is a real Uzi
I'm like a million dollars richer than a week ago
Got so much jewelry on I look just like a jewelry store
If you a bad bitch why you wearing sneakers for?
I'm smoking swishers not the same shit Wiz Khalifa smoke
I'm rocking' real Prada, I'm rocking real Louie
one stop shop
Steal from me I'm killing all close friends
Clayton county thatâ€™s gangland
If you want the pass him river dell
Can't stand a lame and a broke bitch
Like a GD I'm a boss bitch, hanging out the window with a chopstick
Got leather gloves with no mask, when I hit a lick
Just to let you know who took your shit
