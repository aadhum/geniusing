Gucci, Gucci, huh, huh, huh, ha?
plug
Que pasa amigo?
Cocaine more bonito
Six hundred Wednesday, five thousand Tuesday
El nombre es Gucci, no punta, no pussy
Got me making ten G's an hour, money's power, time is money
plug
All of this ecstasy is killin' me softly
Where is me lighter?
Put up your hands 'fore I put up my rifle
plug
