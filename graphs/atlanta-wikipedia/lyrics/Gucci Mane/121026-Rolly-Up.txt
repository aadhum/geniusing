Since my money fat I’m throwin stacks
Patron shots I’m throwin back
We look good, I’mma spend some racks
Turn round back and a brick squad tat
Taz brought it back but it still don’t pass
Push that Jag with a bag of cash
All this stash, and I hope it lasts
And I’ve never seen the bitch, suck dick so fast
I ain’t even know you was rich like that
How the hell a nigga pull a bitch like that?
How the hell a nigga got a watch like that?
How a nigga face to face with some shit like that?
You better keep your pistol with your Rolex
You want a yacht, master know your mathematics
Chugga then your motherfucker, screaming Rolex game
kill yourself – Kurt Cobain
Squad!
