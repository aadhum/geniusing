[Hook: Lil Will]
I'm so icy, so icy
Got a house around my neck
In my hood they call me Jeezy the Snowman
You get it? Jeezy the Snowman
I'm iced out, plus I got snow, man
Let it marinate, y'all niggas slow man
I used to get nineteen for a beat
Call me Ginuwine, the same 'ol G
I'm the shit bitch, I need toilet paper
And some air freshener nigga, fuck a hater
[Hook: Lil Will]
I'm so icy, so icy
She digging my fitted, she think I'm the shit
Got a gold grill but it's not from Eddie
I'm icy, so motherfucking snowed up
Little kids wanna be like Gucci when they grow up
[Hook: Lil Will]
I'm so icy, so icy
I'm hoppin' out the range wit the seats piped out
Spit a little game give 'em that flossin' music
Got a little buzz but Boo been too high
I'm pullin' hoes in the club and I don't even try
I guess when she glance at my wrist, she wanna get my dick
Groupies, show you how to do this son
We throwin' out hundreds while you savin them ones
[Hook: Lil Will]
I'm so icy, so icy
[Hook: Lil Will]
I'm so icy, so icy
