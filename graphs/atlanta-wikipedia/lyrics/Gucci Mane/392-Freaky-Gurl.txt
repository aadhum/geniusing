Yeaa! Yeaa!
She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to mama
3 girls with me like I'm going on Elimidate
Bet your baby-daddy ain't icing like the kid be
My money long as a limo
Just to show off, I put my wrist out the window
I ride through the 6, little kids scream "bingo!"
I fell off in the spotlight, ay, lets mingle
Cause only Gucci can
Drop a rack,
pop your back with a rubberband
Let's do the oochi-coochi
Oh, that's your girlfriend?
Why don't you introduce me
