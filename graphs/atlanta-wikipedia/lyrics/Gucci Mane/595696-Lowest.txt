Gucci Mane I'm from the street
But I got ice all over me
Got my dawg with me
The word around the town, is my price is at the lowest
It's a low down dirty game, but I bet my niggas is the lowest
Don't worry what I'm about to do with this money, cuz this money ain't yours
I'm a billionaire and I'm making, but I guess these niggas don't know it
I'm riding around in a Lambo, and I bet my car the lowest
And I like the way that she drop it down, but her friend go down the lowest
I'm counting money, I'm staying down, I'm hustling with my boys
It's a drought in town, but I'm still good, cuz my price is the lowest
Bentley Coupe, I ride around
Mothafuck 12, free Guwop
