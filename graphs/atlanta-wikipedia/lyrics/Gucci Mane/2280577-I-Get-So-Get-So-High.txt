Can I buy a store today, because my store needs to be fixed
There's a stitch comin' out my 'partment, and man it smell like 40 bricks (Damn)
They used to call me 40 shawty, now they call me extra clip
You can call me Carbon-15, when you see me let it rip
You a crip I'll leave your crippin', and you a blood I'll leave ya bleedin
Drop camaro ridin Cleveland, now they call it Bleveland (Woo)
put
Lord, I get High-ahah, I don't know why-ay
If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e
Lord, I get High-ahah, I don't know why-ay
If I don't drank to day-y I rather die-e (Woo)
Blue Forgi's
Cripin like Nipsey
If you a bad bitch then vogue pose
