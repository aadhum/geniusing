I need everybody to report to the dance floor right now
The world is very different now
You know why
It's Gucci time
Big Gucci, trap boys call me Brick Gucci
Dime piece, time piece got my Swiss moving
Swiss cheese out a hater if he act foolish
Swizz Beats Gucci Mane call it trap music
I think I need an ESPY, these rappers best respect me
They try to Ron Artest me, they gonna have to arrest me
With a doubt I bring 'em out
She cheated with La Flare but its nothing to spill a drink about
Do you know what time it is
Gucci Time
15 past the diamond, bitch
All this ice on no need to cut the lights on
Came in dranking rolling up stanking
White boy wasted frat house wasted
Amazing like my bracelet I'm flossing
R.I.P. the Mike
the ice got my chest moon walking
Pull up in the drop top Ferrari on Bankhead
Colder than a polar bear sleeping in the freezer
She wish she never met me wanna catch amnesia
Gucci Mane crazy I might pull up on a zebra
Land on top a eagle smoke a joint of reefa
Standing on the sofa spilling liquor on the speaker
Call the paralegal cause this shit should be illegal
Keep tocking a tocking to keep ticking
Ya Rollie ain't real if the bitch keep ticking
A hundred thou on the shoe and socks ain't nothing
A hundred thou on the wristband ain't nothing [X2]
