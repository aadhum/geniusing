My main bitch, her anklet
‘Bout the same size of a ankle monitor
Caught a murder charge, but I beat the shit
‘Cause a nigga tried to take my life
Intercept the pack like Lawyer Milloy
I gotta thank the Lord
Sippin’ on lean ‘til I throw up
What you want to be when you grow up?
Young Scooter in my team
Like Pinky, nigga, I’m big and black
Rock so many chains it gon hurt my neck
Bomb squad like “Hoorah!”
