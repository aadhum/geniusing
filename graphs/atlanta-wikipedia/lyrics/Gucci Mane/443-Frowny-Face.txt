Dummy brick-frowny face
Rabbit food-frowny face
Say he wanna face me
Tell em "Come and skraighten me":
SK-frowny face
AK-frowny face
Some niggas tried to wet me up
Shot up my truck in East Atlanta
Want to set me up because I tricked this nigga in Savannah
They put some money on my head, I had to move to Alabama
mixing 'caine with Arm & Hammer
Somebody blooded my face badly my last visit to the slammer
But they put me in that hole because I beat him like a hammer
The shooter shot my nigga Juice a couple times over by Gresham
Wish I was there just to help him
Behind my rights to getting my record
They tried to murk me for my chain
My former label didn't trick me
They just did what was expected
I was self-sufficient before I went independent selling records
I know they're kick theyself in the ass
I'm playing chess, they playing checkers
You can try me if you wanna, but I promise you'll be a goner
My rep just won't let you do that. I tote two straps, thought you knew that
If you come between my crew's stacks (Bricksquad!), I'll lay you flat like a doormat. Gucci!
