Gucci got a super deal on the keys
They say we got the streets sprung on that stupid
Now all they wanna shop with is Dolph and Gucci
my styrofoam muddy
I’m in the hood pumpin’ weight going crazy
Sacking’ up these bales gucci cookin’ up them babies
And the same bitch you kissing on calling’ baby
She asked me to nut in her and let you think thats yo baby
Trapping’ out a fuckin’ loft
50 bricks in the drought fuck it ma lets dole em out
