Drum Squad and Gucci
Gucci Mane and Drumma
Fell in love with bricks
Damn, I love my plug
I'mma stack my cheese
And I'mma sell my p's
Yeah, I'm from the A
A lot of B's and C's
That's Bloods and Crips
Can't forget GD's
My earrings ten kilos
I'm going crazy like Cee-Lo
My dope got a vertical
My kush got a real loud smell
You could smell the shit from Rio
Peanut butter interior
My jewelry game on Frigidaire
My watch cold as Siberia
Red watch with the red chain
My diamonds on they period
All hundreds, got no change
I got dirty money like Diddy
Need to wash them stacks with Ajax
Pockets fat as Kelly Price
