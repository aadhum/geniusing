They talkin' shit from the bench, get in the goddamn game
Say "Hi" Just, y'all meet pretty Jessica
Know she got that good brain, I just keep on testin' her
Don't come with my package, I'mma have to kill the messenger
[Verse 3 - 8Ball]
Got a bitch in every city with a whole lot of back
Smoke a whole lot of weed, ate a whole lot of snacks
Had twenty-eight grams when I fell up in this bitch
Smoked it all 'fore I left, don't make no goddamn sense
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense
Gucci Mane was like "Ball, where you get that bitch?"
Bitch ass so big, don't make no goddamn sense
