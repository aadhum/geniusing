Ijat
He a shooter, with a shooter
What up [?], free Diego
What up Kirbo, what up Rooster, free Kenny
Cats tryna bounce, my youngins blammin’

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I got twin FNs on me, please don’t put your hands on me
No yellow tape, but when you see him I want you to grab homie
But if I see him before you see him then I’ma blam homie
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me
Only thing I pray is that this gun don’t jam on me

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Go green light, get him, rush him, fuck him
Stick him, stuck him, grab him, slab him
[?] rhyming, always keep my pistol handy
Wanna go to war that’s fine and dandy
Easier than snatching up baby candy
Clip big as a baby panda
RIPs are hard to handle
Gucci and a murder scandal
Call my lawyer, fuck a [[?]
[?] o’clock
man
