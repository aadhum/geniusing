So Icy Boys bitch, we shine like a light house
Frost bite
Klondike
Polar bear neck wear
I was born in Iceland
Fifty thousand feet up, lookin' out the window
Was a little turbulence but Gucci ain't scared tho
The way I check a nigga you think I work 4 Nike (just do it)
Jake blue & white it remind me of a slurpee
Blue & green stones like the tail of a mermaid
Cartoon chain cuz my brain Nickelodeon
Freestyle flow, you would think a nigga wrote this shit
