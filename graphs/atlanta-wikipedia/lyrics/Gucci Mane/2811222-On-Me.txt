A thug's life don't matter. We don't give a shit about you damn thugs, your life don't matter. And you sons of bitches, you fixin' to find out how it don't matter cause you done pissed us off, you bunch of bastards
I put my first gat first, then sting, I don't think
I need a detox cause I've been smoking kush all week
And if I piss some dirty urine then I'm up shit creek
My money lanky, taller than a man 6 foot 3
My left pinky nine karat diamond cut so neat
And if I told you what it cost, you would say "golly"
I spend 50k a month and that's just on chains
I got a carbon 15 sitting on my front seat
And plus my shoes'll eat your face like bon appetit
The feds looking at me, know they got they eyes on me
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
I feel like 2Pac when he made All Eyez On Me
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
I keep the Glock on me
Stupid Glock on me
I can't let 'em get the drop on me
I keep a nine on me, stupid nine on me
Lord knows I got guap on me
Stupid rocks on me, crazy rocks on me
I paid a million for this watch on me golly
And my bricks so young, my birds gon' need ID
She wanna stay with me, know that I'ma faithfully
I'm like a drug to her, she can't walk away from me
Police survalliance I know they fuckin' taping me
But all they gonna see is diamond cars and currency
