(Southside)
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
10 out of 10 got a tool on 'em
Wolves foaming at the mouth, got drool on 'em
Got a Mossberg, Metro Boom on 'em
Project baby, no father figure
Only 15 and he a father nigga
Lil bitty nigga with a big extendo
His dope fiend auntie was his baby sitter
Hard head mama can't do nothing with him
But get on her knees and pray the skreets don't kill him
The skreets don't kill him, then the law gon' get him
Better listen to me kid, it's a fucked up system
Y'all might don't feel him but I damn sure feel him
Cause I was just in a jail cell fucked up with him
