Zaytoven baby
I drive real fast baby I don't drive slow
I don't drive slow, I don't drive slow
Drop the top on that thang just to let ya hair blow
Let ya hair blow, let ya hair blow
If you scared go to church cause I'm fin' ta drive fast
Throwing cash out the brains of a '74 Oldsmo'
Cornerstore, Amoco, Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Niggas want that work, lil shawty meet right by Gresham Road
I'm smoking on that kush so it's stankin up my car
Skittle up yo' chain, turn your watch to Starburst too
Put them Lemonheads in yo' ears
Put them Fruity Pebbles on yo' fingers, now you envied by yo' peers
I'mma ride down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels
I'mma roll down the block like a damn X pill
Standin tall on them sixes like some damn high heels
Try me and your body filled with embalming fluid
