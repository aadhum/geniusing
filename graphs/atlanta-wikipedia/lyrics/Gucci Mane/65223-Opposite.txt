Earring same size as cantaloupes
Hands on like a iPhone or a laptop or a iPad
So I make money like a ballplayer
So my pockets look like thigh pads
I'm the man, got the car with the trunk in the rear
Five mil a year, that's Gucci
Sir Mix-a-Lot, serve bricks a lot
Got a big old watch on my time clock
And I ain't even have to go to no chop shop
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Southside
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
Money don't make me, I make money
Make a hundred million, God willing
Leave a hundred million to my little children
Got no ceiling and no feelings
Got two million on my ice bill
In a Maserati on Candler Road
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Southside
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
I was locked up, no sunshine
Now I'm out and I'm balling too hard
At Magic City, I'm getting loaded
Got four o's in my soda pop
I'm so faded, I'm so wasted
I thought that I had dreadlocks
Roll orange and I drink grape
Put my trunk in the front, that's the opposite
All red guts, but the paint is chocolate
Steering wheel on the side, that's the opposite
Southside
Love stacking cabbage, but I'm smoking broccoli
