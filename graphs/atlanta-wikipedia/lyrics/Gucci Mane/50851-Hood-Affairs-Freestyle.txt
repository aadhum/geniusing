I was trapping like a fool, me and that fat fool
Kept that fucking tool, didn't go to school
I really don't give a shit
'Bout a pussy ass nigga, a pussy ass ho
It's Gucci Mane La Flair, my chain look like rainbow
We smoking out in public, you know them bitches love it
I'm a real trap nigga
Bust it out the wrapper, sell it to a trapper
I was going to the atrium, like a gymnasium
Beat like a fool, that was 1998, I was still getting cake
Me and Zay, we shitting in ya' face
(no idea what he says) cost 1 38
And I got it from my deal,so what does that tell ya'
