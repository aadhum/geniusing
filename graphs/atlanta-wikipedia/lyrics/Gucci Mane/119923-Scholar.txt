I could sprinkle you with game, but you just too fuckin' lame
I can put you up on something, but you still wouldn’t learn nothing
You know the game ain't to be sold man,
I spent half of my life nigga sellin' crack cocaine
I’m a victim of the dope game, I don’t like to name names
I don’t like to name drop
I just like cocaine drops
If you got a old car, then go get a new one
2 sons
I told her baby call me Mr. Never Ever Use A Coupon
Baby got that slow dome
my trap like a group home
I’m bad with niggas, but I’m good with bitches
Rag to riches, no pot to piss in
Three years goin' I ain’t seen no Christmas
Six months goin' I ain’t seein' no drought
Work so good they don’t ever get slow
Burglar bar doors on all my houses
I’mma put hardwood on all of my floors
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
Hit the club I'm clean as hell, but yeah I got them dirty dollars
Pull up in three Phantoms like I’m Creflo damn Dollar
Deep dishs pizzas on my chargers, tryna dodge every pothole
I’m a young nigga but I OG
I’m solo, no Co-De
Dog a bitch, drag a bitch, so bad I need a damn collar
