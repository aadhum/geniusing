Higher Than A Palm Tree
And Flyer Than A Jet Be
Freaky As An Old Man, Sneaky As A Car Thief
Up In That Rarri Same Color As Coffee
Ima Run My Stacks Up Yella Bones Attract Me
Text
I Toated It And Totaled It I Didn't Think You'd Notice It, Get Out My Mind Jump In My Car I'm On That Billy Ocean Shit
Just Like Levert I Like To Flirt I'm Not Your Casanova
I Shine Too Bright With Stupid Ice, I Shouldve Left My Chain At Home
Brain Blowed Back Im Gettin' Dome Ridin' Right Past The Georgia Dome
