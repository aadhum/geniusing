1017 Dreamteam
Eating them percocetes like they was baked beans
Peewee Longway with me that's my blood brother
My life's a gangsta movie man I love colors
Ten G's of molly on me so i brought sand to the beach
Feel like I just came here on a banana boat
Like Curtis Blow I got to blow
Like Bruce Leroy I got to glow
I do a show like I'm selling dope
I rep for the hood it's a dope show
Me and Wop in a Bentley flying down 20
The Trus got me looking lean homey
But I ain't sticky cut some lean on it
These niggas trick u with the lean I buy PT's only
