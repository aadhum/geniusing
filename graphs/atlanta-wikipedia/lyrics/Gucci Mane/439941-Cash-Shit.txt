Ice Cream Man Gucci
I got a trap house, time to check my crack house
I got a lean house, I got a stash house
I still pass bricks out
Sixes on my Charger, sittin' like a skyscraper
I'mma fly ass nigga since the junior high
You a lie, say you see me in some Levi's
I don't do nothing, just got a 40 Cal
I'm in the Louis Vuitton store signing autographs
It's Guwop
I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah, I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
Say I'm a millionaire, yeah, yeah
I'm a millionaire, got millionaire friends
You don't like Gucci? Fuck your opinion
I'm 4th and and long and you niggas 3rd and inches
