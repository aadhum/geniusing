"Listen to the track BITCH!" echoes
(Brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr) Gucci (brr-brr!)
The pretty bitches love me, them bitches love me
I think them bitches love that I'm a bottle popper
I used to sell them things in triangles
And that was when I was in the eighth grade
Now I'm self made; and I'm high paid
Nigga you ain't even in my tax bracket
I pull up in that black and red Challenger
A com-pe-tition, where the challengers?!
Gucci Mane I run the land from Africa to Pakistan
Magic City throw some change
she been feelin me.. and y'all got that novocaine
Go for mine, that ball shit, pour Ciroc 'til I'm nauseous
Stuck up when, she sober when, she rollin got no conscience
She OD's on Louboutin, she work at that nudie bar
Told her do it for the money, get your Cameron Newton on
Green we can all burn(AuBurn), 'til I am the highest man(heisman)
Way a nigga be in gals you'd think I know Esiason
