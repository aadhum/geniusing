There's some dirty birds in town: Gucci Mane & Waka Flame
We fly in, Iâ€™m buyin, say you got more birds? You lyin'
I pitch like Nolan Ryan,
purp
and I'm slurring my words
bang my Forgi's on the curb
Gucci!
My homeboys will get you, Pay you on the Thirty-Third
Two pints of lean will have me slurring on my words
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird (Nyoom!)
All the hoods love us like the Fifteenth and the First
Undertaker car, triple black drop bird
My hood right side, nigga, Green flaggin'
7 grams in the Swisher, I'm gon' solo that
You will never be turnt up like my partner Flock
