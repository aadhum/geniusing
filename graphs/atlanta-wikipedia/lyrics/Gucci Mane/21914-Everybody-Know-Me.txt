Big Cat
Growin up was real hard on my block
Cops and robbers I was never the cop
To be the cop was considered a joke
I got beef with BMF and I got problems with Jeezy
To be a gangster is a full time job
A Bad Boy but I ain't Black Rob
You disrespect me I'mma send ya to Grady
An ex-con but I'm out on bond
Wave bye to the bad guys, Teflon Don
Gucci Mane out of jail man, what I'm gon' do now
That Jeezy lil' bitch ass thinkin out loud
