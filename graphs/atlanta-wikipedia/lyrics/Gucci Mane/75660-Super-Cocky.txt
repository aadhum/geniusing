Call me Liberaci
Gucci mane
I got money in every pocket in my cargo
Pull up in a largo
for shouting loco
An egg beaters my logo
I put diamonds all in my crucifix
Y'all know how I do this shit
I swear he cross dress grandmama
Pull out clean I love to stunt
The backs the front, the fronts the trunk
Smoked out the pound, we crown the blunt
Scram if you ain't serving grams
