You niggas know how much I made on my twenties
Your baby daddy book I buried in our twenties
In 1995, I ain’t had a pretty pinckney
Sometimes I do a show the say the wanna shot me
My own status can’t touch me
No you can’t touch me

[Chorus:]
Got a hundred nigga rush
Hundred nigga rush
Not a rush with them all with me
Rush them all with me
Dare a nigga fucking touch me
Dare a nigga touch me
Got a hundred Russian nigga
And they say the wanna rush up
Drinking Vodka with a Russian bitch
You know I wanna fuck
Tell her never say a dope again
Never say a dope again
Whippin dope
I’m whippin dope  and not a junkers rushing in
pope bag
never
to chill
