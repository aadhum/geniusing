Latino plug
Don't speak no English
When we talk
We use a finger
Jumping like it's Blake Griffin
You can say I'm water whipping
Balling out
You penny pinching
Cooking dope in momma's kitchen
Hide the bales off in the ceiling
Vacuum seal a half-a-milli
Thousand pounds of midget dick
Fuck it I'm just reminiscing
