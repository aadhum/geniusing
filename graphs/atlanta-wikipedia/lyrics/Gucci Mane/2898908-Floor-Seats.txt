Free my niggas in the chain gang (free, fuck 12, ay)
They get floor seats to everything (ay, yeah)
Floor seats at the Barclays (ay, yeah)
No penny from a young nigga, Penny Hardaway (ay)
Gucci and Quavo like Steph and Klay, we the splash brothers
Jewelry so flavorful, check out Fader, the last cover
Designers clash, designer frames, expensive glass
I'm too bold to brag and I might be too old to sag
And I just bought a Rolls cause I'm too cold to buy a Jag
They get floor seats to everything (ay, yeah)
No penny from a young nigga, Penny Hardaway (ay)
