Leavin out ya house, thirty pounds in my book bag
You a head bussa punch yo hand wit yo fist den
Franchise hate me, probly wanna kill me
I lay up in ya yard, rob ya when ya go to church
Ya love white tees now ya face on the shirt
Got a black pistol grip pump on the seat
Black tee, O.G., nigga don't approach me
[Verse 2: Bun B]
Reppin UGK and PAT in his black tee
Free Pimp C on the back of his black tee
Got 36 O's for the 2-1
Jeezy bout them green guys
Got my four-x black tee up under my jersey
I got the all black Chevy on all black rims
Keep a small black gat in my all black Tims
On the all-black leather there's a all-black mac
Tryin to snatch get ya black ass blowed the fuck back
Kick do' ya granny house and put it to a cataract
Gorillas wit banana clips goin monkey in the back
They'll put yo ass in that black box, laid out flat
Yup in my black tee, wit the nine underneath
Workin in my black tee, smokin purple in my black tee
