[Hook : Quavo]
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, 'aight
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, I'm straight
My momma, my sisters are 'aight
My money, my pockets are 'aight
I'm straight, I'm cool, 'aight
Don't need to worry about me, 'aight?
Aight, 'aight, 'aight, fuck nigga
I'mma get mine by any means
My pockets on take off finna take flight
When Gucci called my manager, that night it changed my life
Goin' hard in the paint on these pussy ass niggas
