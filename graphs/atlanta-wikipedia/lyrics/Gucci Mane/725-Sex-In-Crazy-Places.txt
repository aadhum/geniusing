I wanna do you at yo Mama house, on the couch
Do you in the bathroom of the airplane
Do you on a balcony, in the taxi
Cause I canâ€™t get enough of that thing
Let's do up in Disney at the Magic Kingdom
You can tug on my Giuseppes and my Bagley Mischkas
I'm a pro with them balls like And 1
Do him like his momma make him eat his vegetables
Can call me a stage mom, boy you best to blow
call me Wanda cause I'm "ret ta go"
stomps the floor
on Fifth Ave in the Department store
joker
six-flags
and drill you on the roller coaster
Call your girlfriends over, we can have a sleepover
You like the way I bend, now you asking where I've been
If I'm doing him, now you starting that again?
I dont wanna sex ya friend. He don't got enough to lend
