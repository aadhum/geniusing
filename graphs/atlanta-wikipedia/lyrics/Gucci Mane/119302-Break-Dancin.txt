Pistol in the club with me, I don't wanna break dance
This Mac 11 gon make a nigga strip, like a shake down
My favorite weapon Mac 11, black and red pant leather lavish
Was so broke in '97, pray the bread would come from heaven
Niggas used to laugh when I walk from Boulder Crest to Gresham
So who’s laughing last, I just pulled up in a 911
Atlanta Overlook apartments, just came back from overseas
If I can do it, you can do it, you started with more than me
Mom couldn't really do much for me, so broke used to eat lunch for free
Backstab so many people, that my buds won’t even pass the blunt to me
Yeah fuck nigga I stole your bomb, hope that ends your mystery
And if it's all about the timing, my time piece cost 80 g's
Got a rifle with my dog like a hunter bae
Red bottom add the spikes, I’m a punter!
She wanna suck all of these Snickers, she got hunger
500 horses on my motherfucking tires
I'll splat his ass up put that on fiver
Everybody with me eating, we got fiber
In the kitchen, wrapping, rapping like a cypher
Told you one too many times, we got dimes, it’s my prime time
Ridin' with king slime, that’s my slime
K spank yo behind
