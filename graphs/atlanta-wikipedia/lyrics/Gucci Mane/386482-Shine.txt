I'm gon' shine you know I'm gunna shine
You're ice-less
I'm icy
Fresh up out the hole
I said bitch smell that? Thats hard times
So much shit up on my mind
My waist line is a Glock nine
That bitch stick to me like tattoos
Red Flag in his pocket
Million doller nigga but I still eat Church's
Old school 'vet like I'm fuckin' James Worthy
But I'm shootin' from the corner like I'm fuckin' Bobby Hurly
Yo bitch wanna top me up
Purple in my cup
Nigga try to take something from me, get Usher burned
