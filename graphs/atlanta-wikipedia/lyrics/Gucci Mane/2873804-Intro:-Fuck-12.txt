I still don't give a fuck how a fuckboy feel
I ain't never been embarrassed, I ain't never felt fear
skresses
I ain't even been out 6 months, but I spent 6 mil
In the kitchen going skrt-skrt tryna make a mil
When I was 16, I was making drug deals
Say it once again, trust God, fuck 12
A real skreet nigga will never ever call 12
