My trap beating harder than a bass drum(x3)
I need an extra hand, I needs 3 extra stoves
I keep that white girl like a white man
East Atlanta zone 6 you in trap land
My money got a vert, my shit jump out the gym
She don't really like me but she love my rims
Yellow Lamborghini same color my butter Tims
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' harder than your trap boom
When I hit a lick it I bought a wingstop (Twenty of em)
I sprinkle lemon pepper
Got my bond money, I got my lawyer fee
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' hard, bitch I swear to God
My trap boomin' harder than your trap boom
