Crazy Mane
with the crazy chains
HOLIDAY SEASON!
I got these bitches taking pictures of my candy chain
But I stay dead fly like a private plane
If you don't know about the ki, then I must explain
Everything that I got, owe it to cocaine
I'm insane in the brain like Saddam Hussein
I came, I conquered,
chain,
Two dames on the train, got that English brain
Cause my money real long like a modern train
Gucci Guwop up in the drop playing 2Pac
Taking 2 shots of Ciroc
?
Taking me some blocks off the top, I gotta re-rock
42 grand in my pants
Teton
The hustler don't stop on my block
sheet rock
Gram after gram
Last couple days it been hotter than a teapot
Sig
Count all my money with my chain
60 grand in my pocket, that's a drop-top Stang
I'mma shave it off the top, get some extra caine
