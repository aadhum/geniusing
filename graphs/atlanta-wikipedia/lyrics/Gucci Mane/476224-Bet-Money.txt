Break a 9 to a bunch of dimes then you grind up
Money got me showin my ass can't even hold my pants up
20 niggas standin on the flat all getting off
Found a junkie dead in Brooke Lake with his hands sawed
Try me in the 6 I'm gone raise this 45 up
Shave a brick put it back together that's a lineup
Remix the chick use a little cut that's a temp fade
And if he got a chopper never ever bring a switchblade
I'd give a nigga my whole stash if he can take this jewelry off me
They said I couldn't get rich out here bet money
All that sideline talk don't make no money
Hit yo bitch then leave her with no money
Gotta have that green like Gumby
And these hoes catch the vapors like Biz Markie
