We been stunting
Got a money tree
I drown the bitch with money
Ferrari with
Them bumble-bee
Forgiato sitting up under it
("How many carats in that bracelet baby?")
I think about 200
These kats are trying to go downtown
Just to walk around and window shop
I shut them all down everytime
Cover of the magazine
Back of the limousine
612 sitting outside the facilities
Houses in Zone 6
And Purple Label
Drank purple drank
Smoke purple weed
Got a purple car
Stay blocked up
