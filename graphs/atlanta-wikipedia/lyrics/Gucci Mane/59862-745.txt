Seven forty fivvvvveeeeee baby
For all my nigga having they' Benz..
Came outta jail on a monday morning
Whole world watchin' like I was performing
745 with the gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
Left big cat and I signed back breez
Word on the street that I dont like jeezy
Beat them other rap niggas change the subject
Yellow diamonds same color as mustard
Blue diamonds same color the tarheels
Red diamonds like the section where Game live
Niggas scared to sign me cuz I beef too much and they heard that I stay in the streets too much
Knee deep in the game
Im ahead of my time
60 gs I spent jus for tellin the time
Im the hood homeboy
The ghetto trophy
Niggas hatin on me so I can't stay focused
I might look gravy but im smokin that kushy
Im not a killa but you pussies done pushed me
Im tryna live I ain't tryna die
So I'd rather yo momma cry then my momma cry (bitch)
745 wit the gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 wit the gucci interior man I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirror
745 wit the gucci interior
I see a real nigga when I look in the mirror
745 wit the gucci interior
I see a rich nigga when I look in the mirro
Now what would you do if a nigga tried you
And you chillin wit a bitch
And some niggas came through would you run like a chick or stand like man
Nigga tell me when you piss do you sit or do you stand
My daddy tote a
llama
I learned from my momma so I hit him wit the thunda
I coulda been dead but im still breathin
Do I smell pussy? Naw thats Jeezy
you ain't a snowman you more like a snowflake
Cupcake cornflake nigga you too fake
2 Glocks shawty ay lets party
I'm at the 40 40 looking for sean cartayy (uh) man I love to beef couldn't wait to get home cuz I love the streets
745
wit the gucci interior
