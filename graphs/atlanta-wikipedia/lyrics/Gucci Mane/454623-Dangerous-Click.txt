They say Gucci rap about drugs, want to boycott
Got your baby mama in my condo with boy shorts
Just another nigga with a gun, you’s a toy car
And my real name is Gucci Mane, but Guwop is my alias
1017 Brick Squad Records, and we are the most hated clique
Scrape 8 bodies, killed it and dumped it on 26
Your little girl, but she 26 and damn little mama ate a bit
This OG weed I got it lit, I call it ivy
PeeWee Longway you the shit, the OG weed supplier
Boys in the hood sell anything for profit
Wrap you up like gyro,
sipping mud out the styro
Foam, two cups got me gone, two red bitches I fuck on
When I’m geeked up in my zone, LONGWAY LONGWAY
[Hook – Jose Guapo]
1017, we America’s most wanted
And we gon serve these drugs to whoever damn want it
Yeah you know it’s that A-1, when you see our stamp on it
Making plays off the white, lean, and the marijuana (juug)
If you run up on the squad, boy you know that you’s a goner
Got questions bout the squad, just go ask your baby mama
This squad gon have it locked for the next ten summers
Sipping mud, rolling up OG that come from Humboldt
Smoking Cali weed, stupid OG on my last B
I got this pretty little tender on me, she just 23
Gang sticky as a swisher sweet that I drink with lean
[Verse 4 – Jose Guapo]
