Please pardon me but I'm passin gas
To my entourage, no gas masks
I'm in my old school, with the Georgia tag
With my Georgia ass and my red flag
I'm g'd up from the feet up
I was low key, at HB
I went toe to toe with the best of 'em
I bust shots at the rest of 'em
I rape you, like Chester
Run up on me put you in a ditch quick nigga
I'm a tell you twice, cause it's Gucci two times
Fuck your clique and fuck your wife
If you got drama nigga, you can meet me outside
Get your head bust wide for your old man's pride
Platinum in my mouth bitch
Priceless
Bugattis when we shinin bitch
Blood rich gang nigga
I put red shoes on my black car
Rich young G with gold teeth
A triple black cat just crossed my path
But its a 4 door jaguar
Im black as hell but im rich as well
Im strapped up, no body guards
I put 100 K on my grill shawty
