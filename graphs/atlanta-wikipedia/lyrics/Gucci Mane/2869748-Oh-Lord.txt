I'd rather die for my freedom than live like a peasant
Depressions, recessions, the past and the present
I gotta feed the family
But I had to leave the family
I cut off CMB, I'm an amputee
But I never leave Christianity
Might have to plead insanity
It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
I'mma pray for you niggas, then celebrate
But Lord I can't get beat like Anna Mae
Lord I gotta think about Reginae
And Lil Tune and Lil Neal and Lil Cameron
Willing to kill you just for my fortunes
I can recall we were chillin' on porches
Living with roaches, dealin' with hoe shit
Ceilings to low shit, now we in motion, everything kosher
God bless the 'Nolia, God bless Angola
Rest in Peace Soulja  and all of the soldiers
