Hello?
Yeah?
What up?
Nothing
You dry
Its 3 o'clock in the morning out here
How? Ah its 3 hour difference doe, never mind
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
You niggas haten' constantly
But I don’t take it personally
And I am not ashamed to say
And I think about my family constantly
Your friend constantly h
Hitting my phone! Constantly
These feds steady tapping my phone
Think they onto me
Every time she whine, I'm like, “OK?”
I don’t want to hear that shit, not today
Let me check my watch
24 in a day and its 12 up in my watch
Ballin' hard, like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
You niggas haten' constantly
But I don’t take it personally
And I am not ashamed to say
And I think about my family constantly
