Tarantino
Woke up today a decision to  make, I skeet on her chest  or I skeet on her face
That lean is my drank and that pussy my supper
Her ass keep clapping, Magnolia Magnolia
Got bricks like a mummy
We ridin' on Bentleys, we started from MARTA
We come from the street, I'm full, I can't eat
Ain't nobody starving, Monique Parker
Turn up...
