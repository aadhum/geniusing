This for my nigga Dunk, he gone
The squad really miss you! Aha!
What's up, Slim?
This for my nigga Dunk, he gone, I really miss you
When you died, man, a part of me died, too!
This for my nigga, for you know, I really miss you
And every time you're doing time, I'm doing time too!
Aha, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Gucci Mane, time too, time too
Time too, time too
Time too, time too
And I tell that, play up, time too, time too!
