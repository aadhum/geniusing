Well, I'm blowin' kush, endorsin' it
For those that ain't as fortunate
I work my wrist
Got babies like the orphanage
Got cabbage like a cabbage patch
Got collard greens and turnips, bitch
My trap boomin' like Bloomingdale's
Got bank like Lloyd, Yayo like Tony
But won't give you 50 cent
I brush my teeth with purp codeine
I wash my face with bottled water
All my whips got superchargers
He faker than Harry Potter
He try to turn up with two hundred ones
He's makin' me laugh
I drink my champagne out the bottle, nigga
I don't fuck with no glass
So many gualas in my pants, nigga
It's makin' me sag
Had a good day
And then I went and bought a Rollie
Say I'm smokin' loud and they complainin'
'Bout the noise and fragrance
Cause my verses are amazing
Think I'm walking through a maze
When I'm walking through the station
Drawing pictures with my words
While these other niggas tracin'
That nigga stuntin', just damn near killed the scene
I just poured me up a pint of that purple
I donâ€™t like red
