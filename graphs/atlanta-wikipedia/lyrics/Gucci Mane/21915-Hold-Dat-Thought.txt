Pockets Piggly Wiggly, caine Kermit the Frog dawg
Ten bricks on my Bart Simpson, just look
Ham I got a real good J
One gram for the eighty, that's a real good play
I'm not athletic, but I'mma straight baller
Say boy you lightnin fast, or the Utah Jazz
Catch me on the rebound, like Bo Outlaw
I'mma Mikey Vick it, whip it, cook it southpaw
Made a sho' hard move, and used my cell phone
Always scramblin in the pot, just like Steve Young
