She want to sex me of course
Cause I pull up in a Porsche
I make love to the money
Got a shit load of hundreds
Got a bag full of loud
Got a hand full of 20’s
I threw that shit in the crowd
I’m playing 50 and Gucci
Don’t play with 50 or Gucci
All my fans protest at my most recent arrest
And little mama want to creep with me
I know she want to sleep with me
It gotta be the g in me
Cause ain't no R&B in me
Mr. TMZ
50 and Gucci nigga this shit equals bread
We get the check from the music, we get the cash from the trap
When it comes to the money nigga we right where its at
Lambo round that autobahn, speeding like I bought a lot
Ain't got to talk to get a bitch, what you think we bought it for
The way it bling makes dope boys want to move crack
