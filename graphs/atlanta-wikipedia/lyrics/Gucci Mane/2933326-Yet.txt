My bitch ring cost 2 M&M's and I ain't been out a year yet
You burning all your bridges nigga I'ma call you Bridgette
You acting like a bitch you mad cause you ain't made a hit yet
This trap rap that influencing the world man Gucci pioneered it
I just vacuum sealed a couple mill, I know real niggas feel that
Gucci can't retire cause he ain't made a hundred mill yet
Keep on talkin' slick, I send my shooters where you live at
Pow pow pow, put that pistol where your grill at
Lil mama sucking it like she love me
I ain't even pay the bills yet
I was worth two hundred fifty thou, didn't even have a deal yet
[?] dickin' down, we ain't even done it yet
They bring it to me
I call you Raphael cause you hang with a sewer rat
I can't hang with no informer, I'm too hood for that
