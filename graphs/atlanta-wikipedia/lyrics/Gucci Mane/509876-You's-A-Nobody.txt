If I put a hundred thousand in the Charger
Do that make me a moron?
If I drop a quarter million on the chain
Does that make me insane?
Drop a quarter million on the bracelet
Does that make me crazy?
If a drop a million dollars on the Bugatti (car)
Does that make me somebody? (stuntin')
You in the V.I.P. with me
Bitch, still you know you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
I don't know you, nigga, cause you's a nobody
You's a nobody, you's a nobody
You don't know me, nigga, you don't know nobody
If I gave a damn what people thought
I probably wouldn't have shit
Gamblin' for fifty cents, from fifty G's to fifty keys
2015, got the C like fifty M's on fifty M's
Yes I do shoot missiles ho
My pistol dismember folks
That's your mouth and
That's your nose and
That's the route you chose to go
