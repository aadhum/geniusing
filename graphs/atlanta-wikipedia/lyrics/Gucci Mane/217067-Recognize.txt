You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
You funny, used to walk away from me
Same bitch in my face talking ‘bout I ain’t had no money
Do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
Say do you recognize me?
‘Cause now you’re all in my face, while I’m splashing all in your face
Well remember 1994, Freaknik, man I ain't had shit
In '96 the Olympics came and I ain't had shit
Used to walk outside DeKalb mall broker than a bitch
Window shoppin', window shoppin', I ain't have shit
Bought a 50 slab for Christmas it was the best money I've ever spent
Black Migo Gang you better recognize
Quarter million worth of watches just to tell the time
I just left Colombia the streets is mine
And everybody rich nigga that I'm around
