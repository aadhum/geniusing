Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a chopper
Well, I bounce in past the bouncer, with a handgun and a rifle
No place the GuWop can’t go
Trap rap, fuck hip-hop, ho
Rambo with a loaded four-four
Commando, kick in your front door
Jesús, Alejandro
Get your whole family killed like El Chapo
Lots of guap and escundo
Let your daddy know, twin Calicos
And I’ll kill your ass if you like to gamble
County man, if your ass didn’t know
Like Cunningham I make your ass ran, ho
Afghanistan, I’m a travelling man
And when I pull up, got an army van
You must live in Fantasy Land
Candyman, I’m from the scrap
You ain’t no gangster, pussy nigga, youse a World Star bully
Just a key-boy gangster, talking tough as your train
