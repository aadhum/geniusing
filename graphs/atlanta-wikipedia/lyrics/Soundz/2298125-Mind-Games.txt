Let's have a conversation with the competition
I’m finna rip your constituents in your composition
Your confidence and your compliments was all a compilation
It gets intimate as I implement all the complications
That ain't your jump shot
That's a fixed rim
Thought it was peaches and cream
That shit a bit slim
I pen puns like Pun's pen
Beat you niggas at everything
And  still ain't got one win
Okay, six rings bells to me
Sick things
Jordan had six rings
This some 3-6 mafia sixteens
Had 99 problems
I had to flip on you bitches
But when they upside down
I’m number 6 from the 6ers, that’s Doctor
Jay the only one that deserve my accolade
Kicked a freestyle but I ain't ever did a track with 'Ye
It ain't no secret
It's the shit that every rapper say
The shit a nigga rap is the shit these rappers would rather say
I'm way up like I sleep in the attic
I feast on the weak and dramatic
Look how deeply I crafted these verses
Niggas cop my shit just to keep it in plastic
Peep it, I'm classic
We could let the wiz khali
It's always the ones that's so honest that got some shit to hide
I say this in cadence on haters go find a dick to ride
I waited with patience to make it
And now I'm dignified
You a bush, nigga
Who been the worst leader?
We got something in common
I ain't write this verse either
