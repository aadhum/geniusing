I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just got another roll of new hundreds
And I can’t say I call myself a role model
But I just copped another round of gold bottles
Role models used to be the brick man
Now the role models got to be the hitman
Topped the charts, making art like a young Da Vinci
My pockets filled with money rolls and his wallet empty
[?] ears
