Shout out to my crew, let’s start a revolution
Screaming fuck 12, fuck the institutions
Niggas didn’t know it, now they see him moving
I’m be my gang
just
Thought I did the shit by myself, it was OGG
Sitting in the cabin, smoking on the cabbage
And I know these niggas smoking babbage
And you said you smashed her, you lying, I smashed it
It's tragic, man it’s like a tragedy
Screaming fuck 12
Grah grah if he started moving
And I fucked your bitch cause I seen her choosing
Fuck the rules, bitch we all in
Bout to get the money, split it with my friends
We got funds bitch, what you want?
I’m having fun bitch, what you want?
We got the guns bitch, what you want?
We ain’t talking we don’t fucking tussle
Screaming fuck 12,
