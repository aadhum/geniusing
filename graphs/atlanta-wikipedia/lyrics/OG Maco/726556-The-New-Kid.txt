I came to change lives, really, all jokes aside
Went from drivin’ buggies to drivers after flight
And life is so amazing, made me write this when I’m tired
But if this is my exhaust, then how the fuck they gon’ survive?
The survival of the fittest, and
they swettin’ too much
No erectile
Dire situation when the check round
Giving daps and pounds ask for any help
Then blow up my phone up when you was blowin’ your own check
Safe to bet, that’s a nigga only in it for himself
