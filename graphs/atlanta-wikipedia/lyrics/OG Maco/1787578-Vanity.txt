I got hate in me
I got love, I can't trust, so it stays in me
But it's breaking free, feel it changing me
I'm just maintaining me
I feel lost to me
I was scared, I was lost, it was hard to me
I'm a ghost, I'm what's left, of the past of me
I can't live like this
I feel broke and sold
Feel I'm lost in the cold, Is this hope in me?
This how it suppose to be?
I was dying just from living, now I'm breathing for us
Don't believe the guys
Finally rely on that voice inside
