New McLaren vision
pain Created wisdom
All this game I give can help create a better system
On a monstrous mission, haters like that Gollum creature
Victory is short distance, millimeter never inches
Took my pot to piss in, whip it till it change consistence
Forever stay persistent just to make my haters feel it
I was out here working, now I'm out here winning
Audi A7, perfect time to get it
Niggas tried to chuck my CDs like they playing discus
I never falter, slightly alter, but the same description
Wet sign getting covered but I never slip
Know some youngins lost their lives before they ever lived em
If they cross you kill em, just be ready for that sentence
We don't do cold defendants, trust in god and not these niggas
