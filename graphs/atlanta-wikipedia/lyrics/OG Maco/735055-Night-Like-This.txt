On a night like this
Who knows what we sipping on
On a night like this
Room full of clouds, we've been chiefing strong
On a night like this, we hope it never ends ‘less we get to some’
On a night like this, on a night like this
We the type to get it lit
Fire in our lungs, what you smokin' on?
Have you ever faced a zip
These niggas ain't sayin' nothin' like they bank statements
You don't love this money you just love complaining
