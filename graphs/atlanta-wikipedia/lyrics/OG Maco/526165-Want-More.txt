Livin' days, I ain't slept in days, hit the the fourth one
Pull the rage and I'm out the cage, when I'm on the stage
If i ain't top Five its cuz im top two
Bitch, you guessin, now they want more
Competition, fuck the competition
Euros too, stack a million yen
In the pistol with the read option
Couple scrambles, now I'm outta pocket
Heroin and music, watch it rock me
I'm a star like my new Givenchy, on that topic where is Erykah
Tell Badu I wanna touch her, just confessin', I ain't Usher
how you run the pie
Put in work on your birthday
