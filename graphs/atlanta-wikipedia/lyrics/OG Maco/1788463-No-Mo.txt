Where the fuck is our common sense
All I see is our common sins
Excrement in our testaments
Scumbags is our common friends
No sustenance in these substances
No substitutes, no hindrances
Indifference is our poison
We know our problems make more of them
Peace of mind when that checkâ€™s signed
Leasing lies to those overviews
And all crowned jewels should be to you
