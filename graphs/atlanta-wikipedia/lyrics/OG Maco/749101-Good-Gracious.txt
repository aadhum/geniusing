All my life I been fuckin' waitin' (all my life)
All my life I been fuckin' patient (all my life)
I was on the block, while you on vacation
Selling medicine to the patients
All I can say is good gracious
You thought I be flippin' chickens and I'm stirrin' gravy
Look at me now all you can say is good gracious (good gracious)
You thought I would be locked down, modern day slavery (locked down)
Just look at me now all you can say is good gracious
Me and my brothers kicking doors every summer
The neighbor say she gonna tell my mother
If she found out, man her heart would crumble
We was family before they called us gang
Lost half to the chain gang
pro
Good gracious, the way my life is changing
You was the man back then now you ain't shit
Wanna get mad nigga, baow, I'm strapped I got a lawyer for the cases
All my life I been fuckin' waitin' (all my life)
All my life I been fuckin' patient (all my life)
I was on the block, while you on vacation
Selling medicine to the patients
All I can say is good gracious
You thought I be flippin' chickens and I'm stirrin' gravy
Look at me now all you can say is good gracious (good gracious)
You thought I would be locked down, modern day slavery (locked down)
Just look at me now all you can say is good gracious
Money growin' like vegetation
Money walls in the basements
Been hustlin', finessin' since breakfast
R.I.P Tony Robinson
Niggas get shot everyday being Niggas play the fool if you ask me
Blue ink on my thumbs from the faces
All my life I been fuckin' waitin' (all my life)
All my life I been fuckin' patient (all my life)
I was on the block, while you on vacation
Selling medicine to the patients
All I can say is good gracious
You thought I be flippin' chickens and I'm stirrin' gravy
Look at me now all you can say is good gracious (good gracious)
You thought I would be locked down, modern day slavery (locked down)
Just look at me now all you can say is good gracious
