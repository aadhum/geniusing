I’m thinking elevated, smoking medicated
Drinking medicated, we been living crazy
Dodging Billy Jeans
Anakin to Vader
All for the dream, from the block to Fader
We ain’t say we famous, we just seeing paper
I don’t know where my comp is, no trace of my PC
just and aim and squeeze and watch the rest happen
Same tactics when I started rapping, I was still trapping, capping, finding whoops
master
she eat cock like coke backwards
When I stroke slow she cum faster, that’s pussy paces
But she let my gang fuck, straight A’s for participation
OG Mac cause I earned that, young Phil but my skin black
Been trill but this a mixed track, and Mac will like Mike did
I was road running when I didn’t rap
now this tour bus is my new trap
Logic pro is my new stove
Soundcloud is my new scale
People say that I’m arrogant, that’s fear in them if I do tell
I’m thinking elevated, smoking medicated
Drinking medicated, we been living crazy
Dodging Billy Jeans
and the Anakin to Vader
All for the dream, from the block to Fader
We ain’t say we famous, we just seeing paper
