Life so lavish you can’t pay for it
Sirens in the beat make ya grab the blammer
More obsessed with grams fuck the proper grammar
Over 9000 when he checked the scouter
I’m just a young nigga wielding all this power
Golden Road no El darado
I'ma start off sayin' sorry
But really I'm not, and you really should shop
With someone who shops with me
Cause there's levels to this and I'm sittin' on top
If you want home improvement, go and call for Tim
Pitchfork and that big C
