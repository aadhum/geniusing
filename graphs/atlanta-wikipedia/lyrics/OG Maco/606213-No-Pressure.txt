truthfully most of these niggas fraud
Pancake hundreds, stacking, I hop on planes for the nachos
Up here plotting on extra leg room
Plotting on a few estates
Bet I get my acreage up, taking care of home first
Then I build my haters up, equal opportunity
If it’s some for you, it’s more for me
Tell em how it’s supposed to be
Direct, not metaphorically
Forgi’s on McLaren feet, I see it when I go to sleep
I eat my pain along with steak and lobster tail
This that duck shit, what they really want from a nigga?
Just some dumb shit, dirty gun, wrong place shit
Reaching for your wallet, gun in face shit
I’m praying to god while I’m rapping, I make shit [?]
Baby bounce that ass till I’m soft
Type of nigga who don’t look at costs
Pancake hundreds, stacking, I hop on planes for the nachos
Up here plotting on extra leg room
Pancake hundreds, stacking, I hop on planes for the nachos
Up here plotting on extra leg room
