Life is like the ocean if I call it how I see cause
Ainâ€™t no one to save you when the situation deep
Better learn to float, never drop your head
Just rest your chin on your hopes
Stop counting your failures and learn to focus on your growth
Try a new approach, achieve another goal
Never be a coward because fortune favors the bold
Through my heart pumps the same blood that lions bleeding
No job, hustling, but I got anything you want
Bitch I got anything, bitch I got anything you want
Ho we got anything you want
