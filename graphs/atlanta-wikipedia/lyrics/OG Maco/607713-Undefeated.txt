These niggas keep on asking, these bitches keep on guessing
See these niggas hating, see these niggas faking
That ain’t how you do it, bitch you gotta prove it
My main bitch just got a bitch, damn bitch, ain’t that bout a bitch
Bitches running game while I mix Hennessey and Gatorade by the bench
My main lady lost some booty weight, told her come back to me when she not as thin
Midway Package getting so expensive
Lucky ass straight got some quotas in it
Niggas popping and they know they’re sinning
Ride the shotty girl with nappy papi
Head on the yacht would make the captain happy
Sex my fashion, I’m a dapper daddy
Only pageant baddies in the paddywagon
I might pull over, fuck a bitch in fuckin traffic
OGG, this shit is fucking tragic
Pull them niggas corpse up out the fucking casket
Then re-body bag them just to put them back in
Stripper [?],
pot full with gold
, [?] killing Manziel Kennedy
Ripple ripple now we start the wave
Trickle down how you getting paid, that’s a damn shame
How you bossing with no dossier
we been bossing niggas every play
Going for it when it’s fourth and 8, first 48, now the record’s straight
Tell them niggas we gon regulate, tell them niggas we gon regulate
Tell them niggas that it’s all ours but them fuck niggas they gon still hate
