We right back where we started
Right here in the darkness, in black
My new Margielas marble
lookin' straight out of Marvel
And that's past disgusting
I'm ballin' like 2K and Live, the sliders is up
The game set on pro, I post up the comp'
Now the table's loaded and no one's invited
We've been shackled, grappled, body weak as ours
Y'all ain't sick and tired, y'all still uninspired
Shit I'll conspire, aim for somethin' higher
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
We just saw some victims up in front of tyrants
Gettin' sprayed by hydrants cause we so defiant
Middle fingers up, we will not comply
Let 'em say the lies and answer with the silence
They just want confinements, they just want indictments
They know we're the diamonds, we forever vibrant
Let's destroy the system, I demand a riot
Let's destroy the system, I demand a riot
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
We just saw some victims up in front of tyrants
Gettin' sprayed by hydrants cause we so defiant
Middle fingers up, we will not comply
I demand a riot
I demand a riot
My people lost and tryna map the future
With a moral compass,
I'm just bein' honest
Where the promised land?
Can we treat Tyesha like they're treatin' Katy?
Brenda's still around?
[?]
Underfunded treated like a fungus
They call us niggas, take our culture from us
Gotta deal with Iggys and the Macklemores
Black girls was twerkin', they was screamin', "whores"
But Miley did it and she got a tour
Let's all say fuck it, go and start a riot
