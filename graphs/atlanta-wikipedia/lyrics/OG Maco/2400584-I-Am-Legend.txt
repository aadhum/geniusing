I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
Niggas act like they can't hear it
They can't see it, fake Helen Keller
I'm here now, it's fear now
Who the fuck is my peers now?
Know it ain't these young niggas
Just mumblin', ain't sayin' much
Lookin' back on what I came from
It's no surprise what I've come to
I'm Anakin, no skywalkers
Chains on me, I slave different
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
All of this for my dreams, nigga
I am legend if nothing else
Got me feelin' like King, nigga
