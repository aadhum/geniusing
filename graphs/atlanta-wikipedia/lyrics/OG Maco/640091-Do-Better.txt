The world been unforgiving so it's fitting that we are
It's hopeless souls who're gifted but won't make it off that block
And mothers know to tell their sons be wary of the cops
the picket fence was never ours
Life is like a box of chocolates but these bastards spit in ours
Crackers kill in cold blood, they just let Darren Wilson walk
If we go grab kalashnikovs, we're savage brutes, they'll pick us off
Trayvon couldn't have a hoodie on
Lil' Tamir was only 12 when they killed him November 22nd
Cameron Tillman, Sean Bell
This ain't nothin' new to us
New Emmett Tills, you know the drill
They're lynchin' still, just usin' guns
The biggest threat is our brown skin
With mouths filled and worth somethin'
All these rich niggas in the world still
I won't play the hype and just blame whites
We gotta build somethin'
Yeah I know we've been thuggin'
But that shit is why we've been strugglin'
The drug is life, fuck pills, homie
Have you ever even left your hood?
What's good, you need a trip don't you?
You don't want a 9 to 5
Make a plan and fortify
Of being court and all mortified
They hand the sentence that's big as shit
You won't see the light 'til you're 65
Just win, my nigga
It takes plenty focus and equal drive
You gotta dig, fuck pity
And my city love the semi
Hate is auto when you're so far ahead they just gotta follow
I got this firearm, I will come behead 'em
Big headed, my mind like Mandark in Dexter
But he can't shine from them trenches
Sports weren't made for everybody
He spends his time on them bitches
Y'all don't understand so y'all can see it when you see the master plan, mothafucka
