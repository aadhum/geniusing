Money on my mind, lethal weapon on me
We just kicking shit, thugging with my homies
Bitch we been thugging, bitch we been thugging
Bitch we been thugging, bitch we been thugging
Bitch you been hustling, making money
Money counter going (ooh, look at the money)
Tryna get a yacht, cruise the ocean
Bunch of young niggas coming out the slums hundred round
Been listening to Thug, we all came from nothing
We came from the slums, bitch you been drumming
Barum bum bum bum
In the bluff, with the strap, I ainâ€™t by myself
Money on my mind, lethal weapon on me
Bitch you eat like Shoney's
