I feel like I'm dying just from living
Okay, I go get it that's for my children
And I don't really know just how we winning
But fuck it, we winning, nigga we getting it
Sat in a cell by myself
I'm just thinking 'bout a black coupe
Cause it wasn't love in the city
Now it's just love in the city
I'm getting coached by a God
I'm on approach, I'm like God
I feel like I'm dying just from living
They been blowing like a whale
I feel like I'm dying just from living
