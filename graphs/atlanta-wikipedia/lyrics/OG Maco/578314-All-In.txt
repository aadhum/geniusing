We don't care what the rules say
We just gotta win
When we playing for keeps
All I know is a map to the motherfucking paper
If I told you, you would probably have jewels in your hand
Neck, wrist (?) buying mueller's and shit
Just ask your bitch
And don't be mad when she dodging and shit
Like why you ask?
They doing them, I'm doing I
Stayed in my lane and kept burning my tithes
You can find me in the cut in the back
With a beautiful woman, couple of tats
Pussy so good make my soul relax
DA never play fair, Zimmerman just got off
Trayvon would have got the chair
Niggas know it if you don't
You can beat yourself like Sosa
Or you can beat the odds like HOVA
