If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah
If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah
Even if we have these salty crackers killin' us
Forget Phil, we gon' make sure they remember us
Remember titans got caged, happened to the greatest
Just be patient, if we pace it we can run the world
We can build a safe haven for our little girls
Before they turn into the women with the vicious curves
If you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us
So if you feel alive, put your hands up
If you don't want to die, put your hands up
Don't shoot, this a black man anthem
We all human but they still don't understand us, yeah
