And I ain't got beef, 'less its bread on my head don't mistake the situation
Put in work, did vacation, pouring out
Liquor for my niggas lord knows that they should've made it
And I don't like niggas screaming "Live life" when you living life like a pussy
Fuck a hater nigga man I never seen them niggas cause they never seen nothing
Now its love in the city, where the love in the city?
Motherfucker, we don't owe you
Motherfucker, we don't owe you
Bitch wiggle, we don't know you
TRAP buckets on
O-G-G, man they shining
