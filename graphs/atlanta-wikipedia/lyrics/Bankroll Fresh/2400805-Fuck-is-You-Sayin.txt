I'm the boss man nigga I don't take pay cuts
Junkies at the backdoor asking for a wake up
I'm the real deal all these fuck niggas fake-a's
I don't wanna hear the trap story that ya made up
Straight up out the street nigga you know what I'm made of
458 with the bag nigga pay up
Don't try that fuck shit get ya ass sprayed up
Nigga talkin' money but these niggas ain't made enough
Put some floatas on the donk they was made to skate
