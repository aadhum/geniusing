I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
I'm a real trapper, I do what I wanna
Been on the table, eight ball in the corner
Just bought the Beamer, bought lean on the corner
All of this money got it from the corner
im put past the ploppin
unplugged in the socket
Thoughts of this shit
Want a ho who cook it
Hundred grands need stackin
But sit down you rappers
bought lean
