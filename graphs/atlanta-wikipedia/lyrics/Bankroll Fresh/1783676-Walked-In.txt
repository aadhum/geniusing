Looking like a trapper when I walked in the building
That mean I got something expensive
All these hoes I’m killin’
Nigga came from dope dealing
And I’m trying to grind up on a million
MAC got extension
Bank too big
Need pockets like Girbaud
No, bet you can’t do it like this
Fully loaded diamond on both of my wrists
Me and Joblow  gon’ scheme on your bitch
Allen Temple, nigga, get money out the six
My trap look like casper
I walked in
Throwing to the ceiling
Looking like a muthafucking Gotti
Ace of Spades poppin'
These bitches want to do doggie style
I got one Black and I got one Chinese
She be talking to me she say, “kung pow!”
Smokin’ this shit up, I made a cloud
yo ass musty
bar of dial
black & mild
All of my shit exclusive
Walked in this bih looking like Frank Lucas
Clip like a god damn ruler
Get her on molly she be actin’ slutty
Hit from the back, and she ate her buddy
Know my friends, they’re killin’
