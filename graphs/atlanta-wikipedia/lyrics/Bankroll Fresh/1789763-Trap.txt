I'm laughing at these sucker ass niggas
Black Medusa shades
Everybody ski'd up like we 'bout to shoot the stage
Everybody working, everybody getting paid
All these hoes fucking, all these hoes getting slayed
Young trap nigga, soon I'ma get a maid
I used to have roaches in my cereal, I couldn't eat
Straight up out that gutta, straight up out that gutta nigga
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fucking trap
I don't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen

All we do is trap, all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fucking trap
I don't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen
Stayed down to get it, grinded from a fifty
Used to use the razor, cut it down the middle, use to shave the edges, make sure he get 'em
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fucking trap
I don't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen

All we do is trap, all we do is trap
All we do is trap, all we do is trap
I wouldn't be where I was at if I didn't fucking trap
I don't leave a trap, I stay down just to make it happen
