Ran through the bags told my man to bring more
Pull up in a new ship, after one time I'm bored
Chrome Heart that's for me
On the floor baby she already bout to bring more
I'm the boss, boss man I 'OK' a little more
Ran out of mids, I need some more 'bows
Scraping the bowl, scraping up O's
Man them whole O's, man them hoes drove
Just a few more and he belong in the sky
Everything gotta go just to go get more
