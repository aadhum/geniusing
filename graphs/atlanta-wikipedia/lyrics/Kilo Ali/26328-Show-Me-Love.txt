I flow like a butterfly and sting like a bee
And you know this MAN
Cut up cut up in the dish
I rap too the fans, makin' that cash
So dont give me no hastle
For I'm the king of the castle
And a reign supreme
You who am I?......Kilo the dream
That's right ha ha
That's it ha ha
Some times a brother trip
Say I, I make that pussy hurt
I put my dick on the side of her drawz
