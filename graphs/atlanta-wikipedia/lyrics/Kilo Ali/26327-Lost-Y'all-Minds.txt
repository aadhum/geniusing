Drug dealers ain't nothin but trouble
Do the crime, you gotta pay the price
What you gonna tell Jesus Christ
He don't smoke, and he don't get high
Where the kingpins go after they die?
Cause it's a sin to sell
Brother you can go to jail, you can go to hell
What about a brother be thinking he a pimp though
Will he call his own mother a trick ho?
Or his cousin, or his sister, or his auntie
Boy, you better learn to love the ladies
