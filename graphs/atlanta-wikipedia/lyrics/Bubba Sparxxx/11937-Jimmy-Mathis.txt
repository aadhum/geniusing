I'm all about the green man
to hell with this white shit
Some cardiac arrest, so sweet with a dub taste
Through the years and the tears, the blood and the sweat
But if you ever believe, it's time to double your bet
Cause I ain't even tapped into half my potential
But I have shown growth though, and that is essential
We take it to the water and yo' ship'll get sunk
