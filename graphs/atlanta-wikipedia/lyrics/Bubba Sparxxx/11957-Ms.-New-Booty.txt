[Mr. Collipark]
I found you, Ms. New Booty
Hit the player's club for bout a month or two
Put a cat on it then see what it do
I found you, Ms. New Booty
Put a tan on it then see what it do
Girl I don't need you, but you need me
Take it off, let it flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories
And you ain't gotta sell sex, girl it sell itself
Like nuttin' else, yeah I'm a country boy
But that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Here go the whisper song,
Sippin' on Patron, blub blub blub
Ass get to jiggling, motherfuckin' wiggling
Keep that thang shakin' like she frostbit shivering
Ass be delivering all type of flashes
Cashes got these ho's shaking like molasses
Sssh *whispering* let me whisper in your ear
But that wasn't in just a minute ago
I guarantee you will make all the dough
So go and do your thang baby work what you got
And get what you want, make that money, don't let it make you
Put a cat on it then see what it do
I once was a breast man,
Your chest is just whatever, I found the buried treasure
