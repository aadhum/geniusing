I left yesterday, and I headed straight, up 78, to the A-T-L
These record sales done paid me well, so I'm smoking good, can't you smell?
Life is hell, till you drop a gem,
now Bubba got hoes, jocking him
Not cuz he cute, cuz he got that loot, wear Polo suits, and that's hot to them
tryin' to switch from Beam to Hennessey
But you know I can't, so give me Jimmy
And sit right down till the bottles empty
I'm certain to, attract a virus, cuz using rubbers, don't excite us
