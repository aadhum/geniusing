Catch me on a, backroad, or cookin in your momma's house
Me and Bubba know what the hell we talkin 'bout
Pickin up Betty's like they was beans and brussel sprouts
We got the clout to make you down this pickle
While you work the back bit Timbaland work the middle
Uh-oh, uh-oh! I see ya see ya smile
Uh-oh, uh-oh! Down comes your blouse
Timb' been around 'em all
From white to black, even magnoli-all
To hit 'em in project halls
In back of the streets maybe right in front of y'all (ha ha ha)
Timb' and Bubba is a problem y'all
It's like hip-hop, meets effin Tim McGraw
Bench lumber logs just to work the chest
