I can't forget the bumps on the road to Hartsville
Andy's scared to fly, but surely Bubba Sparxxx will
Shit and I ain't slept, in a month of Sundays
Still I'm wide awake as we coast out on the runway
And now the captain says I'm number one for take off
But Timmy I'm too weak all this starvin led to weight loss
Fear turns to adrenaline as life accelerates
I'm headed to my destiny, how long you guess it takes - to get there?

The in flight movie today is "Gladiator"
But I can't afford the headphones, it's cool, I'll catch it later
I'm cramped between two dudes, one from each coast
Yet we all agree a safe flight is what we need most
Now they fin' to serve the meal, I think I'll go with steak
Every fuckin choice is crucial and we all know the breaks, in this game
When this journey is complete, you'll know by my reaction
Tears of jubilation as I'm landin back in Athens - thank you Lord
