The world is cold as a winter
And people gonna get up under your skin like a splinter
I got a whole lot of issues that are unresolved
I went 2 weeks without seeing nobody, just my dog
His name is Blao, he's the closest thing to a child
Relapse is a record
Marshall Mathers

Iâ€™m talking deadly habits
I tried my best to be so good to some folks
The same people showed me betrayal up close
where I come from
