Paid homage for three days been written the past eight
I feel I'm the last great warrior of written lyric
If its Bubba spittin fear it, this that shit legends made of
It'll take more than a flag for them folks to segregate us
Hook it, let it cake up prepare it for whole sale
This my mother fuckin heart I dont care if it dont sell
Dammit I guess its hopless, y'all just won't listen
When I'm rhymin to provide you with diamond that dont glisten
You content with moving units, I'm faced with a worse plight
To give you a verse like, that first hit of extascy
Yeah you special in your click but you ain't shit up next to me
Shit these boys dont really want it, the just mumblin to be heard
Took a rich prissy bitch and played her this and made her gutta'
I bet y'all never seen one of me look so clean
Im through noddin my head to shit, thats anythin but monumental
From my road to your trap, my code is no dap
If your head is like a keg, chillin ice cold with no tap
I'll sleep when I in the dirt
