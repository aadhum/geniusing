The country boy done got 'em shook like Randy Moss and Jason
Perhaps all Bubba's numerals don't fit in y'alls equation
If yo' opinions coincide with that, you oughta save 'em
a myriad
Of Satan's substance is in my system, still my wisdom
Is never once compromised, that's between God and I
Never once forgotten my manners cuz my mama
Played in public housin, Opelika, Alabama
But she had a different plan for me, and Russ and Ginger
Thank the Lord for Jimmy Mathis Pops they must remember
How you held it down when them other clowns disappeared
Or to catch the fish you bait the hook with little Dylan's poo poo
Love some Jimmy Carter, but we never ever voted
But slum is still slum, so you best believe we toted
Every firearm from AKs to thirty-thirties
And from live rocks to livestock, they pays the early birdy
Thus we worked the land like you worked the block with yayo
But I chose keys over cattle cuz the profits way mo'
Might get locked away though, peddlin' them snow cones
So we keep it simplified with acres of that homegrown
Plus the finest shine that you could find this side of Memphis
It all comes down to this, one last chance to advance
The worlds weight plus a ton restin on my shoulders
Cuz Eminem's incredible, but then I really have to say this
For y'all to leave my soul at rest and add me to yo' play list
