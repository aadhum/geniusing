I know that I ain't gunna be happy with nobody else, I'd rather live my life alone
I guess I live my life alone
Born alone
Life live, die alone
Fall in love, break-up cry alone
I lie alone
In bed by myself
I might as well
Break up outta here
Invite her here
Blank out kill the bitch
And go to jail
I don't give a shit
This empty house, I can't live in it
So I put you out my misery
This how I feel, until she right here with me
And then I tell her, look at what you did to me
Get down and beg her, to stay right here with me
Because the pain too severe for me
I said the pains too severe for me
