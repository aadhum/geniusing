Y’all and us I’mma tell you what the difference is
See, we old school, you just old news
We used to move blow, and you just blow dude
See we the talk of the town, me and my whole crew
You run around town, gossip like the hoes do
We get them lames out our section like we 'posed to
Don’t call it a comeback
Again ride Benz from the fed pen
Pull up on them suckers, pop the trunk and tell ‘em get in
Hoes want their clothes back, listen up fagbait
At stores asking for the same size the bitches buy
They say it's hip, but where I'm from we call it sissyfied
Before us there were none, after us no more there'll ever be
This the greatest show on Earth you ever see
Blowing money like my nigga, Big Meech used to do it
Say we’re blowing money fast,
big old money bag
Three, four hundred cash just to make them suckers mad
Been the best since I was rapping in the rattle
A true don, three piece cashmere suit on
