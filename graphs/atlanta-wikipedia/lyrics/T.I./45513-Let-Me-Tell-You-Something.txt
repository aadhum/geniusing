(First he can't be my man, now he want to be my man)
Different chicks running in and out the crib like this
Maybe five, maybe six, seven, eight'll be enough
Plus the twins make ten but for you I give it up
purple label
So what if I got a pass, labelled a dirt bag
By the minute, hearts I broken and women I hurt bad
Christian Dior
fur jackets
its hard to stop starin
Then
I'mma
relates
ya
I'm followin' mine
eleven karat pink stones
