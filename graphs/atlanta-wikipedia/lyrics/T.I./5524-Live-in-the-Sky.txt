I'd like to dedicate this song to anybody who done ever lost somebody
To the grave, to the streets, to the jail cell...
I feel the only thing I ain't done yet is die, you know?
Life's ups and downs they come and go
All my folk who ain't alive, I hope they live in the sky
It's true what goes around, comes back you know
Give a damn what he done, that's my muhfuckin folk
And I love that nigga to death, no muhfuckin joke
can feel my eyes fillin
Taught me I ain't have to incorporate yay in my business
Coincidentally, that's why today you not wit me
My cousin died over some yay, and I miss him
Plus he at his family house, let's say she the eye witness
But her boyfriend did the shootin, judge gave a life sentence
now I'm dressed up in all black
Jamel
Guess ya death was a lesson in life, it taught me that
Know they say a nigga go to jail and sleep til day 2
Well that's how sick I was when Jay-Ru
Found out the hard way, that when powder that they were tootin
Overdose on heroin, died at 22
If you ain't heard about your daughter, she smile just like you
So cute, even resorts to violence like you
You know your baby momma loose, but ha, what can you do
And I got 4 myself, yuh, it's been a few
Now everything I do is for King, Messiah, Daysia, Demani
Tell the Lord they all I've got, so please don't take them from me
From me standin in the trap, with carryin this here cap
Laughin at the niggas who serve with no strap
Tell them niggas, man, y'all trippin with no maps
Get robbed, and thats the part of my pistol ain't no help
Me, you, the crew just fell out over dough and a lil crack
Never could apologize, you died, that's why they say that
I bet you niggas think I'm livin it up
Til you see polices laughin as they pickin me up
Went from seeing how many bitches I could fit in the truck
To three hots and a cot, is you kiddin or what?
Fuck how many millions I got, nigga, so what if I'm hot
When I got prices on my head, feds rushin my spot
A million haters want me dead, forced to carry a gat
"But you's a seven-time felon, what you doin wit that?"
It's a Catch-22, either you lose or you lose
That's the way the game structured, for real, niggas to suffer
And I ain't neva been a buster, always stood on my feet
Like a man prepared to take whatever coming for me
A pussy nigga or polices with a warrant for me
I'm a G, prepared to die for what's important to me
Look anybody in the eye who say he want it wit me
Put up the house and bet the odds if it's comin' from me
Ol G's say I need to learn to be patient
You telling me with these seven years of probation
Pistol charges and a host of other open cases
If niggas only knew the kind of time I was facin'
I try to keep it to myself, but sometimes I couldn't take it
Got four kids, the smiles on they faces
Mean more to me than my crown and my bracelet
Take that away from me, and my life is butt naked
???
