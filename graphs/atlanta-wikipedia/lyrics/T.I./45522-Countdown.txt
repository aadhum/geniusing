Ay, what it is, the king back in the buildin'
Still stackin' and buildin', you still rappin' to children
My lifestyle's urban, never met me in person
Just my bread suburban, in a red suburban
I'm shell-shocked, black eye, like I been in the service
Fuck you niggas, Dominique slam dunk you
I was being nice at first, now I'm runnin' through niggas
Whole crews, not just one or two niggas
The reason why D.J.'s ain't have a clue I was fabulous
Comin' live from the Terra-Dome
And your disc ain't shit unless the click ride to it
And I'mma show you how the Westside do it
In the A, not Cali, bank heads, (???) valley
Cuz I been sellin' yeh since I was Bow Wow's age nigga
