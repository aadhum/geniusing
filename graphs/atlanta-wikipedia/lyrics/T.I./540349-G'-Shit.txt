I'm a rich nigga like I don't know
I can change if I wanna, but I won't though
Steer right even when I'm on the wrong road
Real talk from the heart what I'm known for
Skinny jeans, I don't do those
I'm the starter sub-par oughta shoot for
Fully automatic chopper, you could shoot though
Now I'm movin' five mil' when I shoot dough
Audemar, Hublot
One point five on the two-do'
Old hustle, new flow
Old money,
Long as I'm around, fuck they need you for?
Ridin' in the Chevy totin' three bricks
Since nobody wanna make G shit
This is for the gangsters, for the pimps and hoes
This is for the dope boy trappers sellin' halves and hoes
(Since nobody wanna make G shit)
They want G shit, give it to 'em, give it to 'em now
They want G shit, give it to 'em, I'm the one to give it to 'em
If you don't know me let me tell you somethin', shawty
Still got them choppers, make you run from it
Camouflage, dog tag
Got 'em followin', when you see me better haul ass
Keep it G at all costs, what you call that?
Crack rock, hip hop, I done all that
Certified trap nigga
All left field,
Keep speakin' for the ones who ain't got a voice
Kill 'em dead only when they leave no other choice
How I see it, if you ain't down to die 'bout it
Don't waste my time, slime, why the fuck we talking about it?
Still ridin' in the Chevy
Now what the fuck is an ounce? We smokin' bout an LB
And I'ma take this shit to trial, they got nothin' on me
I got a bag full of birds
When Jay was beefin' with Nas, I was sellin' cocaine
When Game was beefin' with 50, I was doin' the same thing
I was at the hospital, nigga, Meechy got shot
