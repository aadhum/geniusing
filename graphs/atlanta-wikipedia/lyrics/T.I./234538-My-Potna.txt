You got a problem, you can get it how you live, pussy nigga
You ain't bout that life, you just be actin hard, pussy nigga
Hey when they walk up on me 'Man, what it is, my potna?'
I say nuthin' but Bankhead and Center Hill, my potna
Didn't believe us when we said 'They tried to kill my potna.'
That's why he doin' life, but he still my potna
Ask Snoop, I'm the truth, like Trae, my potna
C-Dub, KT, yes they my potnas yo
Young Dro, Mac Boney, Big Kuntry, my potnas

My cousin Toot was the man, he got his work 'round the base
