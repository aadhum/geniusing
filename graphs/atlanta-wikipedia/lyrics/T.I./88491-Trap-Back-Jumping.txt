I show you how to move a lot of blow
Hey, nigga who you know that's hot as this
Drop that water out off that pot
Let it boil up and get high
Then whip it good with your wrist like that
Thats how you triple every brick you get
Catch a nigga coming out of the DOA
Hit 'em with the chopper leave 'em DOA
You can play with niggas, not me, okay?
Them other niggas suckers, I’m a G, okay?
T.I. K.I.N.G., okay?
You keep trap shit when I feel like
Them dope boys know what I live like
Dineros off kilos
Of oz's makes zeros, here we go
It’s time to put that work back in the stash box
Put that rent-a-car on that slab
Hit that highway from bout five day then come back and get cash
Got halves, quarters and whole things
Chevrolets and them gold things
Got Rolex, got Benzes, and it's all off of that cocaine
It’s cold game but it’s cool though
Work get gone and I move blow
Your shit hot, oh yeah bro, that shit drop won’t sell much
Platinum all in my wall dawg,
crib big it like a mall dawg
My house worth your whole life,
your condo's my old ice
You niggas barely in first class, I charter G4 flights
Can’t tell me shit, homie
Down here I’m good as it get, homie
Ain't nobody got shit on me
I’m a little nigga, but I’m big homie
I’m big homie , do big shit
No World Cup, I kick shit
Ride foreign, but don’t forget
I’m back trapping, got more bricks
It's time to get them pre-paids and them metros
Over here we got big
Got Actavis if you sipping lean
Prescription pills and Molly
Even got Heroin if you 'bout it
Shawty my shop open up all night
Don't like me, that's alright
Come fight me, nigga, yeah right
And nigga get wrong and getting dead right
Get your ass, ho
Get embarrassed, ho
All about my cash flow
Your new bitch was my last ho
Nigga try me, I think not
My temper bad, I might blank out
Bust a nigga before I can even think about
What I got to lose if he bust a move
Well, I got to do what I got to do
Trap rolling, bumping, always selling something
You got it if you want it and whatever for the money
On my grind, they in line for the product from the dime up
They know where to find him
do you know what it time for
