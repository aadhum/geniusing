[Intro]
R-E-S-P-E-C-T, M-Y, H-U-S-T-L-E
I ain't in it for the fame, I ain't in it for the glory
I'm down to die for it, absolutely mandatory
AY!
These niggas bitch-made, I'm gettin paid six ways
Six laid, shit's sprayed with lemonade with blades
Keep your mouth closed, you don't wanna get sprayed
Shoot you up your body, let it sunbathe six days
Kamikaze renegade, nah he never been afraid
Kept the trap hot enough to fry an egg in the shade
I ball 'til the day I'm lyin dead in the grave
I leave the Feds behind the wall cause I ain't get away
Chopper round the corner and a bushel with a brick of yay
A bust can happen any day, we out here trappin anyway
Gettin money's an addiction, damn what a nigga say?
I got a real bad condition if I ain't gettin paid
I know you see this car I drive and see the house that I live in
And figure this is enough (what nigga?) I want way mo'
you set your sights way low
Had enough of the game, I don't know whether to stay or go
And different group of lames and suckas e'rywhere which way I go
I said I wear a crown, not a halo - sorry
Ay, don't you think you been pullin gats fussin cussin enough?
Round here braggin 'bout these niggas you be bustin enough
Man look around, ain't nobody sufferin but her
You could beat a hundred cases, catch one and you fucked
Is you crazy? Pull a gun in the club
See how many folks and polices put you down in the club
Won the Grammy's (but not the one that I wanted)
