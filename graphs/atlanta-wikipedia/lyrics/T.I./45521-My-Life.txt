A-town veteran, started at 11
Went and bought an 8-ball, I was stayin' down ever since
That's why it's hard to find a young rap nigga better then
The Bankhead resident,
Heart of a lion and the nuts of an elephant
"Trap Muzik" heaven sent, you hatin' and it's evident
You tryna stack presidents, I'm tryna set precedents
The comparisons insultin' my intelligence
Cuz real recognize real, and real you ain't never been
My patnas tellin' me "shawty ya have to chill"
Haters see the Spider and they wanna put a slug in it
"All Eyez on Me" with my Westside homie
