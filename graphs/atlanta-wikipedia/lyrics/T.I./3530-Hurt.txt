[Intro]
Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba
You pussy niggas finna make me kill one a y'all
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Betta tell 'em I ain't playin'
Because it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Ain't a damn thang change
I still keep that thang right up under my shirt
Run up on him where he hang and BANG!
Cause it's all fun and games until somebody get hurt
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Boy you finna get hurt, murked, put him in the dirt
Boy you betta catch me first
Alota pussy niggas talk like broads love runnin' they mouth
That is til I run in they house
Put the gun in they mouth, tell 'em "Nigga talk shit now"
You'd think they know the gun go BOW!
I ain't scared of the law
Naw I'm about to go to war what it is nigga win lose or draw
I'll never get caught murkin' y'all cuz it ain't what you do
The question is: Who saw?
Shawty I'm way too raw
Catch me any day you want you could think I'm a play if you want
But the fact still remain if I got a AK and you don't
Well then playa you gone
Don't get me wrong there's some niggas wanna kill me too (Well where they at?)
But this ain't bout shit cause it's well known where I'm at
They could catch me in the booth right now if you really like that
Or a plastic bag holdin' yo' shit
Leave 6 in you, a couple more in ya bitch
And I don't miss cause I'm focused nigga
[Verse 2: Alfa Mega
I'm finna ride homie
Fuck niggas might talk loud, act real, but they don't really want this here
Pussy niggas betta act right, lay low, we know where ya family live
Trust me you don't want me up in ya crib with a ski mask on duck tapin' ya kids
You can pray all you want but I don't forgive
Fifty at the front door, fifty at the back
Half got K's, half got Macs
Bring 'em out, bring em out, show me where he at
Lights out, no hasta ma√±ana, hasta la vista, sayonara
Right now I'mma give you somethin' that a make a nigga beg "Please"
When I go to Jacob and cop that ring
The nigga ride inside the truck with me (and) for the most part the nigga stuck with me
