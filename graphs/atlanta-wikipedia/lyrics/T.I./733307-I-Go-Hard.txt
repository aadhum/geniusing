See me running down the electric boulevard
Get up out of my face before the problem starts
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard
a
100 street
Put all the jewelry in the bag with the bankroll
Or else your momma gon' be mourning like Alonzo
See me running down the electric boulevard
Get up out of my face before the problem starts
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard
Trap certified, shawty ask somebody
Oh you winning fights? I’m used to winning war, come on with it
Yeah, ay, keep playing round with it
Throw you down and I stand up to the [?] with the gun, I did it
Look, and I ain’t bullshitting
Respect when I look in the eyes of a man
See me running down the electric boulevard
Get up out of my face before the problem starts
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard
Keep it cool in the field when the shot fly by me like
But you pussy ass niggas ain’t hard to me, c’mon
See me running down the electric boulevard
Get up out of my face before the problem starts
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard
See me running down the electric boulevard
Get up out of my face before the problem starts
If you want to act tough then meet me in the yard
