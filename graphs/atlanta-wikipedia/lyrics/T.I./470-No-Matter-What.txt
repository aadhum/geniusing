A more divine southern rapper
with a swagga like mine
Believe me, pain's a small thang to a giant
Ali said even the greatest gotta suffer sometime
So I huff and puff rhymes
how to get get get it
So you up and coming rappers wanna diss, just kill it
I'm officially the realest, point blank, period
That's why the dope boys and the misfits feel it
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what people here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty
Rather see me in the cell
Instead of this new McLaren
Even when winning illogical, losing is still far from optional
But, when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do
Been locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song
[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty
Guess it was understood, for me it was over with
Go get a beat from Toomp
Before ya know it I'm back what it look like shorty
I lost my partner and my daughter in the same year
If your heart fill with faith then you can't fear
Wonder how I face years and I'm still chillin'
Easy, let go and let God deal with it
[Hook]
I ain't dead (nah), I ain't done (nah)
I ain't scared (of what), I ain't run (from who)
But still I stand (yeah)
No matter what pimpin' here I am
No matter what remember
I ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)
They hate me more (so?)
Yeah I know
Here I go
No matter what shorty, here I go
No matter what shorty
