Ladies And Gentleman I Apologize For The Confusion
See If You Recall Back Trap Muzik We Had This Problem Once Before
I Thought We Had This Shit Under Control Though You Know What I'm Saying?
Man Why Can't You Just Talk About What The F**Ks Wrong With You?
What The F**K, You Heard Me Say Nigga
Ya’ll Out Here Man, All On T.V, Man Flossing With Your Hollywood
Motha F**Kin Outfits And Shit. Bra I Ain't With This Shit Home Boy
[T.I.P.:]
Ya’ll Be Trying To Put Me On Front Of Every Motha F**Kin
Camera Lights
[T.I.P.:]
It Don't Want None Of That King Of The South Shit If It Wasn’t For Tip
Ya'll Can Kiss My Ass. You Can Tell Em I Said That. Fake Ass Niggas
Man I'm Done Talking To You.(Glass Breaks) Man, Just Go To The Next Song
F**K It Man
