Hey, what's happenin'?
It's been a minute, huh? I'm just hollerin'
How you doin?
Is this new nigga the real thing or is just a little fling?
He know what to do with the stuff that you stuff in them little jeans?
I just pick up the phone and call you every week or two
To let you know I miss you and see how that nigga treatin' you
[Hook: Governor King]
I remember morning, noon, and night I used to hold you tight
I know we used to fuss and fight
But I'm just calling to say, "Hello, hello baby"
See time has its own funny way of keeping us close
Even though we never stayed, together
I just wanted to say, "Hello, hello baby"
Hey, what's happenin'? How ya doin'? I know plenty of niggas pursuin'
