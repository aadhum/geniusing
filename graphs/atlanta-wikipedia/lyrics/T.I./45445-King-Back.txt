[Intro: Just Blaze]
And the prophecy read that
One day like the phoenix rose from the ashes
That a boy will be born unto a family in the slums
This boy will go on and use the knowledge that he gains
While fighting for survival in the streets
To become a great leader
And in time that boy will grow to become King!!!!!!
Time to ride nigga (Just Blaze!!)
I welcome you and get acquainted with the youngest in charge
Respected from East to West like he was running the mob
Dictating, ain't taking orders from no one but God
I know you niggas is broke cause I know what you charge
Them niggas wishing for a Phantom it's one in my garage
It's black as legary right next to the black Ferrari
You niggas ain't getting money off of rapping I'm sorry
Fuck the rep went and spent 60 large on a Harley
And pardon me I'm giving you the Westside story
Of the A, where I stay
niggas stay down for me
You want to play, have you gay niggas lay down for me
You reppin the A horribly
The king back!
Nigga the king back
You betta lean back
Nigga the king back

The king back!
Nigga the king back
Shawty you seen that?
Nigga the king back
You need to go back and grab I'm Serious you know
You need to get familiar with Dope Boyz and see where
All these niggas got they style
See where that trap shit came from
Then you need to graduate to mother fucking In Da Streets Vol.1-3
Then you need to go to Trap Muzik, I got locked up for a second
Then grab Urban Legend and now to bring you up to speed
Who knew you could fit on your wrist a whole pound of diamonds
I'm number one on the list while you clowns are climbing
If Jay handled the clay and around the time
You ain't ready for out here cause the lifestyle violent
Make us mad, get your ass wiped out like Thailand
Ay man I know y'all niggas still in the trap everyday
Still man I know y'all don't see nothing but the projects nothing but grits
But listen
Make no mother fucking mistake man
I still wiil shoot up my mother fucking self, AK and
45 nigga on side nigga
And come see 'bout niggas you understand
But I don't want to do that cause I respect that shit y'all doing
I started that shit
I made that shit cool
I made these niggas want to be you nigga
Nigga respect this shit!!!!
