Just keep going, and don’t look back
And look forward from where you’re at
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
Wave hello, hello, hello…
Push that pedal to the max
Count that money that’s in your lap
There’s some jealousy in your rearview
We survived yesterday, foreign ride connoisseurs
Popping fly today, tomorrow ain’t promised to us
Grind hard for dirty money but our heart’s pure
Get by theyself, they talking tough but don’t do nothing to us
Call themselves paper chasing, when wealth be running to us
Hustle Gang, King Team, label me the ring leader
Two heaters with me in the ride but I don’t need ‘em though
Left evil behind me, that’s where I plan to keep it, go
I hustle hard, forever shine, pay haters no never mind
Won’t stop until we popping bottles at the finish line
Can’t complain, I’m highly favored, my flavor’s god given
Praying as if for forgiveness, hoping God listen
As far as dissing me, pimping, go ahead and have a ball
Meanwhile I’m getting’ bread, determined to have it all
I’m talking money, sonny, if ain’t none of that involved
Why is we conversing? This vehicle ain’t reversing, go
