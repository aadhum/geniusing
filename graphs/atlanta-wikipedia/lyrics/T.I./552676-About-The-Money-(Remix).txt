I step up in this bitch like Moses
Damn right, motherfucker, Red Sea got departed
This is that "All About The Money" remix?
Well, I'ma kill a motherfucker before it even get started
That'll kill your ass like some Ebola
I swear my Rollie stay shining like a rainbow
You be shining like I sprayed you with some oil sheen
DC, Young Fly, now what the fuck you mean?
Young said he Seen It All, now what the fuck ya'll seen?
David Beckham, way I kick it like I'm playing hella soccer
I turn the valet to a helipad
Nigga straight walk up in the bitch like I'm Nino
From the coat on my back, to the shoes on my feet
Everything on me Valentino
Niggas still on my dick, what you a homo, nigga?
When you sayin' my name it's free promo, nigga
[Hook: T.I.]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
Turn it!
I'm in New York and I'm ballin' just like a Net though
I'm drinkin' bubblegum pink like Pepto
All my Zoe's
I'mma beast with the choppa, I'm the same without it
Graduated from the lean, that's my alma mater
Imma Shoot 'em in his head, he say look at my roof
No sticks, no seeds, only kush in my kush
Make a nigga commit suicide and call it a selfie
I get M's like mmm-mmmm-mmm
I'm an asshole, I'm full of myself
You get an asshole full of my foot
They find your ass in the woods when they look
And these hoes ain't as good as they look
I need to take my own advice though, cause if the pussy good then I'm good
Where your ghetto pass nigga, I been big since a little ass nigga
You little ass nigga, you don't get a pass nigga
Started as a middle class nigga
When I blew up, I ain't even hear the blast nigga
I was chillin', smokin' on the loud
Focused on the future, but I need my money now
Don't give me the runaround
Upstairs in my mansion, knock knock, "who's there?"
I ain't even comin' down if it ain't about the money
[Hook: T.I.]
If it ain't about the money
Don't be blowin' me up, nigga I ain't gettin' up
If it ain't about the money
Ain't no use in you ringin' my line, stop wastin' my time
If it ain't about the money
Nah I can't even hear what you say, I ain't finna do shit
If it ain't about the money
Bitch, you can miss me with it, bitch nigga miss me with it
Turn it!
I would love to spray your face with Olay, aye
Girl let's hit like Kobe and Ginobili
If them not Gucci earmuffs you can't ignore me
Uncle taught me say hasta luego - if it ainâ€™t about the money!
