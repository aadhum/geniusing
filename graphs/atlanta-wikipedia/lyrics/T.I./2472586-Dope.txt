[Intro: Aaliyah]
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now really close
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Ok)
Boy you really get me high
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Yeah, yeah) I feel like I’m on dope
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
(Uh, alright) Boy you really get me high
(Aye, aye, yeah)
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope, dope
There now hold me close
Anyway, D'Usse mixed with lemonade
Feeling good like I'm dealing ye
The jet ride 50 million, a wonderful feeling
Dre and Pharrell
Mixed with Eric B. and Rakim
They like to pop a seal, high enough to see Aaliyah
Boy you really get me high
[?]
I feel like I’m on dope
This winter shit got me high as a bitch
Dripping sauce kicking flavor, super fly with the shit
Don't need a gram to get laid, an ounce to get paid
Anyone know us, they know trap shit in our DNA
Dre
'Dam
Blowing gasoline to put my hat on lean
Where I stay all they say is “Fuck Trump”, all day
Two or three pistolero with me eh hombre
She brought an ‘O of kush to me and a six pack
Aye man, life ain't, life ain't like this for you, man?
I swear to God, you know you should pray more haha
Yeah, bankrolls on bankrolls, man, you dig?
