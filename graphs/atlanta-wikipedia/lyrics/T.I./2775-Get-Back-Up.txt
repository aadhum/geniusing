Yeah he go to work, never done no drugs up until the Fed

Hello, out there, I'm only human dawg
Can you, hear me? Can you, hear me? I'm only human dawg
It's an S.O.S
To let me, be me
Hello, out there, ay you can love me, or either leave me
Can you, hear me? Before you judge me, just let me be me
It's an S.O.S, ay you can love me, or either leave me
To let me, be me before you judge me, see life ain't easy
Hello, out there, yeah, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
Can you, hear me? I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
It's an S.O.S, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
To let me, be me, hmm, you gon' miss me when I'm gone
I know when I'm gone, I bet you gon' miss me when I'm gone
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
I accept full responsibility for all the wrong I've done

I apologise for being human man
But never again partner, you could put my life on that
