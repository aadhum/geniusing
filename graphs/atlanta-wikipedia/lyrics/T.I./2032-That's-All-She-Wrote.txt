Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
It's stupid how I go in
Knowin' everybody knowin' that I’m sewin' up the game
Destroying like they hate me for it
Others sworn under oath, or banished, left completely scorned
You tell lies, get cut, nigga, kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I’m the Jetsons, you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin', Prime Time
Like my new Air Yeezy’s, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off living life, you check to check reciting rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Terrible fate, not even a Slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed
Wait, Sarah, you're late
Your train left, Mascara and eggs smear in your face
Night's over, goodbye, ho! I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never should've came within range of my Rover
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind
hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola (Faygo's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pull 5 molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight-grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay-ass teddy-bear?
Bitch, you're already bi-polar
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
Still, I ball like there’s no tomorrow
The credit roll, the curtain close, the movie over with
But don’t get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Yeah, life is sure a bitch, but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pouring in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah ha, I’m paid never gon' be poor again
Never gon' see me toting anything, all you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah, I’m on another level, but you niggas still can get it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it, Tip?
Shirt off my back?
I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let 'em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't I'ma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wasting it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock I'm racing it, double timing it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
That it may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man, I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant
Well, I guess I’m wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs, you can get the F on, dawg
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
