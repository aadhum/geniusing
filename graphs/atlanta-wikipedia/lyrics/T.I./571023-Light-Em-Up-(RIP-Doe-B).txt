You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Tell me why it is now that we live only for the moment?
Now you gotta go to war with a nigga
Just because you got more than a nigga
Crabs in a barrel, in ghetto America
Goddamn shawty you were 'pose to make it
[Hook: Pharrell]
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it, huh

[Post-Hook: Pharrell]
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
You was supposed to make it
You was supposed to make it
Get your lighters up, lighters up
Get your lighters up, lighters up
You know when I met you, sitting in the car
Buckhead in the mall, you was something special
He was just a young nigga, still he never got excited
It was hard to overwhelm a fat nigga
With a eye patch, swingin' hard
Reppin' role tide Alabama
Made you Hustle Gang, let you in the family
Said "I get you rich" you said "you want a Grammy"
Actavis with candy
All you said was "Run it, book the flight I'm coming
'Fore I leave though, I gotta handle something"
I just said "okay", I hung up the phone
Couple hours later, damn my nigga gone
Supposed to be a living legend, hating nigga sent you home
