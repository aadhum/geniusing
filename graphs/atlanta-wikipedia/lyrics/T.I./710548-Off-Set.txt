Off-set
Car ain't even out yet
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Bankroll mafia
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
I'm finna bring the drama to your front doo
andale pronto
Turn up out through
Hey, black diamonds like a night
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Nigga havin' hoes, hoes, hoes sounding ill (main bitch)
Nigga, I'mma keep it trill
I could never tell, I'mma make bail
Bet that Coca Cola take away some of the pills
Make play [?]
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Difference between me and you
Is you shoot and I aim for the body bag
I'll make your head disappear like Malaysian Air)
Bit too long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
Automatic long clip, you know you ain't 'bout that
