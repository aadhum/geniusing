Yeah
For all my real ATL niggas, thatâ€™s right
This the dope boy anthem
Come on
Hook
Money, hoes, cars and clothes
That's how all my niggas roll
Blowing dro on 24's
That's how all my niggas roll
My partners looking at me to see if my eyes open
Flying down 285 but I'm focused
454 SS
Doing 'bout a hundred but the track still bumping
Number 8 on N.W.A, "Straight Outta Compton"
Pull up at your apartment sitting on 20 somethings
And the dope boys hollering "What's happening?"
kid running in
And the cars been parked but the rims keep moving
Sign pictures, buy an onion of good and throw the deuces
Cause I ain't Hollywood, I come from the hood, I'm used to it
I'm calling out shots like a pool shark
Lose your leg when I spray, end up dead from the K
yay'
I make 11 everyday
