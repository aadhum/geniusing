They know I'm rich, it don't matter
Bruh cause as fresh as I be
What she do for you you pay her
But she do for me for free
got them horses under my hood
Yea I'm ridin round in your side of town, and I'm blowin O's of that good
I bet Pimp C proud of me
I got the city lights in my rear view
Got a billion on my mirror, say could be closer than it appear to
Then it's back to the drop, hit the gas, burn the gas
Got purple stuff in my 20 ounce
Don't want me on your street with this clean paint and these white seats
