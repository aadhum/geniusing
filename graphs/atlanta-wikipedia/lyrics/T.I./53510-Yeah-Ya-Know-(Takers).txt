They got the game all wrong, it's too pretty in here
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
In the middle of a fight, I'm so cool
Everybody wonder how I go through
All of this half of which would have broke you
Came out smelling like a rose even more true
Cause I get it don't mean they do too
Cause I ain't got a damn minute ain't no 'tude
You know we never not goin all in
Kickin doors over just to let my dogs in
So many rides never catch a nigga walkin'
if you never seen tragic happen
NBA expansions
Way past respect you see,
but a nigga ain't even half as big as he finna be
I went from rolling wit' dem rocks on the block
To controlling my position at the top
Of every chart I will not, stop
In France, bonjour, merci, oui
The same people on tour, on TV
At the gates on the day I was released
The only time you will ever see me free
Atlantic records say just make another hit for me
I tell 'em cut a hundred million dollar check for me
I'm the king in a game like chess to me
Give the rest to the attendant puttin' gas in the jet for a homie friend
Now I gotta new Audemar with a blue face
Hoppin' up in G4 jet, no suitcase, whole new wardrobe in a new place
Change clothes if a stain on my shoelace
Bringin' homocide to the gang, no alibi
Can't tell a lie to the judge, I'm guilty
Your Honor do you mind the guy tried to kill me
But if they wonderin who runnin the A now?
Prison ain't change me, it made me worse
