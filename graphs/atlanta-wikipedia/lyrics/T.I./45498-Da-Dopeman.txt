Look at this little nigga, man
I'll show you how to tote that tool
Keep it leanin' to the left
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow to marijuana, know I got it if you want it
(From a ki' to a G, it's all about money)
Look, bet all you see is tats, money, grills, and chains
But if you scratch the surface you can feel the pain
Names change but the situation still the same
The bills need payin' nigga simple and plain
Take a young'n who's aspirin' to get him some change
Won't nobody hire him so he get in the game
Went and bought a 50 slab, divide it up into ten
Sold 'em all, double down, did it again
Throw some money to your momma keep some food in the house
Cop the outfit and the Jordans on the day they came out
Betta get ya self a pistol know the jackers is out
Time to get yourself a half
make sure it's some glass
A hundred bags sell it fast stack a G now you officially
(I betcha think you pretty good at it now, huh?)
Now once you flipped a couple o's know the game get gravy
Take twelve fifty go git ya two and a baby
Yeah sixty three grams if you whip that right
And if you snort blow, do it on your own time
brick
(Stay with me now shawty, here comes the fun part)
You caught a sale case down in Macon with your cousin
A mob of a hundred just a few of them true
You heard a worker snictchin' on you and it's true
Everybody know you sell that shit
The feds come and get ya, shit we heard you
Tote that tool, make that double
Better be cool, you don't want no trouble
Keep it leanin' to the left, my gat stay cocked
I'm always super clean when you see me on the block
Keep my money in a knot with a rubberband on it
Blow that marijuana know I got it if you want it
See me standin' on the corner slangin' that crack
You know how it is to be the man in trap
I'll show you how to be a
This shit a dead end street, partner.
The choice is yours, though, homie. Just don't say I ain' tell you.
