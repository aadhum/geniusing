No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
Mr. West is in the buildin'
Swagger on a hundred thousand trillion
Ayo, I know I got it first
I'm Christopher Columbus, y'all just the Pilgrims
Hermes pastel, I pass the dressing
My swagger is Mick Jagger
Every time I breathe on a track, I asthma attack it
‘Cause I slaved my whole life, now I'm the master
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
How it feel to wake up and be the shit and the urine
Naaaaa-na-naaaaa
Tryin' to get that Kobe number, one over Jordan
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
(No one on the corner…) Got a bop like this
Can't wear skinny jeans, ‘cause my knots don't fit
No one on the corner got a pocket like this
So I rock Roc jeans, ‘cause my knots so thick
Follow my steps is the road to success
But I can't teach you my swag
You can pay for school, but you can't buy class
School of hard knocks; I'm a grad
And that all-blue Yankee is my graduation cap
It's Hooooovaaaah
Dippin' different Rovers,
whippin' with the soda
Hooooovaaaah
Did you even have any doubt after Doubt it was over?
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
No one on the corner has swagger like moi
Church,
I got stripes; Adidas
Mamis scream, "¡Papi, no más!"
Now when it comes to styles, I got several
And my jewels blue and yellow
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo
No one on the corner has swagger like us
Swagger like us, swagger-swagger like us
[Verse 4: T.I.]
You can go see Weezy for the wordplay
Jeezy for the bird play
Kanyeezy for diversity,
and me for controversy
Livin' revolutionary, nothin' less than legendary
Gangsta shit hereditary, got it from my dad
