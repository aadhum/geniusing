But it’s been quite a minute since I’ve been here
Like my diamonds are her guiding light
A plethora of fine freaks trailing right behind me
Killin shit dead, turn the club to a crime scene
Bunch of young hoes know Chinese
I keep a quarter key of pussy thats a nine piece
She just started to pop it for a nigga
And look back and tell me “baby, its real”
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will
Do it for the realest niggas in the f-ckin’ game right now
She will, she will, she will
I’m all about “I” give the rest of the vowels back
