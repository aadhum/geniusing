[Intro: Akon]
1, 2, 3 - ooh yea
Ooh oh-oh...
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is
[Verse 1]
Hey Tip, lemme holla at ya...
Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter’s eyes
Kickin it with your sons, trippin, never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn’t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison TIP, it could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin, you been trippin ever since I died
Appreciate you missin me but G, you still alive
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you?
seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car
see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he’s spittin too
and Major supercool
[Hook: Akon]
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
I hope you don’t mind, I hope you don’t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is
[Verse 2]
Sit down, son...
I never knew the time that I ain’t get to spend with you
Would ever result in you making yourself miserable
You gotta let it go, it’s painful, I already know
The past is the past, just learn from the grown
So you got crystal wit you? And your sister Precious too
I’m proud of you, did better than I expected you to
Although I knew you was special when you was smaller
That’s why I was so much harder on you, knew you were smarter
Not much convo to offer, I wasn’t much of a talker
[Verse 3]
What up, Phil? So good to hear from you, we missing you (f'real)
Remembering all of our conversations, daily reminiscing you
Today I watch over Jeanette like she was my own and that could missing you
I swear it’s so unfair that I’m right here and you up there
I miss you so much now to the point I call your name but you not there
I can’t do shit off my mind, I’m so upset
Shot with bullets that were meant for me, familiy's never forgiving me
didn’t graduate from college but
Thanks for listening to me, so long, had this bottled up
