I pop tags on a throwback fast
Nigga please, I'm wearin' these when I cut my grass
I'm the one nigga, young niggas knew is the truth
And the dumb niggas I ain't done provin' it to
Come with a clique of guerillas like I hung at a zoo
I gotta bitch to pull bitches like she one of the crew
Now a buncha broads in the back bustin' it loose
Do it free for me and charge you a hundred or two
Top floor in the presidential with a wonderful view
wrist
I drive Chevys, fuck Mercedes
Hopped out the new CL V12, got in the blue SS
on my beats
I got the fine freaks starin', 'cus my time piece glarin'
When the light hit the carrats, got they eyes lookin' Chinese
Nigga fuck you pay me, I'm all outa favors
What Grand Hustle got ain't a motherfucker gave us
A motherfuckin' thing, but ain't a motherfucker played us
You gotta mil' that's a small percentage
The way ya record deal structured, you only get a small percentage
The 50 Gs'll
They eatin' pussy, suckin' dick until they mouth got gooey
Can't another young nigga in the south outdo me
