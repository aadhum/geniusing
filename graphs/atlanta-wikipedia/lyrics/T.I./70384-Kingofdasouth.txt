I been a menace to society
Since when? since Menace 2 Society
Still refused to become a legitimate citizen quietly
Felt like my label hidin' me
But here I am anyway
I might be back to slangin' grams any day
And if this record flop well I'll be back wit' a bomb of heart
Wit' C-Rod and the squad
this whole industry's a facade
Man this ain't real life
Half these rappers don't know what sacrifice feel like
Man these niggas is all hype,
not even rappin' on real mics
They just get high and say whatever the fuck they feel like
They make me feel like bustin' these niggas one at a time
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
It's only five rappers outta Atlanta who bustin' and I'm one of 'em
The other four, you know who you are
But if you gotta think twice well shawty you ain't nice
Regardless of your publishing deal you can't write
I'm the best thing left blowin' breath on the mic
The king of the south nothin' less will suffice
You wanna bet? Well put yo' budget up
Match the price me and you like putting matches to ice
You won't make it
The truth nigga like Beanie's first LP
You can do a song with N'Sync and couldn't outsell me
I'm a legend in my own time,
a prophet in my own rhymes
A king wit' a concubine
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
Niggas like you, a dime a dozen they come and go
He can keep his watches and gold for his momma to hold
Puttin' holes in yo' Girbaud
wettin' up yo' Polos
Hoppin' back in the
Brougham
Known for kickin' in yo' door
wavin' gats in yo' home
Clearin' it out
I'm sorry I ain't hearin' you out
You hearin' about the squad pumping fear in your heart
Because you know sacrifice was near and dear to your heart
Ay, what these other niggas talkin' I don't believe that shit
I'm the king cause I said it and I mean that shit
what's so special 'bout him ay, he ain't all that shit
I set the city on fire and you seen that shit?
T-I-P,
Grand Hustle,
Pimp Squad for life nigga
Sanchez on the beat, dig this man
Y'all niggas gone send yo' demos in
Get cha little motherfuckin' deal
Go sell records
Nigga I got houses,
I got blow,
I got dro
Nigga I got hoes,
nigga I got property nigga
Come see about me if you don't like it
Rubberband man in this bitch
