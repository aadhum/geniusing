Grand Hustle homie
All Hands on Deck
throw six figures on me
Got a pistol you don't want it
boy you what what it is
I'm way flyer
my pay's way higher
If they ever mention sire boy you know what it is
I got that drama, you don't want no problems
Dial up that llama, boy you know what it is
I get money, all I count is big money
Gon' sell another couple mil' and take it back to the A
Gon' take that other couple mil' and put it back in the safe
I'm up in Crucial two-steppin with the gat in the waist
Don't even try him when you see him boy you have to be great
Cause this pistol hit you in your face, your teeth they'll have to replace
That's if you lucky nigga trust me, it don't hurt me to take
100 thousand to them Haitians you'll be murdered today, nigga
Well they sweatin when they see me, I'm apparently hot
Had the album of the year nigga, Grammy or not
Remember, all day I used to stay in the spot
With two revolvers in my pocket, pitch a hand of that rock
And now, chart toppin, ain't a car I ain't got
I'm the number one customer at my own car lot
You wanna know how much I'm makin, just imagine a lot
You know I'm probably gettin more that you'd imagined I got
Went from the King of the South to the King of the States
Ridin in a car you probably never seen in the states
No idea how much yay I can bring in the states
Hey you can get a hundred on 'em for a million today
Frank Lucas ain't the only one who made a million a day
But it's a American gangsta right here in your face
And you don't wanna see P$C on the scene with a K
Some of them boys wan' talk 'bout they have done
They guns sound like popcorn, ya
