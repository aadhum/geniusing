It's okay
Tomorrow'll be a better day
When ya rent a day late and ya tryna stay straight
We all came in the world with a sparkle in our eye
Not knowing the only thing that we was promise is to die
But a promise is a lie can't nobody guarantee it
Cuz death around the corner can't nobody damn see it
So I tote my strap in the hood at all time
Cuz respect ain't just something that's understood in our time
Especially by our kind
Police don't wanna lock ya up no more they wanna shoot ya
Ain't as half as bad as these hatas'll do ya
As soon as ya get ya loot up, ya body they wanna shoot up
I'm doin this for the hood, the kid wit no dad
I was just like ya'll don't feel so bad
Know it's hard when ya live so bad
They whoop ya ass and they wonder why ya still so bad
For long ya get whoopin's and just laugh
She ask what ya what ya doin ya tell her stuntin' like my daddy
You knew that I was gonna be a hustla when ya had me
Look around ma you sent me to the sto' to get some bread
And I'm passin' at least 8 J's or mo'
When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
If ya son 14 and just died a folk criminal
She know he in a better place
I know you're scarred right now cuz you apart right now
But shit he in better shape than we are right now
But the only way to get it is to slang that weight
When ya speeding wit the white and ya see the blue lights
And ya on ya 3rd strike so the judge say life
