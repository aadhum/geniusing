Rich by popular demand
Yes it is, A-Town connection
Say Toot, I know you see me
Sub-standard condition, still handling business
Only listen to G's, that other shit I don't hear
Shit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care
They say what goes up must come down
But I ain't reach my cruisin' altitude
The places I'm 'bout to go and the money I'm 'bout to see
Gave Bill Gates some binoculars and said, look out for me
Exceeded expectations, even at Def Jam
Cause I married the streets and Atlanta has been my best man
Put one of my partners right through culinary art school
Now he my personal chef so that bread he get it
Celebrating coming from nothing to winning Grammy's
And rappers winning Oscars
Yeah, and they say rappers shouldn't act, nah suckers
We see Samuel Jackson like, whassup motherfucker
Triple that on my bond, thanks to Bigs and Run
But never mind what I been through, just look at what I become
I sold dope and dropped out of school
Seems it's all they can see
They don't notice none of my family did that since me
I broke that cycle
Now my family live a live for
Mandatory minimals
