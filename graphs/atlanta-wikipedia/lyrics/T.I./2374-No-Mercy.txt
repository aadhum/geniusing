My mama loved me more than I do
She said, "ya pops was just like you"
Trapped in a vicious cycle
Tell the judge if he throw a book at me
Make it The Bible
Started calling myself "The King" for lack of a better title
Loyal beyond belief to my detriment
It's so vital I change or blow opportunities
Now while I do not care who telling
Meanwhile, selling powder puts food in the bellies
The orphanage couldn't keep up the mortgages
Kid go to school stupid, they teachers ignoring it
Sorta just doomed, forced into being a goon
selling kush in a jar
Mixing up the tar in a balloon
Consumed with the same way of life I left
Everything I know now, I learned by myself
All you see are the whips
The Maserati's, Ferrari's, so they don't sympathize
Don't nobody feel sorry
Everybody's standing and waitin
Chanting, they' hating
Gospels say they should forgive me
They'd rather hand me to Satan
Blatant, displays the day of hypocrisy
Boy you got to be kidding
Could it be possibly the second coming of Pac is me?
Remember that, when he was here?
And when he died you realized you need him here
God with me partner, ain't no one for me to fear
Hindsight: 20/20
Future not as clear
But I'm a rider 'till I die
I just ask that I can make my peace with God and say goodbye
Fuck up the world like Lady Di
On the day he died, his wife and sons and daughters know that every day he tried
To be a better person,
nah, they wanted better verses
They could market to the merchants
But when they' closed curtains
You could be for certain ain't nobody perfect
But when you're rich, nobody gives a shit
No mercy
