Do it to the maximum, take it while you askin' them
See, I said I was King, and them lames started laughin', them
Same suckers now want the King on a track with 'em
I composed several classicals, you know, like "Top Back"
"Dope Boyz", "Bring 'Em Out"
And "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I top "What You Know About That"
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that!"
Nigga, yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail
I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in the chair
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale
Arizona, California, make it rain anywhere
I tote a pair of .40 cal's, so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin' down
A-Town, West Side, club crucial, catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lie, say they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm somethin' like a stalker, I be e'rywhere the strap be
The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it, nigga, I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell 'em all, double down, nigga, do the math
Think I won't pull up in somethin' with 200 on the dash?
Real nigga vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil daughter and his mama too
You do somethin' to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers
Ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
I do it for the block, that's why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me
I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me
