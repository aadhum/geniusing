Long time no see now I'm back on my feet
Comfortably in back of a v, right back in the stree
You can pose with the game but she married to me
Missed me while I was gone now I'm back in the zone
Got a message for the nigga who attacking the throne
You gon' make me put this heater to the back of your dome
Flip to the last from the front to the back of your home
Any idiot can see you should've left me alone
Cause they know the "Game Over" when I catch you alone
Flip, I'mma show you 'bout addressing me wrong
I'm after your lucky charms nigga let it be known
Anyway, see me shining with immaculate stones
Or somewhere riding through the city, rims have to be chrome
21's, 22's, left factory home
Stop, drop the top, hit the gas and I'm gone
From the box to the top spot where I belong
Could've swore that was my flow I heard on your song
But you should know that releasing mini-me's ain't offending me
Cause rappers always have a tendency to mimic g's
I guess that's just their way of telling me they're missing me
A million sold still there ain't a nigga real as me
Besides, imagery's the finest form of flattery
But now it's time to welcome back the nigga nigga's wanna see
