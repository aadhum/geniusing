Oh y'all niggas done fucked up now!
All bets is off,
the truce is over, fuck the world!
You can see me cautious 'fore you see this Carbon 15, watch it I'll squeeze,
The powder give you power while you gettin' geeked off it
'Til you 6 feet deep dead sleepin' in a coffin
Bet they patnas need suits after they bodies need chalkin'
I'm feelin' standoffish homes, you better back off it
Drop you off the bridge in Florida feed you to the dolphins
Cop 100 bricks in Georgia drive 'em to the office
And if I bag 'em up in ounces better get a mil' off it
Niggas gon' be killed off and they mamas out here lost it
And now they mothafuckin' life it's gonna cost 'em, nigga
You done done it now
Run up on him spray 100 rounds
Gun 'em down
Why these pussy niggas runnin round?
Hunt 'em down
I want they head I want it now
Ferraris
drops
Bentleys
and Mercedes
They envy the nigga's swagger
Would die for the nigga, playa
King of the whole thing, no ifs, no maybes
Tryin' to play fair niggas think its so crazy
That's when the arm raise and the guns gon' blazin'
Cajun, sizzlin' hot it gone crazy
Playin' hard ball you diggin' yo own grave and
If the police get you 'fore me it's O.K
We gon' have a nigga fuckin' you in the prison wit' AIDS
Fuck wit' me I turn you to angels like Snoop Snoop
and "Su-whoop!"
bitch
