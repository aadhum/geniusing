I've been telling you all man to pull these niggas resumes
You better check up on these niggas. these niggas be lying man
These niggas ain't really kicking this shit they be telling you all man
They probably try to come in the hood and sell weed
Think it's all good until they run into some real G's
Holla tell us where it is
And I promise we'll leave
One time got robbed got shot got shook
Got a job started rhyming came up with a hook
Got a chain and some tats came up with a look
Went and made a hit record
Talked tough in a book
Fuck the image and perception they never tough as they look
They some mother fucking suckers
If he got a pistol bet he don't spray it
You ain't really on the edge
You ain't really under suspicion of the feds
You just telling them you is instead
You never bought us head
But you get behind the mic and just say it
The people oughta know I must say it!
You damn right
These niggas don't have rights
To rap about the shit I did every night
You ever went to jail for selling white
Niggas tell you what they want you to hear
Don't tell me real recognize real eventually they'll see
