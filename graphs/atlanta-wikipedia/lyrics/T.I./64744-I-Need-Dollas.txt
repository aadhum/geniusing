And I need dollar dollar, a dollar that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me
Bitch it's still none other than the King
Need green just to occupy my rubberbands
When I started I was trapping
Woke up ballin like "what happened?"
Let's just smoke up in this city
Let me get 100 milli and focus on a billi
cheddar,
paper,
fetti,
dough
No less than 7 zeroes, stimulate bitches libido
Flow crazy just like Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo
He's so hungry for the money like he's still selling dimes
Ain't no vacation, working like a Jamaican, mixed with a Hatian
Several different occupations - no exaggeration
a mil a movie
PRPS, Gucci, Louis got my head as big as Stewie's
20 mil's the answer if you ask me how Akoo is doing
If we racing to the top, no competition, I'm a shoe-in
Used to want dough like JC
but now I'm thinking Donald Trump
Bob Johnson,
Warren Buffett,
fuck it, it ain't that tough
dollar bills add up..
