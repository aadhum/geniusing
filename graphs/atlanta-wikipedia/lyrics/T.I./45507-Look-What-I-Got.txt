Presidential roll,
gold rolex watch
With no rocks
I save them for the pinky
Keep you niggas blinkin'
He ain't wearin' platinum, Naw
But I keep you niggas thinking

They be lookin in a car
They can't even see in
In the
He was rappin' in the cafeteria
But now that nigga serious
The respect of the niggas and G's
