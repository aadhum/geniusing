If racism ain't in color then it's damn sure in the class
Got the races on each other, you got niggas then there's blacks
You got crackers then there's whites, separated by the green
It ain't no reason why you shouldn't have success, right?
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
Anybody interrupt freedom, kill 'em
Word to Robert F. Williams, feel 'em
Devil got me sick to my stomach, boo
Word to Elijah Muhammad, ooh
You ever step your foot in Kemet, bitch we slit your throat
We send them funny fuck boy preacher types back to the Pope
Fuck is you? Fuck your Zeus or fuck Medusa
This the school of Shaka Zulu
Lumumba
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
Filling my pocket with Benjamins
Fuck the police, they crooked as they come
They pull you over and know you legit
Ask you for your license, when you reach then they dump
suppo'
Forty acres and a Muller
I spent my reparations on the jeweler
