I hope they get my good side
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
When alone I ask myself, is it worth it? I ain't perfect
Neither is anybody else
but I think my kids deserve
To be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions
When the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion
And I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
You've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes
It's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show
You see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it
Knew the risks and the consequences and I still do it
And then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it
Kid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me
It's safer to watch it on T.V
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
I guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes
He said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)
Won't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)
I know better than to ever talk during the film...
In' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight
To when you can't see what's wrong from right
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
I walk they follow (ay)
I talk they holla (ay)
Just here for your amusement
My life, your entertainment
You watch it while I live it (live it)
You waitin' for me to lose it
I guess I'm just here for your amusement
