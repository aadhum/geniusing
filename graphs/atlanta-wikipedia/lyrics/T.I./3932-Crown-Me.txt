Serve big crack in white T's and fitted caps
this my life you just spit raps
I been a hustler all my life gimme six stacks
Cop my self a quarter kite I can flip that
Cook it till its solid white tell â€˜em hit that
Big fat Os of that solid hard git that
Now I'mma move it five days, nigga, 6 max
And ain't no runnin' off with yay shootin' big straps
40 cals, Sk's with no kick back
You don't know the click, I gotta enough wild niggas that'll
Hit you then drive you to another town nigga, dig a
Hole throw you in it for a half a brick a blow
fags
You don't know how to count chump, 2 times 2
You don't know what the grind is like or that new rock do
You don't know what it is to see that shoe box full
Ask about me, you thought really Tony was vicious
I lock the block down
Like a jailhouse lockdown
Cops found, razors in the mattress
2003, the street's new Hannibal
I'm guerrilla, born lion hearted, ape bread
And I play dead, just to fool you, just to move you
this shit is cuckoo
Cha ching, I'm in
But my 2 nine M's, they the ying yang twins
Cus they Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, Skeet, from the window to the wall
From the ceiling to the floor
'Im into don things
Don Dom, Donna Karan, Don Cornelius, Don King
But follow Jon Gotti, Joe Pesci, armed robbery
Hard body, body hard doggy fuck up your bodyguard
Her booby want her back the coochie, play saluchi wit it
Half a mil on lawyer cost
