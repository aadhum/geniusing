All I got is trouble, most you niggas know it
Pistols in the duffle anybody lookin for it
Who want some? (Who want it bitch) who want some? (Who want it ho)
You know anybody get it if you want some
Flyest in the city, all I do is ride
Aye you can miss me with that bullshit
And when you see me holla at me if you want it bitch
Okay you can miss me with that bullshit
And when you see me holla at me if you want some nigga
I'm trouble man, stay in trouble, trouble's all I know
A snub nose 44 fitted on my clothes
I love to hustle, trust no one, I'm countin all my dough
In Magic City stacks of 20 big tall I throw
I do a party a 100 G's to the mall I go
The slow flow, bought the four floor, Mansion out in Cali
Got a matte black Rolls Royce,
Bullet proof Denali
Better check a nigga head say he better than me
Man if they really wanna beef I leave em dead as can be
I'm back up in this bitch with Toomp, OG what they wanna do?
I shoot a nigga, catch a case and beat it in a month or two, leggo
Half a million dollar chain, shit so big it's a shame
Millionaire still hang with niggas out there dealin cocaine
My address and my ensemble that's 'bout all I'mma change
Man play them games if you want to, all my niggas with it
We can bang if you want to,
"Like ain't he learned from the time that he done did in the pen?
Man here this skinny nigga go talkin bout pistols again" aaaahhh
We been through this, how many times have you niggas forgot?
I get locked up, get out on top, whether you like it or not
Let us remember 'fore my fed case now I was a head case
Hit a nigga neighborhood tell 'em bring the yellow tape
I calmed down for my kids and my mom now
Run up on them sucka niggas, you can put your arms down
And FYI I never put my arms down
Tell the ATF I got three more .380's left haaaa
