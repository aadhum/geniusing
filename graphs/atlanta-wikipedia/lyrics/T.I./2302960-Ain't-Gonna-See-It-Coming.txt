[Verse]
Hey, jumped off the porch, with one thing on my mind
Find a way to make a fortune, and keep from doing time
I accomplished one of those, but the other nevermind
Think I'm Triple 6, 8 Ball, MJ, Lil Jon
Crunk off in that pussy leanin' in it  tryin' kill some
She workin' on the pipe like this way she pay her bill from
Cuz them other cats she fucked just fill it up a lil some
2 things I don't like: A bitch who can't shut up and one who wanna stay the night
Whatchu say you playin' right?
You been hit the blunt and tell Uber to meet you at the light, hoe
Back to where you came from, that's just how the dice roll
Uncle Quentin, Man, they raised me don't take shit from anyone
Bet 10 to 1, bet you won't reach my level of success 'fore my kids are grown
I'm gettin' topped off in a Thunderbird
I guess you can call that some ThunderDome
And I'm already off of whatever you on, bitch
Aye I'm king of whatever man let it be known
I don't give a damn bout you making no song
You better watch what you say in your song
'Fore you see what happen when faking go wrong
learn from Jimmy Henchmen and rapping like Jay
