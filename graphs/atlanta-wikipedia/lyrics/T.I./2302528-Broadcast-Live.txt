[Intro]
OK we broadcast live from the West Side
Where the real nigga ride and the rest die
You keep your face card good and your nose clean
Never trust the word of a dope fiend
Keep a strap at all times run them numbers up
If that ain't what you want you ain't one of us
We broadcast live
From a hellhole
You sell blow, better get enough to get an elbow
Or you ain't shit
You be the man when you seen bricks
And not before that
Happen that kept me with it
All I ever wanted was a widebody Benz
And a bad bitch, you ain't got no widebody friends
OK we broadcast live from the west side
Where the real nigga ride and the rest die
Ayy don't be out here talking bout shit that you don't know about
You catch a lick and do your time, you don't testify
You keep your face card good and your nose clean
Never trust the word of a dope fiend
Keep a strap at all times run them numbers up
If that ain't what you want you ain't one of us
We broadcast live
From the gutter, nigga get high with they mother
To take they mind off they father go do some time for they brother
My uncle mad tell me boy you better be the man
You better fight, they whoop your ass then you fight again (damn)
Expecting nothing but the money, spend it fast as it coming
In God We Trust, for everyone else the cash all
OK we broadcast live from the west side
Where the real nigga ride and the rest die
Ayy don't be out here talking bout shit that you don't know about
You catch a lick and do your time, you don't testify
You keep your face card good and your nose clean
Never trust the word of a dope fiend
Keep a strap at all times run them numbers up
If that ain't what you want you ain't one of us
OK we broadcast live from the west side
