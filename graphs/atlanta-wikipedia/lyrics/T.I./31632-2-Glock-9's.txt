T.I.P. King of the South
Two Glock nines
You wanna know about the mac
Man I come through with them heats
And you know how we play
When we poppin' them Glocks
Take it to the AK
Chopper the block
And to the SWAT's
Helicopter the block
And them put you on the news
Wasn't proper to watch
You know I act like my clips I'm bananas
Catch me in your strip all black in bandanas
I dare a nigga act retarded
So I can let this tar lift you off your feet like Vince Carter
Two Glock nines
Any motherfucker whisperin about mine[x4]
Yeah I know you're holdin' weight
So just gimme the keys
Me and MAC comin' in two Jags
