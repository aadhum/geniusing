(Ay, who I be?)
Rubberband man
wild as the Taliban
9 in my right, 45 in my other hand
Call me Trouble Man
Always in trouble, man!
Worth a couple hundred grand
Chevys all colors, man
Rubberband man
Like a one-man band
Treat these niggas like the Apollo
And I'm the Sandman
Tote a hundred grand
Cannon in the waistband
Looking for a sweet lick?
Well this is the wrong place, man
7-time felon, what I care about a case, man?
I'm campaigning to bury the hate
So say ya grace, man
Ay, I don't talk behind a nigga back
I say it in his face
Check my resume, nigga
My record's impeccable
Anywhere in the A nigga
How T.I.P. is highly respectable
And in the M.I.A. nigga
I'm tryna keep it professional
Cause all this tongue rustling
Finna have me snappin,
From the bottom of the Duval
Cakalacky to New York
And everybody showing me love
That's one to you all

Yeah, to all my Florida niggas, my Cakalacky niggas
My LA niggas
Stayed in some trouble man
Some niggas still hating on shawty
Got a couple fans
That love to do nothing other than
Lick, suck, show 'nuff respect
But still I love 'em, man
little pimping
Stay down on his grind
Put the crown on the hustle
Ay, I could show you how to juggle anything
And make it double
Weed, blow, real estate, liquor store
With no trouble
Young Cassius Clay of my day
Marvin Gaye of my time
Tryna stay alive
Living how I say in my rhymes
My cousin used to tell me:
"Take this shit a day at a time"
And told me Friday, died Sunday
Wednesday in the ground
And so I'm doing all my shows
Just like he in the crowd
throw your lighters up for my cousin Toot
Aaliyah
Left Eye
Jam Master Jay
Grand Hustle man
Mo' hustles than Hustle Man
"But why the rubber band?"
It representing the struggle man!
My folk gonna trap
Until they come up with another plan
Stack a couple grand
To get theyself off they mama land
Gangsters who been serving
Since you was doing the running man
Went down, did 10
Back round and rich again
That's why I'm young
With the soul of an old man
I'm shell-shocked, get shot
Slow your roll, man
Still ride around
With the Glock on patrol, man
I ain't robbing
I'm just looking for that dro, man
For my niggas slanging blow, pimping hoes
Rollin' vogues, 24s
Let these other niggas know
