Ok, we started catching felonies in Bankhead
Riding through the hood in a hot box
In '96, in the hood, had a trap house
Every day cruise through the city, crack rock
Got a pistol in my pocket and a bankroll
Walk up, pull out a Smith and Wesson, push it real bad
Now the undercover people left for dead
Styrofoam, double cup, codeine drinking
