Grand Hustle
Look, I'm this far from being a star and just that close to quitting
I never should've came close to missing
But I want to be a musician, pimping, not a politician
feel my position, it's a rough transition
Plus I'm way too deep in the game to be trying to change
For fortune and fame and glamour
I can be in the slammer
Or six feet up under Atlanta
It's a blessing to breathe
I walk the streets with seven felonies, I'm blessed to be free
Long as somebody up in heaven who keep blessing a G
T.I.P.'ll still be blessing CD's
So haters you can see these
Cause I'm back now with something to prove
Everything to gain, pimping, nothing to lose
Unless you ran with Cap and C-Rod
Trapped with K.T. and robbed with J.R
Fucked hoes with D.P
Broke bread with J.G
Switched labels like K.P
Me, even though I'd rather go back to slanging drugs and shit
It's a gang of niggas and bitches really love this shit
I can't quit
Even though polices hate, I'm legit
And rappers hate it cause they know I'm the shit
People hate it when you better than them
They ain't hating, start worrying then
It's been ten years, an album, and two deals
For real, we all know I should have sold two mill
It's all good though, I flow for the streets
I do it for y'all
Every weekend see who in the mall
Posing for pictures with girls
Passing niggas the dro
One of the realest rappers niggas'll know
But niggas be hating
To the point that they be calling the station ("Don't play his record")
And I see they petty and bogus
Got to stay selling records cause the fame ain't shit
And fuck the units that they name will sell
It'll break your heart to see your favorite rappers lame as hell
Get a Benz, I'll value your opinion then
