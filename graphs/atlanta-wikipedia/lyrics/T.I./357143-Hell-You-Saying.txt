Somebody tryna tell you Hustle Gang ain't gettin' to the money
Tell that nigga "You a mothafuckin' lie"
[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
I make rainy days, it's a drought for you
Y'all ain't crusin' my altitude
I'm a boss bitch, I let you spread the rumors
Yea you talkin' shit but not an ounce true
Million dollar misfit, my money pilin'
All over the lettuce like Thousand Island
My dough runnin' like a broken faucet
I'm the landlord, you in the housing projects
In the drive-thru, makin' bank deposits
Crazy money, insane asylum
Boss Chase, got her taxes filed
And then I blow the rest while I’m at Saks shopping
Amsterdam, Germany and Holland
Changing your currency to dollars
It's Iggy bitch, and this boss shit
Where the pounds at?
No trending topic
You got a bad bitch? I gotta have that buddy
Sick flow, might need Penicillin, nigga
I do the impossible like I oughta do
And y'all pussy niggas smaller than a molecule
Never leave the house 'less I'm awfully flee
Always leave the show with somethin' soft to squeeze
Take a little dab of this, a little drag of this
Then she reached down my pants, grabbed my shaggy dick
Left that mothafucka's home covered in my kids
Buck the dome, Milwaukee shit
Mind so big
High as hell, hittin' comets
I’m raunchy, your niggas rock Givenchy
I ain't gotta say it, I ain't gotta wear it
