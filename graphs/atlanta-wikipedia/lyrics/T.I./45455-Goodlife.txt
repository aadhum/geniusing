I keep telling myself
Man I'm living the good life
I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Streets always would be a part of me, it made me the truest
Now I come through in a Coupe on 22's
Don't get me wrong I never been a fool
I just put off graduating for a pair of tennis shoes
I used to use the beat to paint my pain
But nowadays man I can't complain
I got several automobiles and they all on thangs
Several with solid tags and they all in one chain
And gettin brains from a couple of broads on the plane
I come from Chi-Town lost and found in the struggle
Where dudes say stay safe and stay out of trouble
Speak is muffed the law and B gon try to cuff you
Those with duffles move weight and have muscles
I came through the dirt with a verse for the people
Open up for Daddy Kane and Eazy up at the Regal
The radio rarely put their needle on my record
Sounds projected, ain't show how effective
Lessons learned, sessions turned to life reflected
And everything I found real in life know I kept it
They say life's a teacher, you're gonna get tested
When a nigga changed they keep saying that nigga strange
They couldn't see how my mind want bigger things
Ahead of my time now I caught up with the game
Making good music making paper making change
And it's good
Man you niggas think Suge was off the wire
You should've seen the squad before I had Messiah
We assumed the title as the number one supplier
Felt like I was selling blow since I was in diapers
Quick to up and scrap with niggas who want to deny
For what we considered then as a lucrative empire
Now I wonder what the judge think as he reading my priors
Prison ain't full and the reaper ain't bias
Anybody tell ya different's a damn liar
Lived through worse and reversed the curse
