L.A. gone and I ain't gotta deal no mo' (Picture that)
Some niggas wonder what my goal is
They think it's goin gold havin hoes sweatin me
Fuck that, I'm in it for the longevity
Picture me as one of the greatest that'll ever be
Compare me to, 2Pac, B.I.G., and Jay-Z
Organized No-I-Z.,
and J.D
Neptunes
Dre's beats
Fly to Miami, chill with Luke
and we can trade freaks
