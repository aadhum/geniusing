Loud pack, burnt up
The American dream, I'm livin' in it
To Trayvon get some Jesses, I kill a bitch every minute
Tomorrow 50-50, today is our hour
If you ain't down to die for something your life ain't worth living
Modern day, near perfect, I'm the son of man
Every summer kill shit, call me Son of Sam
