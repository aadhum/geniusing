Crème de la crème
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
Down low, down low, down low, I like my top let back
Let back, let back, let back let back, let back
with a chopper in the back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
I'm the man in my city ain't nobody fucking wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I got this Pimp Squad Click, I know you heard about us
808 kicking
I got some bitches in a Benz and my partners in the Chevy
Meanwhile, I'm racing my Ferrari like a light for a buck
Against Lamborghini Gallardos every time I get a car
