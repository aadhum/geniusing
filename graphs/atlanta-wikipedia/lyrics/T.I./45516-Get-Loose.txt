Ay, I wanna see you dance like them girls in that Tip Drill video...
No grey goose, if you don't get loose
My potnas in the club and we chillin' to the max
Poppin' bottles, blowin' money, we ain't learn how to act
All in the V.I.P. spendin' four or five stacks
You can tell it's T.I.P. from how I bend my hat
Send the waitress to the bar but she comin' right back
Bet a shot of x-o'll get you on the right track
Rough sex, talkin' dirty, yea she into all that
Gotta movie that'll prove that what I'm sayin' is all fact
No grey goose, if you don't get loose
Let me see you drop it down, get that eagle on girl
Ain't no fuckin' way I'm leavin' here alone girl
Baby, I can make a mill if I rap or if I sing
Lunatic mayne, straight up out the heartland
Nine on my right, ten more karats on my other hand
worth a couple hundred grand
How yo waist stay still but you move that there
Ain't got a clue right there
Seen a lotta ass poppin', but that's new right there
No grey goose, if you don't get loose
You ready to get loose, shawty, better be
Sittin' on them leather seats
If not, pat yo feet on the concrete merely
Freak by choice, not force, I would never be
Charged with a rape, if she say no, I'mma let her be
Why should I let that worry me?
Got yo girl stretched out, pullin' up her dress
Checkin' out her spread and I am impressed
G-strings right in the middle of them wet
Her girlfriends with her and all of them next
No grey goose, if you don't get loose
Woooo weeee
Ladies and gentleman
