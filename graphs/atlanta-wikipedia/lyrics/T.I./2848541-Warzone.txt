Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
They left his body swangin' down in Piedmont
At a Klan rally the day before, but that ain’t mean nothing
What they say "a suicide", I say it's genocide
Hey what you got a gun for? Boy you ain’t finna ride
They pull you over, ask you where your license at
Be careful reachin' for it, you know you can die for that
And this ain't nothin' new, just got cameras so you can see the shit
Hey listen, you won't shoot at them then shoot at me?
This goes to the white boy that ran in the old church
I hope you get slow murked, and they torture you slow first
Ran in our place of worship to slaughter our grandma
Heard it from buddy who took for the fall for Watergate
The war on drugs was just a war on us
Went from Freeway Ricky
on to BMF (free Meech)
Cause white kids gravitated to it like all us did
Alton
Sterling
killed Philando right in front of the girl
This modern day slavery, the prison publicly traded
The Constitution and Emancipation Proclamation's just a fuckin' piece of paper
Dedicated, tell 'em,"Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe
Hands up, can't breathe"
Hands up, can't you see we livin' in a war zone?
