"Hate the price of fame 'coz it cost too much" (yeah boy)
"And you lame niggas talk too much
On the streets is people who won't rest unless I rest in peace
This could be the reason I ignored the penitentiary
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses ain't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
I'm a man, I ain't perfect, gotta admit it I'm guilty
But understand
'Coz niggas out there plot to rob me and kill me
500 thousand every year spent on security
And my future was bright, but now it's gettin blurry
'Coz niggas in a hurry to find me and bury me
But surely, God will deliver me up out it
I'm a fighter to the heart and I forever be about it
I'm a father to my sons, an asset to my community
Look at all that I done, my good weigh the negativity
Mentally, I was focused on not lettin history
Repeat itself, thatâ€™s why heat was kept in the vicinity
"Yes officially I broke the law but not maliciously"
Through all of the publicity, was anybody considerin
My position and the logic came from my decision
Either die or go to jail, that's a hell of a decision
But I'm wrong and I know it my excuses ain't important
I'm just tryna let you know that I ain't think I had a choice
yesterdays
I mean look at folk like Sean taylor
You know what they said they said had he had a strap
He would have lived today
You know I'm smarter than you man
You know I'm smarter than you dawg
Ey if you think I was just being stupid
Shawty I got some mufukin ocean front property in Idaho for sale homie
If you beleive that T gotta bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you partnah
You know what I'm sayin? If you dont understand that you don't
Understand english im done talking!
