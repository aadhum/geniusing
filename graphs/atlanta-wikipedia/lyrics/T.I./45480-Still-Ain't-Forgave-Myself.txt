Glocks in my toy box
I'm slangin slabs, trappin hard, movin heavy Cain
I bought an '85 Cutlass on some dane-a-danes
Now I'm the shit, huh, the motor blew in 30 days
School just a white man game, and it's ran good
At 16, here's my introduction to manhood
Blue lights behind me, damn what I'm gonna do
Cause I got 2 pounds of weed in the car and a .380 too
I'm guessin everything'll be aiight if I just keep it cool
How ya doin officer, what ya mean why I ain't in school
Can you search the car?? Yea but, I rather that you didn't
Besides it's just a waste of your time cause ain't nothin' in it
(Laugh) I guess that's when I seen, that I ain't know shit
When stuck in a place wit freedom I ain't gone get
Outta all the niggas I was wit when I was doin wrong
3 in the fed, 1 doin life, and 2 dead and gone
I knew I coulda told Cap not to kill shawty
Put down the gun, get in the car let 'em live shawty
You'll probably get locked up, and I'll probably have a deal shawty
Naw, I ain't scared, I'm just telling ya like it is shawty
