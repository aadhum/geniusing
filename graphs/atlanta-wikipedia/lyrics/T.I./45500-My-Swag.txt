I'm the man from Atlanta, to way out in Cali
Catch me in New York, I'm on the way to Miami
I be in Hawaii, then catch me in Paris
I be at home barely, I'll sleep when I'm buried
What I need some sleep for? This dope got me geeked up
But my folk got that work in like they back in the 80's
See I'm gettin wet, and this bitch in the same boat
I came a long way but shawty ain't nuttin changed though
I still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro
Run up on me wrong, now what you think I'mma do bro?
moving yay by the ton
How I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin
In a coffee shop smokin dro in Amsterdam
Hahhh, y'all niggas keep up
By the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga I'll be in Cuba
The Earth's my turf my nigga
