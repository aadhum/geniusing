Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off, take it off, let me, let me see you take it off, take it off
[Verse 1: T.I.]
leaving hand prints on your derri√®re
Now can you just kiss it for me while I'm doing 'bout a hundred on the highway?
[Chorus]
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off, take it off, let me, let me see you take it off, take it off
[Verse 2: T.I.]
I love how you kick it in public, but in private, we on some wild shit
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off, take it off, let me, let me see you take it off, take it off
[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We're in hell and lady you're the closest thing to heavenly
[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let me see you, see you, let me see you take it off, off
Let me see you take it off, off, take it off, let me, let me see you take it off, take it off
