Wherever you are, I'm sorry I'm gone (oh-oh)
Them bitches say they miss me, tell em shawty not long (yeah, yeah)
I pull up, hop out, all the bitches like wow (oh-oh)
Now from LA to the bay, I make em say (oh-oh)
And from New York to MIA, bitches say (yeah, yeah)
From Chi-Town to the D, bitches scream (oh-oh)
St. Louis, Houston do you wanna go with me? (yeah)
On that 599 guts like a bloody nose
One 5 for a movie, quarter mil for a show
Sweet heart to a lady, still hard on a ho
I know they be on that radio wiling
While we chilling somewhere on an island, smiling
On a big yacht is he really that hot
Bitches hoppin on my dick, 'fore I hop up out the car
Walk away with 5 or 6 as im passing by the bars
See im tuggin on my zipper as I fire up my cigar
Lets get this straight, you go get naked get it crackin till tomorrow
Yeah we in the same book, but I'm on another page (capeesh)
King off the leash out the cage on the streets
Kill niggas like AIDS
Caught a case, did a bid,
