Got an elephant memory it's flawless
I remember all of y'all who was talkin'
Got a good mind to run in your office
My partner died in my honour
I'm responsible for his mama
Contract almost expired, they get one more album off it
Better go tell Edgar Bronfman make my contract big as Bosh's
feds
Just one more year of paper, then I'm back to blowin' broccoli
Sosa gang
Why you ain't talking shit now nigga
