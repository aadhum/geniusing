Now, thinkin hard as I walk out my house
What the fuck have I done now, what could he be talkin 'bout?
I been stayin outta trouble, shit I been on the couch
Just workin on the album, I was listenin now
You sayin you don't know 'bout it? (Know 'bout what?)
Atlantic Records said you called the office and went nuts
Makin death threats talkin loud gettin buck
(Man they said I did what? Folk I'm just gettin up!)
