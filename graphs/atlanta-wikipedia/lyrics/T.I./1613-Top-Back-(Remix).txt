Crème de la crème, homie,
top shelf you know
I like my beat down low, down low, down low, down low
I like my top let back
I let my chain hang low get that thing up on my waist
All them haters talking reckless tell 'em say it to my face
Concealed bankroll, yeah, I almost caught a case
It's the remix so Mannie Fresh drop the bass
I say now 28 inches got me sitting so high
Got my 87 zone, goddammit I'm fly
I push the Yukon Wednesday, the drop top Monday
Ice cream Impala same color as a sundae
So you can miss me with that hating and that "He can't rap shit"
Tell them faggot-ass niggas wrap their lips around my dick
Black on black Bentley call it "Phantom of the Opera"
Lemon lime drop top, I call it a Sprite
[Hook x2: T.I.]
I like my beat down low and my top let back
Can see me ridin 24's with a chopper in the back
You like your Kenwood hot and your top let back
If your rims sit high and your windows pitch black
Them 27's tall but them eights are damn raw
Bitches know they see the platinum is gray like grandpa
Spray the Chevy all kind of sour apple colors
Diamonds up in my charm look like pineapple suckers
TEC-9 for some, MAC-90 for others
Nah, this ain't the movie, but I shot four brothers
Cars without the covers,
Hook x2
I don't slam no doors, hop in where the roof go
What I need a roof fo', replace it with the sky
Streets be mine with that Georgia on my mind
I ride in the wettest paint, like I'm surfing on a tidal wave
Cocaine whip, yeah, straight out the microwave
Man in the trunk,
Cigarello full of 'dro and the chevy two-toned
I see some hot girls, so I'm a turn it up a lil'
Hook x2
Even though I like my beat down low and my top let back
wet back
Make them bitches sit back woofers give 'em wet cats
It is you can tell I hear the tire yelling er' lane
I bet I could let Phil hear it
Okay my money real big, choppers is still here
They catch me with it fuck it I'm doing my lil bid
And my drop top riding with my Glock cocked riding
I'm looking for them niggas where they at stop hiding
Now that's a motherfuckin remix nigga
