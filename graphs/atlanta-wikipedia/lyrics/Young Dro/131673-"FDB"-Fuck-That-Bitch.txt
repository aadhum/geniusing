Westside, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch, fuck that bitch
Three, what you wanna do here?
Bitch, I'mma float like root beer
Still workin' on gettin' the coupe cleared
Red on the bottom, right, they're red
Shawty, she a model her hair red
Bitch you ugly and bitch you ugly
And both y'all hoes look scary
I don’t wanna get married (Nope)
Chick, you a bird, parrot
I'm ridin' round and I'm gettin' it in and I'm bunkin (2 Chainz)
She seen my Audemar she tried to touch that,
I said bitch
I train hoes I’m a pimp Trinidad James clothes
Three, FDB man
fly like AirTran
Me and E-Louie's got checkerboards on
You ain’t got that pair, man
With my FDB clique, 33 deep shit
where’s your skirt at?
Ah I like it blowin' that kush on you like purp packs
Y’all niggas so whack
and bitch you so green
I pull up on the scene in the green Saleen
Yeah nigga I’m too clean
Westside what's upper?
Y'all niggas my supper
Fuck that bitch 'fore I do that shit
I might need me a rubber
Belly on rotund,
one whip, four guns
If you see the baby mamma holler:
Fuck that bitch, that ho ain't no one
Everything y’all did, it been done
My True game and my shoe game
You can’t touch that shit
A bitch that holler ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
