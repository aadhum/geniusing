[Intro: DJ Drama]
Hustle Gang
Remix! F.D.B!
[Bridge: Young Dro]
West Side, Bankhead, that's where I'm from
Everything y’all did, it been done
My Tru game and my shoe game
Can’t touch that shit
[Hook: Young Dro]
Bitch steady holl'in' ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch (x2)
Bitch steady holl'in' ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch (x2)
Bitch steady holl'in' ‘bout "fuck me?"
Nah, fuck that bitch
[Verse 1: Young Dro]
I'mma go three, stupid on the remix
I'mma show you how to raise up out the fire like a phoenix
I'm a Bankhead nigga, so I'm straighter than a penis
If ya try the Westside, I'mma nut up like semen
Ice got me anemic, walking up in Neiman's
And everytime I get a new broad, I get subpoenaed
My baby mama mad and my girl look like a genie
I got racks like Venus, 20 stack in my jeans
Bread like panini, eating steaks and zucchini
Wit' ya broad in Tahiti, spaghetti string bikini
I don't spit on tracks, I throw up on 'em like bulimic
Pardon, my High Time album a problem, wait!
Eastside, Candler Road
She twerk that pussy, Hannah Montana, ho
Southside girls got all the game
Northside girls sniff all the 'caine
Eastside girls talk all the shit
And all the Westside girls say "fuck that bitch"
And my shoe game, oh, nah, already know
I do things, Liu Kang, ready, set, go, uh
Well, my girl got a girl, guess I'm living like Dro
Dro, clean in this bitch
Now, I'm finna shoulder lean in this bitch
Hit her off the Goose then duck that chick
