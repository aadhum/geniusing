Dro; that's all nigga
Car don't come out 'til fall nigga
Whoop a nigga ass with a tall nigga
Nigga we ain't stuntin' yo broads nigga
Fuck you boy you lame as hell
And them niggas came with you they lame as well
In Texas get head that's Astrodome
I love ham and cheese its mayo time
Two thousand twelve, not soon nigga
Big tools, my whole platoon
Will wet a nigga chest like a water balloon
So you better assume what you ought to assume
Order twenty more thou', nigga, bada-bazoom
Pocket BK double whopper so you know they cheesy
Free me
Got some true freaks with me so cute in the face
They lil' bad ass call 'em my Boosie babies
