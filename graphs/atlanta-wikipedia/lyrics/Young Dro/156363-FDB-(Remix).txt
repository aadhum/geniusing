float like root beer
Still workin' on gettin' the Coupe cleared
Bitch you ugly and bitch you ugly
And both y'all hoes look scary
Chick, you a bird - Parrot
Her hips phat I seen her walk past I was like shit
Audemar
she tried to touch that, I said "bitch?"
I train hoes, I’m a pimp, Trinidad James clothes
West Side, Bankhead, is where I'm from
Everything y’all did has been done
My True game and my shoe game
Eastside, Zone 6 where I'm from
Got a couple hundreds I'mma throw 'em like ones
Fuck her with a rubber, I ain't tryna have sons
Nigga mean-mugging, they don't really want none
I'm turnt up, too loud
Ratchet bitches won't do me
I'm like "What the hell I'mma do now?"
I'm rich, used to be poor
I don't really trust 'em if I met 'em on tour
Bought a new house, livin' on the top floor
Elevator go *BING* when you at the front door
I ain't never do chores, I ain't never do trash
I ain't made no beds, got a maid with an ass
Put 'em on blast, I don't give a fuck
Got a bad bitch like she peed on the rug
I used to live off of Candler in '88 like piano
I'll put your girlfriend on camera
I see the future, Ciara
Molly all in her champagne, she knew it
Big Sean that baby moms, I do it
Fuck that bitch with a broken dick, I love my new girl
She don't talk shit, she don't act extra
She just give brain and the brain so MENSA
Put her in the game, but a nigga might bench her
I don't pay attention, I don't even text her
She wanna talk shit, but then have a friendship
Fuck you, bitch, and I hope you offended
Beeyotch!
