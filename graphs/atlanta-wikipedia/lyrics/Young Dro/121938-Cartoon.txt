Ride wit the tool-ey
Broads wanna do me
Get Fresh Louie
Iceberg goofy
Cops wanna do me
Niggas scared of me, my partners say
They begging for the chopper play
Bodyguard killers, got a house where Kevin Costner stay
Never put the Glock away
Jackers try to 2-step I make they ass rock away
Elegant, catch me at a symphony and opera play
Paint the 'rari popper gray
and blow the whole top away
No matter what the coppers say
Still move a block a day
or lay where Jimmy Hoffa lay
Rebel outlaw, that's the same shit that Pac would say
Niggas gotta walk away,
my chopper long as Dr. J
candy coat
Spend dollars with your ho
Shawty says she wanna see me naked like D'Angelo
Bankhead nigga eating octopus and swordfish
Fake faggot-ass clique full of Boy Georges
They hate the team cause the yard full of Rolls Royces
Niggas try, ain't no stoppin us, I fried 'em like tilapia
President dinner bitch, a grand for the lobster
