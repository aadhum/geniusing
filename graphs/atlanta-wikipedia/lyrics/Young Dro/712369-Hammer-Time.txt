limo
Whoop a nigga ass like Kimbo
Hold up where
This shit cold

They don't see a nigga cause the tint tho
Pinto
You want a couple those get the info
Break down dimes look like like mentos
If the shoes ain't a grand, we don't get those
Uh, hurry up nigga this the last ki
They don't know where the fiberglass safe at
To get in that bitch you need a glass key
I'm ballin' like a mothafuckin' athlete
These niggas can't rap if you ask me
Boat motor chevy
Pink berry Mollie bitch rasby
“Dro spit like Pac” nigga begged him
$5000 Yorkie named Poochie
On the yacht boat nigga I’m the crew chief
If a 30 year old bitch wanna do me
She gotta put 30 inches on a Dually
Got a cashmere drop top Burban
Got waves in my hand,
Al Qaeda nigga with the turban

Green and white Bobby and Whitney
Popping they kidney, way blacker than Poitier Sidney
Got Cartier with me
After Louis, I kill em in the premium denim
You medium, nigga

I got flavor, check out my ingredients nigga
I get higher than a balloon with helium in it
I'm really a menace
Rush a ho like Willie McGinest
I'm really committed to fuckin with the richest of bitches
I'm itching for digits
I'm part way pimpin efficient
Bitches see the Chevrolet and get to winking and wishing
