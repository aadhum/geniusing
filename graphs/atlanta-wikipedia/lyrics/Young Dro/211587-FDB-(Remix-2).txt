Coke Boys, South Bronx, that's where I'm from

Bread like panini, eating steaks and zucchini
Pardon, my High Time album a problem, wait!
Rollie iced like a hockey player
Kick it like a soccer player, nigga hating like a goalie

In a presidential suite, nigga, me on three
Why they call me pussy pumper? Nigga, she gon' see
Like she gon' see, like she gon' see
[Interlude: Young Dro]
