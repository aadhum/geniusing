Now we've got a lot of things, a lot of racism in the world right now, Who's more racist? Black people or white people? Black people, you know why?

Because we hate black people too! Everything white people don't like about black people, black people REALLY don't like about black people. There's some shit going on with black people right now. There's a civil war going on with black people, and there's two sides, there's black people and there's niggas. The niggas have got to go

Every time black people wanna have a good time, ignorant-ass niggas fuck it up. Can't do shit! Can't do shit!
Why black folks can't have nothing good going, and if you do best believe it's gon be niggas
I love my black folks, i love being black but i fucking hate these niggas
Mane, niggas get mad bout Trayvon, shoot a kid same age and the same race
Niggas wanna change this shit, but then still do the same thing, don't be mad at me
I love turning up like the next man, don't get me wrong

Some of y'all niggas been turning up for way to long

And i can see it
