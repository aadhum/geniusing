[Verse 1: Quentin Miller]
Old money, new women gotta keep a balance
The girl of your dreams to me is probably not a challenge
I've been counted out so many times, I couldn't count it
OB my brother, me and him go way back Shaq and Penny days
I've been up way too many days but y'all sleeping off of me anyway
Hit my show you leaving with the windy face
I might go Tony Montana and cop me some Shaqs at the free throw - some bricks
, I'm just like these fucking CEOs
I ball like KD
