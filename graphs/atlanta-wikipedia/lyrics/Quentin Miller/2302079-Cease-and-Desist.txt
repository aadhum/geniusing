Miami beach
Dropped from the label and still wasn't faded
Gave these niggas some of the hottest songs of the year and I'm still underrated
And I couldn't care less
Nike store all geared up, ah shit bruh
Isn't that yup you guessed it
Checked up 'til they pay their respects and I rest in peace
Yes you are blessed if you met with me
Think about 2015 without Q.M
No more Mr. Niceguy Quentin Miller
No more love from my side for you niggas
Middle fingers all you niggas get
Try to run off with my swag I send a cease and desist
Million something plays million sold Miller platinum, wow
