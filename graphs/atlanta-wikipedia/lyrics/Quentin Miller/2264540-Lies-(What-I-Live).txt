Wear disguise, tell them lies to be televised
Chasing fame, tryna see yourself among the stars
I'm moving on, don't try me though
You've been warned, Quentin Miller, I'll check to that
These niggas can't hold me back
Five-O, X two, you rapping dudes, I don't get you
Wear disguise, tell them lies to be televised
Chasing fame, tryna see yourself among the stars
Tryna get rich off writtens just like tickets from the lottery
One in a billion chance you win, daddy tryna drive new Benz
I just wanna see you brought up better than I was brought up
I just hope that I could show you, you can be anything you wanna
Without misleading persona, I'm working on it
