My DM poppin'
When it comes to pimping I'm professional
When it comes to Nike I'm professional
Shit ain't the same as last year, I'm a let you know
"Hey Quentin Miller, how much for a feature? How much for a show?" I'll let you know
You all on my line now, you all on my line now
You value my time now, you value my rhymes now, ooh
Nick Miles, Quentin Miller. Thirteen-Seventeen
