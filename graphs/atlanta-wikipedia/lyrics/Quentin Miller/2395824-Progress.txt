You sleep on me by default
It's not your fault
I heard some things that were false
Its' what ya taught
Im 1317, I put on for us all
Tech fleece on edgewood and everywhere else
You all welcome
Fuelbands they couldn't measure
The run
That the boy been on
Living hard knocks serving bars
Living hard knocks serving bars to the stars
Life a size up from medium, living large
I'mma keep a  infinite in my garage
Try not to take it personal
It's strictly business
I'm a legend either way so I'm not offended
Rap game been wrong
I stay in my lane
90's whip no tints on
