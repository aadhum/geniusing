Miss me with that, with that high school shit
With that high school shit
Nigga look what I did, I don't gotta prove shit, I don't gotta prove shit
Nigga look at my bitch
I don't have to pay her bills, she already hood rich
Look how I, look how I live... Brown liquor in the fridge...
Some things you just won't understand...
Time Warner, I got hoes on demand
Comcast, I got hoes on demand
What does that say about me as a man?
Okay, too caught up, two daughters
Hope they never fall in love with a guy like I am
Couldn't settle for the place I was placed inside of
Had to come up out it
I was too unhappy, had to do something 'bout it
You can't do nothing 'bout it
Everybody, but you going off in your project
And you call it your comeback, fuck that
Niggas caught me slippin' once
Now I'm looking out on all fronts
I got different peers, rappers come and go
We see 'em dissapear
It's not a race, it's a marathon
Just give it a year or something
Let me get the game figured out
Come at these niggas brains when I drop
Woah!
