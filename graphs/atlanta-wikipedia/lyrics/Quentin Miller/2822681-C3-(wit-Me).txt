Don’t make me put your card
Don’t think that I’m bluffin’
On accident I’m the topic of discussion
Don’t make me flash my wrist
Fuelband press the button
Even though she was never mine she probably never will be
The couple moments we did have felt so real to me
Even though we never turned in the world we were supposed to be
