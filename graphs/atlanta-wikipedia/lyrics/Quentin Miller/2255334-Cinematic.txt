Cinematic how a nigga living
Cinematic how a nigga living
I used to dream about being famous I'd rather be rich
when I leave the planet
my daughter having some shit
Rather leave a mark in the game before the casket get dipped
See I remain me, you sold your soul and it got you nowhere
Me and you go together so high, so high, so high
HTAL2 told you it was coming
Merry Christmas
New  pretty looking gorgeous in it
I tried to work a nine to five it just wasn't getting it
I started working when I quit that bitch
Now pal I can get that tip
