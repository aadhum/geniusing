Lit behind the wheel I know god got me
She took off all her clothes, it was jaw dropping
Million dollar niggas in my contacts
Yeah, Imma hit you up if you're fucked up
Yeah, please don't let me tell you that I love you no
No, I know nothing in court, I know nothing in court
Woah, Nike all over me now, I don't play none of them sports
OKC, OKC, that boy been bringing the thunder you know it
Lit behind the wheel I know god got me
She took off all her clothes, it was jaw dropping
