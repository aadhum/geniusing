On some spooky dooky shit (spooky dooky)
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You know the one who make ya'll suckers wanna run
The one that make you wanna spend more QT with your son
Nobody that I know no longer do this shit for fun
B-O-O-G-I-E M-A-N
You can catch me in a white DTS with the top popped
Little buddy under my seat
It shoot hot rocks
Make the sucka Po' get loose
Off in Japan they call me Yeti

A straight dog when I'm chasing the platypus
[Andre 3000: Hook]
Touched what I never touched before
Seen what I never seen before
Woke up and seen the sun Sky high, sky high
