Uh, all I wanna do is take all my niggas to Vegas
Buy a pound of weed
and smoke it, get them niggas faded
Yeah and buy some liquor man we gonna get wasted
thanking God I'm single
Yeah, ready to mingle though
I'm trying to slam dunk
we need some fucking trophies
You know that feeling like you won a Superbowl ring (yeah)
We used to rot in Coogi sweaters
now my bank roll larger
Transformer Camaro
hopped out the Dodge Charger
