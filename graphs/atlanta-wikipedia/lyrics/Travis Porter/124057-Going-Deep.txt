Goin deep in it like I'm Roddy White
Leave your old man cause he a peon
Touch dance down like my name Deion
Diamonds on my chain that's Sierra Leone
Hundid' billas' on yo' face
Make a bitch pop shake
No safe, ask "why"
Keep the combo on my waist
Case a nigga hate
Jason style put em' in a lake
got _____ you could live in
But when I put it in your mouth
Don't put your teeth in it
I can't party on an empty stomach, need food
All this jewelry got me shinin’ like a fool
Man fuck the homie Stu, put her in the chair
Big white stones lookin’ clearer than a window
Tote that extendo
Goin deep in that pussy like Im Prime time
