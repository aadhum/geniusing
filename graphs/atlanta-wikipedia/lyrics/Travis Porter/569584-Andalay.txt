A, see me and these niggas ain't the same
I got chain on top of chain
These giusepâ€™s
crazy shoe game
Take the whip, blow the brain
Left pocket got a fisker
Right pocket, mus-tang
Why these niggas talkin' pistol?
They won't shoot it in the rain, Damn
yesterday
counting that skrilla
ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
We ship it out of town, they show up, andalay
ANDALAY, ANDALAY, ANDALAY
And if you got the cash I pull up, andalay
I'm in low, counting money
got them bitches on the molly
yesterday
counting that skrilla, nigga,
I'm a pull up in a mini, probably catch me in a foreign
Windows tinted
, bitches in it
Bow my head and pray the Lord cause He know a nigga sinning
yesterday
