Trinidad
This for all my niggas gettin' money
Dope boy that keep trap bumpin'
Stripper girls can’t wait till Monday (At Magic)
Everybody that keep it one hundred
For my nigga puttin lean in that sprite
For shawty puttin weed in that blunt
Fuck nigga we ball all night
Every day of the week we stunt
Hey look, all my niggas gettin money
Yeah we keep it one hundred
Some niggas scared of that money
I’m racked up and I’m stuntin'
Yeah I keep my hair nappy as hell
But that don’t mean I ain't gettin' no money
Shawty told me pull my pants up
Why you gotta be so damn country
Don't let nappy look fool ya
Don’t make me call in my jeweler
Don’t make me cop a lil rollie
Don"t make me cop a Franck Muller
Don’t make me make a withdraw
We don't fuck with no law (Fuck em!)
Pussy nigga try to rob me and I’ma go upside a nigga jaw
If I take your girl, if I take your girl
Just know she won’t be back
Look at all them funds we throw
Look at all them ones on the floor
I need all my hoes from central station, fuck a boogi bitch
’m in this bitch with my niggas
That's Ali, Strap, and Quez
That’s your bitch I hope not, Cause Instagram where I got her
shame
So them dope boys, my fam man
And that stripper girl my sister
This song for anybody got somebody like that in the system
Lyrical my dick nigga, got hoes licking my dick
And I ain’t changin' for shit (No sir)
Say you country niggas getting your conscious off of my dick
I got a girl in Houston, She always bring me lean
I got a chick from Cali', She always bring me green
Got a bad yellow bitch from Florida
Y'all niggas really couldn't afford her
Okay it's Monday night we at Magic
