I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the floor
You wanna fuck with her you gotta bring yo A game
She work at Magic City all about her change mane
I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the floor
Some Nuvo and some Rose
She fucking underrated, I fuck her till she fainted
One night like in Vegas, I make that bitch look famous
I take her to my kingdom, on that king mattress she lay
I'm a Last King, put my jewels on your face
I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the floor
I let her hit the weed, baby let yo mind go
I like it when she take it down low, down low
Real strippers only do it down low, down low
Baby take it off down low, down low
Then drop it to the floor
