We gon party, have a good time
We’re gonna live our life to the fullest
No regrets, no rewinds
Check your watch, its party time
I got ten minutes to get ready
Got nine bitches on my line
Bumping 8Ball and MJG
Smoke a seven just while I ride
Then I pull up in a six
Give a lil' homie a high five
Then I pull up four
Three, two, one let's go
I ain’t gotta check my watch to know it’s party time
Baby know we party like this all the time
Drinking liquor straight like we done lost our minds
These niggas don't turn me up
Ain't nothin' to but get fucked up
Get on the floor, get turned on
Drink a little more, get fucked up
Get on the floor, get turned on
Drink a little more, get fucked up
Yeah, we got these ladies taking their clothes off
We gonna party party party till it goes off
All we do is party
Travie, turn it up a notch
Swisher Sweets in my pocket
I'mma blow the whole box
Chain gang swanging, hoes in amazement
Now we in the mansions and we came from the basement
365 ho we ball like MJ
18k on a rainy day
But make this fucker jump like a trampoline
Yeah, and if you’re here put your hands up
Fuck it, put your cups up, nigga gonna jump
What what what what
What the hells you talking about?
Man, I’m hungry as a bitch
After party at waffle house
Man, I’m getting plays with my brother MGK
Now we party all day, you might jump up off the stage
What what what what
What the hell are you doing, dawg?
You ain’t a partying like us
And this song might ruin yall
Swishers for the blunts
Puttin' liquor in the punch
Gettin' pretty bitches drunk
And we waking up for lunch
