She won't let me go
She won't let me go
Looked me in my eyes, and told me "baby no"
Spend a night in that pussy and then I gots to go
She tried to hide my keys
Don't want me to go, back out that door
Don't want me to go back on that road
Say I always touch her soul
Say her man don't do her like I do her
Took you off his arm, he ain't on the shit I'm on
Take you to the club, you had the time of your live and drink Patron
Pour you some Rosay and now you drankin', what I'm drankin' on
She won't let me go because I hit that pussy right
All night
And when I hit it, man she keep that pussy tight
That's what I like
