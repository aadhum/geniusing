[Hook]
She got an ass on her, and she pretty in the face
I spend some cash on her,
it ain't nothing to a player
I've been counting money all day all night
Took her from her nigga, had to get his bands up
Packed the whole club, got hoes in the V-I
Put her through college when I'm playing with them dollars
Said the shawty got an ass on her, and it's fat
I'm trying take her home but she rather take care (aight)
I got some bands on her, I put some bands on her
I wonder what she'd do if I put my hands on her
Now where the hoes at?
Now make it clap for me, clap clap for me
Now make it clap for me, clap clap for me
Now make it shake for me, she shake-shake for me
She make it shake for me, shake for me, shake for me
Every time we out to eat you know it's shrimp and steak
She bad to the bone with her hair down the rear-ie
