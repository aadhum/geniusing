She broke my heart and my bank account
Im deep in a trance and I ain't comin out
Put down that lil reggie but she got good sex
Ya, ya thats what Im talkin about
You know I want you baby
You know I need you girl
Before I leave this club tonight
Need me a freaky girl
You, you a sight to see
I ain't even gon' lie
You, you gon' ride with me fuck them other guys
You got me hypnotized them lil things you do
And you got them big thighs with that little bitty waist on you
