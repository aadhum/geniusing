No no, don't act like that
I know I told you I'll be right, right back
As long as you can bring that right back
I'ma give it to you like, like that
Your nails, nails, all on my back
You don't know shawty, I like that
Come on, huh, let me show you how to ride like that
Feet white as cocaina, shawty wet: Aquafina
Know she wanna ride it, I can tell by her demeanor
And me and shawty got a real good vibe
She dripping all down her thighs
Now bitch tell me you can look in my eyes
Sunroof's open, I can see the sky
It’s just something I can’t deny, I hear your body calling me
Wanna be my private dancer, come with me to ecstasy
Pussy so wet, and she ride it like a jet ski
Fly down to Atlanta, shawty get the best of me
All up in the club and she on me
Bottles in the club and they on me
She said that she 'bout it, gon' have to show me
But give me a second so can you hold me?
Uh, don’t act like that, I’ma be right, right back
Like, bring ya' ass over, I’ma hit it from the back
Your nails, nails, all on my back
I love, love, how you throw it back
Then when I try to throw it back like that, like
Then she on top, can you ride like that? (Let’s ride)
Baby girl don’t act like that
What you doing with a back like that
Been on you, the stat like that
And I didn’t know you can bring it back like that
As long as you do it, how you do it when we did it
We can do it, every time when I’m in the city
She fine as hell and don’t know how to act
She said she never did it, never tried
She sitting there telling a motherfucking lie
