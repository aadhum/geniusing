I was riding something playing with the top down
And I’m used to play it loud
I told my girl to pull her top down
Like she was standing in the crowd
Baby I got all this money, and everything you need
If you could please just take your clothes off
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, whoa
That ass bouncing like, oh, oh
Wrist on free oh, when I’m in Orlando
And I’m in this bitch, smoking weed nigga
Please don’t tell my PO
Put a Marley on her tongue, watch her loose it
