I got stacks on top of stacks, my wallet is rubberbands
Slim Dunkin with Waka Flame, cruising in your daughter
I ain't got no time to wait, patience come with time
I might dress this way, but don't take it wrong
What you think they call me Ali for? I'll crack your dome
The whole East Atlanta with me
Breakfast at the Waffle House, twenty sausage biscuits
