Condo on Mars
Louie be on check
Gucci be on check
Hangin' with the models
Damn we ran out
Need to order up more bottles
If you know like I know
Girl you'll leave your man
Cuz when we hit the strip club you know we throw the bands
Okay I just blew a check
Two thousand for my carpet
Oh damn I'm so fresh
A thousand for my outfit
A hundred for the sofa
Five thousand for my fish tank
I know I talk a lot of shit
so excuse me if my breath stank
Ten thousand for the floor
Don't walk in with your shoes on
Just to show I'm gettin' it
I fuck her with my jewels on
My 'fridgerator full
Don't worry 'bout my laundry
Cuz all that shit disposable
Hibachi Grill in the kitchen
Got her cookin' steak
I just take her to the crib
We don't go on dates
Yeah, I got the strippers coming soon
We 'bout to make it rain in my living room
Eating calamari
Nigga I'm the man
Spent a million on my wardrobe
No time for no dumb hoes
Kick them out the condo
I just came from Toronto
What you've got inside your bank account is in my pocket
Young, dumb, blonde chick
Get 10 bands just to appear
Smoking screaming "Travie"
