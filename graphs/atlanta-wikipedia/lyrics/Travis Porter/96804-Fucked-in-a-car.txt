You got your legs on the dashboard
Ya hand on the gas, you're grippin' on the seat belt
My hand on your ass, we breathin' real hard
So we gon fog up the glass
If I start the engine up man I bet we go fast
Now take off
And I ain't never f*cked in the car
Baby can you tell me have you f*cked in the car
I got my keys baby we can f*ck in the car
If I start the engine up girl I bet we go far..
Now take off
Get the rubber on, lets do it
She said strap you stupid
I said with or without music
It's on you let's just get to it
Round and round we go
Gettin' up in side her
It be like we on the stove
Bad b*tch tho, getting head as I drove
She stupid with her throat I'm stupid when I pose
Lock the door, lets go But keep this on the low
You say you can't breathe, well baby breathe slow like..
(Huh huh) slow down then
It's gettin' soft, go down then..
I don't know then baby move down in
Or can you go to round ten
Now that's what I call a great f*ck I caught mine, you caught yours We in the safe spot
