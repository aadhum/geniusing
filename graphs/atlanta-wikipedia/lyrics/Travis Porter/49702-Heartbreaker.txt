Got damn you fine
Now shit done changed, you feeling Strap
Cheese if you want to, but this dick is not yours
Tryna cuff me up, tryna cake up
Please don't put your love in my hand I might drop your heart
I love ya girl, but I ain't your lover
We fucking girl, but we gotta use a rubber
Can't spend the night, cuz I ain't tryna cuddle
And she can't find another nigga like me
So she sprung, sprung, sprung yeah
Can't leave me alone yeah
It's like I shot her down, right in the heart
