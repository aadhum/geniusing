[Verse 1: YG]
It's YG 400
Say she want a balla'
Mustard on the beat ho
She say she want a baller
Fuck once, and never ever call her
She asked why, "Bitch I grew up on the Carter"
Tryna get head 'til I bust like the...?....
Uh, I got her thinking she gone meet Moms
I started this Mac shit nigga Steve Jobs
Yeehaw in a Porsche
Hit the block then I pull up on the porch
Where they do that at?
Smoke a big ass Philly, you gotta light it with a torch
We young niggas smoking that (400!)
He say he the truth but he really not
Cause the summer only time he hot
Yeah, all my niggas...?....
And we do these hoes so scandalous
Nine times outta ten!
That mean we the only ones left
Nigga think different then he's getting pressed
On the set, nigga
Nine times outta ten
Me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whipping in a Beamer or a Benz
Nine times outta ten
Catch me with a bad yellow bitch with a twin
And a dark skinned friend
Nine times outta ten
I'ma make her do a back bend
We gone be up in this bitch until it ends
Nine times outta ten
All my niggas keep something rolled up
You wasn't smoking 'til we showed up, nigga
Nine times outta ten I'm rocking eight, chains
Hopping out the Beamer, partner in the 'Rari
Thick
50,000 in the rubberband thats how we ball
Drop head motherfucker that's the ladies
My life is amazing oh yeah it's picture perfect
threeway
Nine times outta ten
I'm probably pulling up in a Benz
If i fucked her then I probably fucked her friend
Nine times outta ten
Yeah she in love with the swag but they in love with the flow
If I ain't hit her, know my homie fucked up
Layin in the bed butt naked in the Luby's
Started right here then we ended in the 'cuzzi
