Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Shorty won’t let go and she know that I’m the man
She say she wanna dance, hold a puppet in her hand
And I pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
Pop a rubberband, pop a rubberband
And when we hit the club, we don’t go there just to stand
We brought a couple grand, we gon make those bitches dance
And we pop them rubber bands
I know you want these rubber bands, drop it like it’s hot
