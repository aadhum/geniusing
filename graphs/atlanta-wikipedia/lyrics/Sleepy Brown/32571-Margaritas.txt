Five o'clock, but I stopped at 4:59
See it's going down downtown at the lounge
It's definitely crowded with that happy hour crowd
Drinks for a dollar, everybody buzzin' cousin
Spitting like a major league pitcher trying to cut something
I been working all day, now I'm done, so see ya!
It's time for play, name the place I'll meet ya!
We can do the bar, sip margaritas
Stay on the floor, go when we feel right
