Leather in the summer, silk in the winter
Used to sing tenor, in the church choir
Really I was flexin', but the girls they were fire
But even if she was, so what?
Motherfucker grow up; don't mean to be so abrupt
But that lets me, know that she's a human being
And being human's hard, on the boulevard
But I'm Andre, Benjamin Andre to be exact
In fact, Dookie introduced at a show
About a year or so ago, I don't know, mind slips me
I'm in the Southern states, you know, where all the pimps be
Dressin all boogey and carryin' ugly cups
And yes you're getting booed if your shit do not get down
And yes you're getting sued by women who didn't get up
Out their seat on the bus
and feet shouldn't rust
And beat is a must, and we shouldn't lust
But we do
Ascot
Speakerboxxx? Pink and Blue
You're lollygaggin', you're slow pokin'
You got me open, you're playin' wit me, darlin I'm not a toy
As if Anita Baker brings the joy
Your kind are the Tyner, meanin' the real McCoy
Sir Luscious is the real deal, but even he gets antsy
But patience is a virtue
Vision
Just kinky sex up off in the Boom Boom if she want to
And if she don't, then I'll dial another date
