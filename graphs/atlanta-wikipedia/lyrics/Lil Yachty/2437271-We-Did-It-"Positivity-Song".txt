For everybody that said that I wouldn't make it
So for everyone talking down
Anybody who makes you frown
Never take negativity from nobody
Stand tall hold your head high
Stand tall hold your head high
Reach for the sky
I never take negativity from no one
Can't nobody tell you no
Never stop, always go
Head down your own road
Never give a fuck, do it if you want to do it
That's what you gonna do pursue it, just do it
Cause we did it, we did it, we did it
