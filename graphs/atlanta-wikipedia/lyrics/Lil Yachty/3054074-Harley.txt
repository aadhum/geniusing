It's Lil Boat

Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
a
My new bitch a Barbie
And I'm balling so damn hard
Can't nobody guard me, no, no
Late night with the report like Colbert, aye
Love her iced out like a Kid Cuisine
Lil Boat in the magazine
Big bro keep the magazines
Charged up like an Alkaline
Bet she feel dick in her spine
Ridin' like a Harley Harley Harley Harley Harley
18, got the brand new AMG
Right wrist so dipped look like a Frosted Flake
These niggas soft like Life Savers
These niggas be bitches
Most of these niggas be hoes
Guess that that's just how it goes
Ridin' like a Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley
