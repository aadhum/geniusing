All these nat nats
serve up
Pull up on your block and we squirting nines
Using my guap as a face fan
K$upreme, that's my right hand
Right now I'm a Harlem boy but Lil Yachty from Atlantastan
(?) on don't go
Bloody bandana my bros
But cuzzy bandana my woes
Brought my niggas 'round your hoe
Let 'em run train on ya wife
We pass that pussy all night
All these bitches love me like I'm Jesus
