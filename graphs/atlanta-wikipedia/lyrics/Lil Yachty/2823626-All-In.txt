Yeah, yeah, Lil Boat
All my brothers with me!
Yeah
From the start, they been with me from the start
I love y'all!
Gang, gang, gang, gang
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
Seven years later and I got the same friends
All in with a pair of twins in a Benz
She suck me like a push-pop, she love cock
My brothers they been with me from the very start
Recorded in the closet with sock mics
If one fight we all fight, it's fight night
Bankroll after bankroll I spend
Seven years later and I got the same friends
Black and white like a zebra
I don't sell furniture but nigga IKEA
I have an idea, headshot, ID ya
Media wanna see me in jail like Madea
If my career go south I'm going to Sou
It's Byou, nice to meet you
This ain't a cookout but my meat on her grill
I started off like I'm a goonie
When i got in they gave me a toolie
I'm high off these snacks like I'm Scooby
I can't be no average joe
We lettin' you know it's a problem
Grill like I'm eating on pollen
Keep a bitch on my thigh like a pocket
If I fuck her she sucking the gang
Backwood, it's stuffed, look like Oreo
Balmains on me like I'm lonely
Thumb in her butt while she sippin' the Henny
I know that my gang won't forget me
Seven years later and I got the same friends
Old friends call me, say they can't look at Perry the same
Perry growin' up and I got the same gang
now I'm frosted like a cake
JBan$ keep three phones, I'm trapping
Pull off in the Aston, ball like Collin Sexton
diamonds dancing like they Prince
Woah, you just like that glow that's from my neck, yeah
NAZ for life, nigga that's till the end
Ay it's Cartiers all over my lens
All hundreds in my bankroll, I don't do no tens
Never Amount To Zero in this bitch, you understand that?
Same gang, I got the same friends
