I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Beautiful soul with good energy
You put Lil Boat in his zone, I'll never leave you alone
And I fuck with you cause baby girl
You is never running through my phone
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
But trust me when I say Iâ€™m there for you
I know you done been through the pain and the struggle
So baby just let me take care of you
We could double date with Perry
We can make love on a ferry
Buy you the shoes where the heels look like cherries
And when you havin a bad day
I hold you tight, straight through the night
Cheer you up when you be down, we can go run up the town
I stroll through cities, gang they stay with me
But never have I seen someone so pretty like you
Every dream I seem to have is always about you
Yeah Yeah, let me take care of you
We should make, one and one equal two
Don't you fall on me, baby girl
Stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh
Please don't you fall on me, baby girl
Please stand tall for me, baby girl
Don't you evolve on me, baby girl
Oh, oh, oh
You mean it all to me, baby girl
Don't you fall on me, baby girl
Stand tall for me, baby girl
Oh, oh, oh
You don't do nothing
Don't you evolve...
