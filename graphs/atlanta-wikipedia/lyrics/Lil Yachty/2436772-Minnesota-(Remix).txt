You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, riding 'round on boulders
Money sitting up, it sits way above your shoulders
I was eating pork and rinds with a bitch from New York Times
I don't eat no pork and rinds, but that bitch was mighty fine
I rock NBs like I'm Gleeshy
Flip phone banging off the walls, Gucci on my drawers
Why the fuck you in these streets if you scared of them four walls?
I was jugging off them stacks, counting up them racks
Almost had a lifetime sentence, but I beat it, shout out to Pat
Pat, that's my lawyer, he got me off them charges
8 stacks for that boy, he took care of the boy
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
(Migos!)
You need to stay up out the streets if you can't take the heat
When they said Lil Yachty hot, I'm like, "That's him or me?"
Wrist like Minnesota, trapping Coca-Cola
Catching plays, Anquan Boldin
Jug out the hot box, know that it's stolen
Woah, got a bankroll in that big body
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
I love my Motorola, I love my Motorola
Fuck 12, they can't pull me over
Smoking on gas and that odor
Cook it up then flip it over
You must've forgot it, we 'bout it like soldiers
I trap in Minnesota like a viking
Flood out the Sky-Dweller, it got good lighting
We made the dab and all of y'all biting
Cold like Minnesota, racks on fall, I told you
I iced out my Rollie, then did the same damn thing for my brodies
I could put the heat inside the kitchen like a baller
I'm cooking bean on jelly beans
No need to smell it all, is clean
That money talking, Charlie Sheen
I'm riding Ubers with the toolie
I got more diamonds than your jeweler
I make her come back like I'm Yugi
I aim at her head like a sniper rifle
She can't be my bitch if she dyking, dyking
I bought her a ring but no wifey, wifey
She slurp on that dick and I like it, like it
No Nike, she know I do it
I eat that bitch like a hockey pocket
No Nike, she know I do it
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
'Cause it get cold like Minnesota, cold like Minnesota
Cold like Minnesota, it get cold like Minnesota
Need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
You need to stay up out them streets if you can't take the heat
