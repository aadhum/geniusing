I love the way you walk
I love the way you talk
You look ready and you look fine
A Inderpendent girl like you should be mine
Flexing on your niggas just in time
1942 tequila and drinking wine
Keep it 100 with you baby
Not seventy,eighty or even ninety?
You were never stunting til' you met a nigga like me
Stop with the fuss with your exs and come with le
I don't get how you keep it real and true
Not like the other women I've been though
There something about you girl
There something about you girl
There something about you girl thats makes you special
