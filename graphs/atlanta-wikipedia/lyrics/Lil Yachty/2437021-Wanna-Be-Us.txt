Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us, damn
Bitch you know it's Lil Boat
Bitch it's Lil Boat and Lil Perry
I keep them hoes like a ferry
My hair be red like a cherry
All of them niggas they know
All of them niggas they know me
All of them niggas they know us
Them niggas they wanna be us
Shoutout to my nigga Colby
Gold on my neck like a trophy
Lil Boat powered up like a Mophie
Lil Boat that nigga stay low-key
All of these bitches they know me
All of these bitches they on me
That bitch she smile like emoji
That bitch she smile like emoji (woah damn)
I be posted up with Perry
I be counting up the guap
Keep a condom in my sock
Cause these bitches on my cock
I need a mouth full of rocks
And I need me a Rollie
Need a mansion for my brodies
Need my diamonds to be dancin'

Put it in like a finger roll
