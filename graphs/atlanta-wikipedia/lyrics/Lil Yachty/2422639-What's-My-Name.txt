Fingers ashy but the diamonds glisten so it evens out
Pussy nigga know he don't want static

I am a real Ben Franklin fiend
I'm 'bout that bread you feel me
I ain't Jesus I don't got to break bread, this shit mine
I want all that shit
K take his ass like some vitamins
Never give a fuck I'm stuck
Lil Yachty I'm next up
Popping like c4
We working, working like its Christmas time at Walmart

Bitch I ball like a fucking Maverick
What's my name
