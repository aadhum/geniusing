My nigga Ian up in this bitch you feel me
Got 22 bitches on standby they fuck when I say so
Can't talk 'til my case close
don't ash in my whip
Bitch, it's basketball leather
Which nigga you rather it better be me
Maison Margiela just for my black tee
My mouth looking sunny
Me and K Preme beat your ass with our bare fist
24 karat that'll fuck up my teeth
Catch purp get his ass beat
Smoking purp and then I ash it
Don't come to the 6 where it's tragic
And all we smoke is that cabbage
I'mma hot box in the drop top
Now the coupe look like a crock pot
Flyer than an albatross
Rims so above the rim
I'mma catch a body like a cheerleader
I'mma die fly like Aaliyah
R.I.P. I'll see ya when I see ya
40 thousand dollars on the coat
It ain't even cold I'mma call PETA
Whole band on one sneaker
Another band on the other shoe like a nigga on house arrest
Water diamonds jeweler straight from Fiji
If you got a problem nigga don't you tweet me
I'm a real nigga, Lil Boat don't do Hilfiger
15 hundred for a still picture
Saint Laurent, nigga these ain't Jordans
In the air while you niggas boarding
If the cake right I'mma stick a fork in
That Digital Nas something else too
Well, I guess uh, we gon' holla at Yachty a lil bit
He's more emotional you'll see what I'm talking about
