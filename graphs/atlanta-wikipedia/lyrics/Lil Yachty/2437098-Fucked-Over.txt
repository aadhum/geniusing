You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
I ain't got time for no diva
Especially when it came from Pleasers
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
But, fuck you, you fucked me over
You told me before we're over
You gave me the cold shoulder
Now my pockets like boulders
So fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
Fuck you, you fucked me over
