I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
Fuck you so good you be calling out the Christ
Bottles of the Tech got it laid on ice
We spent four seasons at the Four Seasons twice
I can't love no bitch, every single ho is trife
I sip dirty Sprite just to get me through the night
But I need you there
Put that on my gang I swear
I just can't put you on front street like you want I know
It's Yachty from the block you know
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
I know you want this for life
Taking pictures with all my ice
But I can't have no wife
I just want you for the night
