Brrr hey RD man, it's Boat, yeah. Hey man you know that nigga Yachty went on the God damn mornin' show, niggas try to freestyle, niggas tryna act like a nigga ain't got it. Like a nigga ain't still got it, like a nigga ain't really countin' up hundred dollar bills every motherfuckin' day. Like I ain't bossed up bitch!
Stop all that flexin'
Woke up all my niggas like stop all that restin'
Might have my OG comin' do a little pressing
Fuck I look like sippin' beer?
Got so much ice you'd think my jeweler flaked on me, God damn
Hold on, money so old, check his colon
Knot so fat Ben Franklin like who is you foldin'
Just paid cash for a Benz, and Moms, a new Rover
Still the youngest nigga sober
I'm still the king with the crown
King of the teens
I told ya that RD up next
I told you that Boat keep a check
That Yachty could flex, lil bitch
These niggas mad cause that weight, I just skipped it
I had to slow it down cause niggas don't get it
Watch how I do it and watch how I did it
Richer than ever
More wise and more clever
Ball so hard I need a letter, put that on my sweater
26 shit, I dropped that on my wrist
I'm the richest out the group just like Kris Jenner
Fuck on that bitch then I skirt off with spinners in spinners
All of my whips got spinners
That bitch actin' reckless, drop her off in Texas
My plug he like Messi
Empire, no Cookie
My neck is on frozen, Olaf
Never ate the box like RD
Jimmy
I shoot with the semi, one eye like Iâ€™m Fetty
I just bought a bunch of groupies with Groupon
Hey, I keep the chrome in my jeans
Hey, just like a chromosome
All of my whips got spinners
It's Boat from the Sixer,
I'm cut like some scissors
I'm gone off the sizzurp
Then hit on  that back like she bizzurp
I might pull up with sword like I was Link
Pull up with a sword like 21
Hit the strip club and throw Bands just for fun
Lil Boat
