7K for the for VVS, white diamond dentals
I grew up watching Even Stevens
Now Steven ain't nearly as even
But I want to thank you for the entertainment that evening
Yeah, we all laughed at you
'Cause we all know you wouldn't say that if you saw me on your avenue
We all know you aren't built for this shit
I was taught "don't you dare buck if you can't back up your shit"
We got a fallen soldier on the internet
Don't believe my net worth on the Internet
Funkmaster Flex please stop talkin' 'bout me
Unless you're finna play my songs then don't talk about me
Uhm, old man, here's a bar
I hope you fall into a hole where there's no sun or stars
