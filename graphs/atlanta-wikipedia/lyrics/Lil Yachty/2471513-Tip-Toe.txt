I need that Johnny fucking dang
From every ring and every chain
I think I need a new whip
RD
Then polished all my new chains
College ain't for Yachty but I'm going for my mama's sake
Imma hit that hoe 1night then you gone take her on a date
Niggas talking heavy but they easy, bust like stemless grapes
2016 RD gonna be fucking hoes down by the lake
Linking shit like Zelda
so boy respect your elders
I might be younger physically, but mentally I'm older
I'm back again with backwoods
Peter Piper picked a pepper
Niggas drink a little purple and swear to god they so damn trill
Flexing hard I'm Jerry Rice, I'm MVP on every night
Sip dirty Sprite like every night
RIP to A$AP Yams
