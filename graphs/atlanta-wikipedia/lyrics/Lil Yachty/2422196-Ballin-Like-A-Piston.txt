Up late night, bitch I'm feeling like I'm Jimmy Fallon
Flexin' should have been a sport
I done took it all the way
August 23, Mark your calendar, that's RD day
Perfect parts got me so clean
Old ass rappers talking dust, niggas need to die
VVS my whole team
Ballin' like I'm Larry Bird
Youngest nigga ever flexin
stressin
Xans got my body stuck
Leaning I might need a crutch
Got whips like Django
got stripes like a Bengal
