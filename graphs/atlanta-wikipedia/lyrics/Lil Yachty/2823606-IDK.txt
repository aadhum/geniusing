I keep like 6 in my jeans
Oh baby come blow a young fellow like cello
I wanna stuff you then lick you and stick you
Just like a lil rello
I'm too complex, shoulda, called me Marc Ecko
Hunnits all over the floor like rose petals
Bitches come 'round when the stock's up
I give a fuck if you're not us
I give a fuck if you're not us
Ice on my neck cost a Tonka truck
Nut on her face, that's my kids' house
My bitch do white like Scott Storch
Beat up that pussy like Ryu
Pussy so bald just like Caillou
Chrome to his head like Daft Punk
Bro got the gas like a skunk
