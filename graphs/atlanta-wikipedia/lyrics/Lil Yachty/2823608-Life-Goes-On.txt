Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
Had to hit the block when I was 14
Ayy, since I was a young nigga, I knew what I wanted to be
Like Martin I had a dream, like Martin I had a dream
Watch out for 12, might have to move the trap, heard it's a sting
How could I fold? It's nothin' but solid niggas on my team
And we got them racks,
so I can roll up a bag
Niggas broke, niggas leave, just wanna run up and attack
But so long, I'm so gone
Life goes on, life goes on
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do, it do
Life goes on
I swear, I swear it do
I remember bein' broke
Couple dollars in my pocket, I could barely cop a soda
I didn't know what to do
A college kid lost just like everybody else
Up late tryna figure out myself
Mama had no job so I got a 9 to 5
Just when I thought we lost it all
She said, "Boy be strong, God gon' keep us in our home"
You might be down at the moment
But stay there and you'll be up soon
Stay consistent and watch all your money moves
And watch how your old friends hate on you
But fuck 'em because
Life goes on
Well, fuck these bitches, count your money cause you work for it
Life goes on
Backstabbin' niggas, cut 'em off, you'll be fine cause
Life goes on
I know you just lost your job, but stay up cause
Life goes on
