Boat'll hit you so hard, you might think that it's Tekken
And I just talked to Sid and he said that the TEC in
I ain't talkin' 'bout no game when I say that the TEC in
I would plot on me too if I lived life like you
Young bitch, I ball like a Cavalier
I got my first M and bought my moms a car
I'm cold, Minnesota
