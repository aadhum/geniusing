If ya'll niggas ain't talkin' about money don't talk to me
When I pull out this nine watch how fast his realness expire
I ball like Sean Kemp
Surrounded by bad bitches, I thank god for all my bitches
Without all my bitches I would probably still have bitches
Pocket full of pintos, different color like some Mentos
I miss my brother Jimmy, biggest influence to me
STYC
I see why these niggas mad cause I got all the hoes
