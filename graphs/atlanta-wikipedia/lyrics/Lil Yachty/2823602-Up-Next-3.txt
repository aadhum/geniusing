Aye, Chris Fresh, Lil Boat, Chris Fresh, Lil Boat
Yeah and I'm tired of all you pussy ass niggas hatin' on boat cause y'all see that nigga shinin'
Y'all see that nigga stuntin'
Y'all see that nigga up next nigga
Fuck y'all niggas, uh
And my new bitch, she a model from Africa
Any fine bitch with an ass, boy im' after ya
22 diamonds, they shine like a brand new dime that you flip for a bet
Stay with the Tec, gotta check on my neck
Fuck you pussies bitch I skipped bein' rookie
Nigga play hooky when they see it's Boat time
Ice on my wrist got you thinkin' it's cold time
I spent a whole six up in Dover
Why'd u even bother? I'm richer I'm better
26 shit, I dropped it on my sweater
Just cause it's real leather, Versace my feathers
King sized set with the pillows
Knot so fat like a fuckin' burrito
Never fuck none of these hoes without rubbers
Aye, Lil Boat, QC, what up?
150 DT, gang-gang, gang-gang, gang-gang, aye
Bitch it's G Herbo, swervin' so much
Watch them start callin' me Swervo
Killas like Marlo
Come to your block, shoot it up with no sorrows
Maison Like Capo,
Rollie a Beamer, my bracelet a Tahoe
Riding an i8s in a race through Chicago
Blunts full of pasto
free bands like Rocko
My life is so trill, I made a name off my block like I'm O'Neal
500 deep, got the ops hidin' for years
Pop out, go trill
Glock color oatmeal
Know what I mean, bitch it's brown, it ain't no steel
Ridin', we lurkin', you better keep your steel
You gotta be ready to use it in broad day
You know little bro will
shout out Coach
Lil Boat
