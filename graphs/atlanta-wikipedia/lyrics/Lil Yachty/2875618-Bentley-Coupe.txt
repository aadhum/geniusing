(Absolutely)
Way too much sauce, I'm like Uzi, Uzi
Water drippin', I'm jacuzzi, 'cuzzi
I think I'm in love like Choosey Susie
Me and Lil Yachty in Nautica (Nautica)
Polar bear, Gucci, Antarctica (BRRR!)
20 chains on like Mardi Gras
So many Rollies, got my brother one
I raised you lil' boys, you my other sons
Now my money sittin' tall on giraffe shit
Shout out them Southside bloods in Jurassic
your money short like an interlude (lil' money!)
They look at boy like he the holy trinity
Yeah and I ball when I rap like I'm Master P
