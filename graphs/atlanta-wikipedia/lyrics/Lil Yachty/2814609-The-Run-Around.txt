I been flexing since the 90’s
ot a bad bitch, she grind me
All my bitches acting fancy
I got bitches in the hood
I got niggas in Decatur
It might be your next door neighbor
I’m tired of doing niggas favors
I can’t fuck with all you haters
Lowkey I might run for mayor
Lowkey I could be a Laker
I been ballin’ like a Pacer
I be looking like a crystal
like [?]
I been sexy since the 90’s
VVS’s in my timepiece
Chopper hold a hundred rounds
Sippin’ Act make the pain go away
Always Ben Franklin, my chopper gon’ sang
25 for my fucking arm
