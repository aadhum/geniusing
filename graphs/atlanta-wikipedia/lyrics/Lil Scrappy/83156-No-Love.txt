Yeah, ah, so we fighting, fucking then we loving
In the AM maybe we'll be nothing
And you say you like that real thugging
Confused flow, for real though
Love came through the front
Went out the back door
Can't
Believe you love me, cause your feelings are funny
[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here
My heart on broken, confidence stolen
Mind going crazy, should I stay or keep going
She don't love me, well I gotta embrace it
If I don't love her, baby girl you gotta face it
The thang about love you can't find it you neither trace it
If love was a test, you either fail or you ace it
Love me, for who I am
If not, shit I don't give a damn
You want the cars, house and designer things
I get it baby girl, you want the finer things
And I ain't hatin on you, go and get it now
Matter fact, go and get it Now, matter fact make daddy proud
Erythang change when you say the L word
Cause I can't say it back I don't know what to tell her
You say what is love, it's a powerful word
And it's more than great, man that shit can hurt
Don't wanna fall cause
I can't let another one in
