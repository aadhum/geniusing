Zone 3, Aye!!
2-4-5
Gotta charga on the boost, baby girl you wann' ride?
Yea dat's me, tinted out ridin' durrty
BME motherfucker
Show you the meanin' of ash to ash, is just a dust
If you laid back in the 'Lac
I dunno If them hatas gon' handle dat
Yea, all the young ladies call me +Get It Mayn'+
You can see the phat stacks off, in my pants
Guerilla Unit motherfucker
What cha lookin' at? - Yee'in hard like granite!
Knock you off ya balance, if ya ass try to challenge
I hit the mall by my self, the hood by my self
When I'm in L.A. I rock the Kakhi's with the belt
I'm so gangsta - I eat the cereal without the milk
Make my grill look good with the 45 stack
[Verse 3: Lil Scrappy]
Got the white walls on the Old School
G' mode
All up in the club with my pockets on swole
I was born in the A, raised in the A
Gotta couple of war wounds on the gangsta face
