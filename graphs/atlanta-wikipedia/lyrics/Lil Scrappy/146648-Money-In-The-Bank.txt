I'mma get that, dough and fuck with dem, hoes
Young ladies that know me know Scrappy's a, pro
Find me a couple we can make it a, me-nage
You be tryin, hard but nigga don't, start
You be doin shit is gon' get you to the, morgue
I be pullin out knots, that can buy me a, yacht
Hold on baby, please, go get on yo', knees
If you don't do it for me then do it for the, cheese (yea)
I got extra weed (yea) money long like sleeves (yea)
If a nigga try to creep, I got extra heat
Got a bank account (cha-ching) with a large amount
If a nigga wanna talk, nigga we can let it bounce (bounce)
Take it outside, nigga fuck fallin back
Two step with me, let me show you how it goes
The Murcielago, lemme show you how it rolls
I got a Bentley that I only drove one time
50 bought it for me shorty but it's still mine
My Chevy clean and the paint look like lemon-lime
You wanna shine, it ain't hard, just get on your grind
We keep a bankroll
She said she like the way I talk, these hoes love me
Club goin crazy, we throwin out stacks
See I'm A-Town stompin in a A-Town hat
But I'm reppin Tennessee, like my homey Project Pat
It ain't 'bout where you from homeboy it's where you at
