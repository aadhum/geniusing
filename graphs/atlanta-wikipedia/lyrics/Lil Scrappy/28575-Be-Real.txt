If you a thug my nigga be a thug
If you sell drugs my nigga then sell drugs
If you gonna rap about it be trill about it
And dont say shit if you can't BE REAL about it
Comin up as a child all I seen was Hell
Then went from a half to sellin ten O's
Nobody loves me so I guess I stay to myself
A nigga thankin 'bout change contemplatin my death
Feel my pain as it rains all over a nigga
And the only way I can get away is weed and liquor
Fuckin niggas up on the daily if they didn't pay me
Niggas pullin guns on me damn near drove me crazy
A product of hard times, I spit hard rhymes
