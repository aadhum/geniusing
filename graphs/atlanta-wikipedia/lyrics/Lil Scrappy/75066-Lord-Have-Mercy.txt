B.M.E
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
Dear lord, this a letter to you
A young nigga hurt and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards hatin
It's like everywere I go I run into satan
Im on this earth, with my blessing and my curse
Just thinking that how we live
The ridin hurts
Even though you know me
Ever since I was birth
I'm innocent till you judge me and that comes first
And I ain't trying to burn lord cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding on the rock for the thirst
I knew it was wrong got to snatching the purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt
Yeah I wanna go to church
But I can't be faithful
I'm always doing shows but you know that I'm grateful
I turn weak for the fruit cause it be tasteful
I dunno how in the world I can ever repay you
Dear lord I thank you for looking out for my fam
Helping my little brother who don't give a damn
You see my little sister done got pregnant
And my moma acting crazy it ain't changin'
And I pray, that you keep my pops preachin'
Cause if he ain't around ther's nobody teachin'
And please keep my baby mama from bitchin
Excuse my language lord but it's always friction
I wanna thank you for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
Cause I swear on you if they touch my kid
I'mma be sittin down writing to you again
