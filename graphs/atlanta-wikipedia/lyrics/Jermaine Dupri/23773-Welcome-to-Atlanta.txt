Welcome to Atlanta
vogues
adolescent packin a fo
who did it?, it was me I suppose
JD in the Rolls and Luda's in the Cut Supreme
Skatin down Old Nat
gat tucked and leaned
I split ya spleen
I get the cream
cops see me flick my beams
I'm allergic so doc' prescribed antihistamines
Oink oink, pig pig, do away with the pork
Only silverware I needs a steak knife and a fork
Did you forget your fuckin manners, I'm Bruce with Banners
Ludacris, Johnny Rockets when I shoot the cannon
The wooly mammoth sabretooth, bitch bite your tongue
I won't stop until I'm rich as them whites'll come
I pulled up in the black Lotus, your plaques are bogus
Waitin for my cue to corner pocket eight balls, you rackin 'em up
I'm big paper like pancakes, stackin 'em up
In fact I'm slappin 'em up, Cadallac'n the truck
I can't loose with twenty-two, bitch that's what's up
Welcome to Atlanta where the players play
And we ride on dem thangs like ev-ery day
Big beats, hit streets, see gangsters roamin
And parties dont stop 'til eight in the mo'nin
Now the party don't start 'til I walk in
But in the meantime, in between time
I been puttin it down here since eighty-three
Since the Lakeshore/MD rivalry
If you was ridin, you was bumping to homie Shy-D
Make my own rules, bitch call me the mayor
Tuesday night, I'm up in the Velvet Room, gettin fucked up
Wednesday, I'm at Strokers on lean
Kream
Shark Bar,
Kaya with Frank Ski
Saturday, is off the heezy fo' sheezy
You can find me up in One-Tweezy
Sunday, is when I get my sleep in
Cause on Monday we be at it again, holla!
