[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat (x2)]
I say
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
Uh, I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine
One thing's for certain, when you see her, you see me
We in this bitch like the 2016 EPMD
And So So Def is the reason, I don't work no 9 to 5 bitch
I don't even know what that is
Now what this is, is that Snoop and Dre, mixed with UGK
When the two of us get together, there's no more playin', GA
[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
I say
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
Uh, I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine
[Chorus: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
Nigga you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your lil sister go harder than mine
I say
Bitch you must be out yo motherfuckin' mind
If you think your big brother go harder than mine
