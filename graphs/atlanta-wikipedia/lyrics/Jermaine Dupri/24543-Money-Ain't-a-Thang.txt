[Hook: Jermaine Dupri and Jay-Z]
In the Ferrari or Jaguar, switchin' four lanes
With the top down screamin out, money ain't a thang
Bubble hard
Trying to stay alive, hundred thou' for the bracelet
Foolish, ain't I? The chain'll strain ya eye
Willies wanna rub shoulders, your money's too young
See me when it gets older, ya bank account grow up
Mine's is one-zero-zero-zero-oh-doub'
Damn near out the rear trunk when I roll up
Multi til I close up, it's all basic
I been spending hundreds since they had small faces
Take small groups, turn them into big names
I'm "The Truth" like A.I.
Know why? Cause I write the songs that the whole world sing
Said she loved my necklace, started relaxing
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction!
Baby, I don't play all my jewelry is light grey
Platinum, spend your whole life in the day
So what you went gold and rock a Roley with the ice bezel?
It's gon' take a lot mo' to see my level
