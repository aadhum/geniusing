Puttin niggas outta business like Sony did to Zenith
I got the hots like the Lox - Money, Power and Respect
Nigga, wit more glitta, than M.J
My dogs wanna hang (bark)
My bitches wanna bang
But it don't mean a thang
When all you got is change
That's why my women ain't dimes
Not even close to nines
Sorta like fives and sixes
Wit scars and stiches
Type of bitches that spit in yo' face like Alomar
Niggas goin' to parties
Thousand dollar shoes and jewels
You Begets what I be wantin' so I be bringin' the tool
Tryin' to snatch up all that ice that you came in
An' I'm gon' rip till I'm stiff like wood
Darkman, Motherfuckin X shit
