After the party it's the Waffle House
If you ever been here you know what I'm talkin about
Where people don't dance all they do is this
And after the original you know what it is
Welcome to Atlanta
I got somethin' else to tell you 'bout the new Motown
Where people don't visit, they move out here
And ain't no tellin' who you might see up in Lenox Square
I don't know about you but I miss the Freaknik
People from other cities used to drive for miles
Just to come to get a taste of this A.T.L style
I'm the M.B.P., Most Ballinest Player
Magic sittin'
Velvet Room
Strokers
Cause they don't know how to treat you when you come through the do'
the fuel
And I be up in the booth drunk actin a fool
One Tweezy
Ayo, I'm from New York man!
Representin' N.Y.C. to the fullest
I pull it, Heads be duckin in New York be bussin
Take that
Welcome To New York motherfuckers, where we don't play
And out of towners get got like everyday
And a gangstas a gangsta in every way
Sittin' low on 22's; this what long money do
Tell Flex to run it back and drop a bomb on it
Sunday we layin' low at Halo, sippin' Cris and we straight
Monday we go to Bungalow 8
You can spot us out of town by the way that we walk
The way that we talk, cocky the state of New York
Rucker's game
New coupe, no roof playa, what's my name?
New York, if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere
And we buildin' four more new towers!
Who say St. Louis ain't hip hop? Dirty we hop to what's hip
lunatic
I'm so St. Louis, ask my tatooist
I was like "The Waterboy," now they sayin, "YOU CAN DO IT!"
Sip Louie
dressed in Louis
air forces
Old school cars be trailblazin' like Portland
The girls are the best like Travis with fat asses
I call 'em gimme girls they always tell me I can have it
truth like Sojourner
Don't need a burner we learn from Ike Turner
don't cross that bridge
Without permission from the St. Lunatics
Ladies and gentlemen, we got the big Snoop Dogg in the house tonight
He just came from off tour
And he wanna tell y'all little bit where he come from
Like Kobe to Shaq now take that
Long Beach is on the mother fuckin map
JD, you know about the L.B.C
My niggas love the Steelers
Bang diggy dang dang Dogg Pound Gangsta Crip Gang
