You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
Feel like I've been here forever
And it ain't all bout glame and glisten cause I'm a treasure
I have done counted so much cans that my hands are sore
You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
I'm sleeping on Grandma floor nigga
With my blow nigga
I'm TTGG train to go get it
I got to go hard by all means
I go berserk by all means
You get treated like royalty
When you freeband loyalty
We got A 1 bitches on the team
And they gone treat you like a God when you part of my squad
A gang of shooters in my entourage
