The luxury of having passion
I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal
Hunnas on hunnas, do numbers on numbers
Get llamas on llamas
Got bales by the bundle
Got hunters that's gone, there's a hun' in the joint
That's a hundred on hundred
Trapped out the house with my partners
We went to shoppin' on midget
We went to cop it and get it, take flights out the city
We go to AZ and send it
We go to AZ and get it
I'm hungry, I admit it, I swear I'm conditioned
I served and I hustled on any conditions
Fuck your permission, I'll get to them digits
Hop out the 'Lac on some pimpin'
Step to that bitch like I'm Goldie
Half of these niggas? they bogus
Most of these niggas? they bogus
I hit the lights for roaches just to scatter
I seen these bitches dancin' with the devil
I seen that money make a bitch evil
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal
I fell in love with a kickstand
I serve that bitch with my left hand
I'm 'bout to open a meth lab
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
This shit gettin' colossal
We trap out the traphouse
We love it, we gettin' that money
We trap out the traphouse
Just know that we love it, we gettin' that money
This shit gettin' colossal
I seen that money make a bitch evil (money make a bitch evil)
I seen that money make a bitch evil
