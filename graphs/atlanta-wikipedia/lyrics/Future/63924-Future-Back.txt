I should be with Big Meech, I get so much money
finessin'
Do not touch it, if it ain't them bands
smashin' on these pink toes
More paper than Kinkos
Drinkin' lean and its heavy
We throwin' money on these hoes and they ain't even dancin'
And its coming back white, Marlyn Manson
Yo main dame, thats my secretary
weary
astronaut pluto,
