Really I'm a mothafuckin' drug dealer
Smoke me a blunt with some Blood niggas
I don't do no old whips
But I will fuck my old bitch
Done 'em down, don't spare that nigga
Catch him now, then air that nigga
Catch him down, then air that nigga
Sell some pounds with my migos and them
Then I go fuck on your bitch
I'ma just give her some star status
My niggas like to drink syrup and serve dog food
I had to get my bag together 'fore I called you
Aye, stand on the corner a thousand days
Flippin' the money a thousand ways
Workin' and workin' for better days
Aquafina in my watch, oh yeah
Got some Aquafina in my watch, oh yeah
That's a new Dominican, some Fiji pussy
That's that water, water, make me eat that pussy
I'm a self-made nigga, keep on lookin'
I'm a self-paid nigga, keep on lookin'
Man these goon niggas like the secret service
Hot boys, we go warfare
We some hot boys, we want warfare
Hot boys, we go warfare
We some hot boys, we want warfare
[Outro: Ebro Darden & Future]
