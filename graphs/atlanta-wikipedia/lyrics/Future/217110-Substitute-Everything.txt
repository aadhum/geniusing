I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
Today I took a Xanny, I started missin family
I don't see them as much, I know they feel abandoned
I'm workin 'til I pass out and now I understand it
Roll up the kush, and let’s get high, and take you to a galaxy
See I just wanna be in my zone, where nothin' bothers me
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
I believe hard times made me like this
I don’t leave the studio, I like making hits
There’s broken relationships that I can’t fix
I got bad habits I picked up, I can't kick
I need my herb, I need my syrup
Now I'm free like a bird
I make a lot of mill's, I had to pop a pill
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
This bitch filed for child-support like I don’t take care of my child
She want them stacks I got on me, she wanna see me down
I had to take a molly, it lift me off the ground
I watch my dreams come true, I wish my granddad see me now (rest in peace)
I'm tryin to keep everybody happy, bring in the scripts
Everything calm and collective when I'm smoking on sess
I'm takin pain pills, I'm takin pain pills (why?)
Wish a nigga take away the pain
I'm sippin' codeine, I'm sippin' codeine (why you sippin'?)
Wishin' I could slow down fame
