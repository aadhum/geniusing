I get mad zooted, I got this bad thing I recruited
I stay on Miley Cyrus, every where I go I'm screwed up
I know my Texas niggas got my back and that's for sure though
Easter Pink
Tangueray
I gave her realness, and thatâ€™s all she gonna get from me
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good
Treasure bring misery,
I pulled up in a big B, swerving like a hippie
Copping a couple cakes and the drum hanging under me
The young niggas under me they gon' stand up in any war
Who built this shit ground up? At the head of a seminar
I talk for the real ones, I talk for them niggas
They feel this shit out in Belgium
Freeband Gang
I just did a dose of percocet with some strippers
I just poured this lean in my cup like it's liquor
I just need a whole lot of drugs in my system
I just tried acid for the first time, I feel good
