Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more
wearin' designer galore
ain't no Fugazzi
Went from getting a house bust to bustin' a stadium
Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more
wearin' designer galore
I never lost faith,
Went from sellin' yay (so what?)
To sellin' verses (true story!)
100 million dollars is my only damn purpose
Getting to the money, hustle like I ain't got no money
Even if I fall, I'm gonna land on a bed of hundreds
I swear to Lord, I just left the bank
Hungry for more
wearin' designer galore
