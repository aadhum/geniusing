I’m moving on, I’m moving on
I can’t believe how many times she called my phone
She love my style so when she shop, she let me do the dressing
been some years since I’ve seen her
I know I’m coming there and hey, I might need her
I can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her
Can’t believe it came a day I’m waving bye to her
