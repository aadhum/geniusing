Turn it up a notch for the city
Gotta get that money like the 80's and save it
We went through the struggle and waited, and made it
I get exhausted off the red until I say 'uh oh'
Carbon 15, don't you take it personal
California dreams every single day we know
Order that car and an Audemars
bales joints
Gotta get that money like the 80's and save it
We went through the struggle and waited, and waited
I get exhausted off the red until I say 'uh oh'
A hundred round magazine, don't take it personal
So many foreign broads, and they all want that revenue
Saucy, drippin' off me, got designer drippin' off me, yeah
Fucking thottys is a no-no
Gotta get that money like the 80's and save it
We went through the struggle and waited, and waited
I get exhausted off the red until I say 'uh oh'
