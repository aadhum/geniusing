I just popped open a seal, I’m on X
Lil’ shawty sittin' at Blue Flame, sent me a text
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
I float off Earth, always float off Earth
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy, ohh
I don’t walk on land, bitch I don’t ever walk on land
George Jetson, you can’t see me noooo
Do numbers like Boston George on Vimeo
I left that bih cause she was sleezy, ohh
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy
She ain’t runnin’ out of flavor, I went to ice her
We do a whole lotta numbers, yeah
Grab on that pussy like Donald
I can’t get caught with my hands down
I can’t be comin', my man’s down
Better not get caught with your hand down
Better not get caught with your hand down
Diamonds doing the Chris Breezy, ohh
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu
Super Fuuuuuuu
