Freebandz Sunny in this motherfucker
Original Black Migo gang
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I got my chains on, they like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbine
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Reincarnated Makaveli
Presidential with a bezzy
And I'm sharper than a machete
Takin' the codeine, it's red
I shake it up in a Tahiti
They ran out of singles, I'm throwin' up hundreds
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I got my chains on, they like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbine
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
Don't make me go and get the Wraith
I'm tryna dodge another case
I keep a pack of wolves by the safe
I rob the bank, I'm goin' on a chase
I got my chains on, they like lasers
And you gon' make me go and get the carbine
They ran out of red, I'm drinkin' on yellow
