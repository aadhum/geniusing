Is that her in the VIP line?
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she drive a Beamer
I don’t want ‘er cause she from the corner
And I don’t even drink Corona’s, what type of drink you want bruh
on dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me
If you wanna live better, we can buy a crib wherever
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see ‘er ‘fore I do tell ‘er I wish that I met ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I asked her is it true and she said like a horseshoe
She got that, got that name covered, that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like vroooom
[Hook: Future]
Turn on the lights! I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
Turn on the lights! I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her...
[Lil Wayne]
Tell her I skate
And shawty down the earth, but bitch I need my space
And she gone ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give a Santa Claus face
We gon' turn up tonight
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
Now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we both were single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
And she got that nigga's name covered like a war wound
Tell her I skate
I ain't go no Worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Tunechi
tell 'em I'm straight
Tunechi...
Tell her I been lookin' for her wit a flashlight
Tell her if she honest she promise she stay true
Make sure, when you tell her, tell her we goin' past the moon
