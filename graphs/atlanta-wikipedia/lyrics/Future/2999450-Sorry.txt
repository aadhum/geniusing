Yeah, ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be this way
Ain't mean to try to desert you
Sorry, tryna be this way
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't mean to desert you
Sorry that it looks that way
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Ain't really mean to hurt you
Ain't really tryna hurt you
Sorry it's gotta be that way
Ain't really tryin'
I ain't really tryin'
I was in the U.K. thinkin', shit don't feel the same
Addy got me daydreamin', hope I ain't goin' insane
Tryna find a PYT, I already got some at home
Gotta drink my blood like a Hebrew
'Cause I've been gettin' fly, since Evisu
I can get you off in Belgium
Sold crack to a pregnant lady
Forgive me for the crack baby
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Paid for my mistakes like a drug deal
Cash rules everything around music
The game doped up, every nigga usin'
V12 motors
Tryna identify, you look sketchy
Hot tenderoni, Bobby Brown ooh
Child is so phony, I got somethin' to prove
Money stand up and it got me seduced
I hit the lotto in South Africano
Asian persuasion, Cubana, mi ana
Yolanda, Sholanda, Miyana, Mufasa
I don't know Spanish, I barely talk proper
King like Mufasa, messiah, then higher
Shout out my woadie, he smashin' the C.O
my watch in an igloo
man chains is on Fiji
Kidnapped
Diamonds on sight is way brighter than Geezy
got goonies on speedy
Armani on me, you never warned me
How can you blame us when we all out the trenches?
Gold chains and rings, they're so easily gettin' offended
I hit my first model, stepped up my pimpin'
