We some space cadets, keep a stupid ass check
In designer specks
I'ma rockstar, yeah nigga outta space
I'ma rockstar, hell yeah I'm outta space
Rockstar outta space penthouse hideaway
Fountain blue getaway King of Diamonds where I lay
Lamborghini doors suicide open up your brains now your casket closed
In designer specs, on my face show respect
I'm drinking on dirty my wrist cost a 30 my chain in the
Ocean I'm floatin' & rollin
Benjamin's in my rack's put spikes on my converse
I thumb through a crazy check, I keep me a dumb check
