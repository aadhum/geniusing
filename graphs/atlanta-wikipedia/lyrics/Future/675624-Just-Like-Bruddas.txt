I gotta kick this flavor, ya hear me
Chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it up, pose for a Freeband President
while I'm counting up these Presidents
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so po'd up
Chewing on the bars, and we call 'em barbarian
I'm on my way to Mars, got the stars in the ceiling
Down South Georgia, boy
We the New Chopper City, we the New Chopper City
We the New Chopper City, yeah
(Free B.G.)
Lights out, hotwire me a Eddie Bauer
And I went and got it poppin', and I let them bullets shower
Chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it up, pose for a Freeband President
while I'm counting up these Presidents
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so po'd up
Off 2 milligrams, I forgot about my ex-ho
Staying with the gas, fill my blunts up with petrol
Pop a couple double G's and down it with some XO
Trippin' off them bars you forgot when you was dead broke
Down five Xanax and I pray I wake up and forget
I been with the gang cause they love me how I am
Shit ain't been the same, they talkin' bout me on the 'gram
They say I turned my back on my baby mama, I'm on them tabs
And my hood looking up to me, I love them niggas to death
Chewing on bars, then they call you barbarian
All I see is stars, fly a bitch out from Maryland
Cooking up dope, got more fish than aquarium
Bend it up, pose for a Freeband President
while I'm counting up these Presidents
Riding 'round with a two-liter, I'm so po'd up
