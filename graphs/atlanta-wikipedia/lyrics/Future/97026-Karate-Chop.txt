Slang a bunch of narcotics
Livin' like John Gotti
Choppin' bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serve it to the dope fiends
Blowin' money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billie Jean
[Verse 1: Future]
Got a Panamera round a young nigga neck
You can hit a nigga line, order what you want
pulling up a donk
Pop a ace of spade bottle,
sip a lot of syrup
Whipping up a cake,
Young nigga play with ki's, (ki's) like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
Nigga where you at, (at) nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from two and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
I can get 36 for a clean shirt
Beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Pull up, serve you in my Rari'
Frank Matthews
Killers around me like I'm Gotti
If I tricked you, know Im sorry
I be geeking on them mollies
Sell remix dont sell no cleans
My hand like a triple beam
I got workers like machine
All I do is sell dreams
Half my niggas serve fiends
I get up and then I lean
