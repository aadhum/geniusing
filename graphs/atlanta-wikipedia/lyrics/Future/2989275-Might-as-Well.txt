So I ain’t have to scheme
Rawest diamonds on my team
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Either way it goes
We buyin’ out the stores (for real)
We ain’t never runnin’ out of lean, (never)
Might as well go on ‘n pour it
Racks bustin’ out of niggas’ jeans (fuck)
Might as well go and blow it (fact)
Smoke the loud like nicotine (smoke)
Talk drugs and I record it (let's go)
Percocets got me goin’
OG, coughing up a lung
bitch
I'm know I'm blessed to speak in tongues
My words touch a nigga soul
I ride the boats in the ocean (woah)
I whipped the car, it was stolen
I got the stars on the ceiling
I got my charge acquitted
I was the one got evicted,
Living with the pink slip
Now I'm ridin' with the pink slip
Nigga came from the deep end
I was selling crack when Snoop dropped “Juice and Gin” (yah yah)
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
OG, coughing up a lung
Child support gettin' heavy
It’s hard not to get offended
Oh, you maxin' out your credit card?
Like it wasn’t hard for me
I just bought a new Bugatti for you
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
Packin’ no luggage, when I get down, buy the mall
I took off just like a Rocket (I’m gone)
Olajuwon, Hakeem
