You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I cook me one I cook up a half a key
You shouldn't've shown me dat recipe
Now every time I buy a car I trick it out with the fee
You should've left me inna blind
You should've left me Ray Charles
You shouldn't've never let me get on the track with the Drum Squad
You shouldn't've never let me whip it, turn myself to a star
You shouldn't've never let my buy the Benz and get it fully loaded
After I leave the dealership I'mma go see Johnny Dang
I got a house full of Jacksons like my name Tito
saw my first hundred thou' and it did something to me mentally
I'm that same nigga from Castalia remember me ?
Shouldn't've shown me the game cause now it ain't no looking back
Call my socket
Got a sack
Cop a drop and park it in the hood and make that right back
