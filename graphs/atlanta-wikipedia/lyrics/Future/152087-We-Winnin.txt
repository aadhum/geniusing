Winter summer spring fall, I'ma change wardrobes
Gotta straighten out your stacks when them stacks won't fold ayy
I go to Pluto, that's a sign that my ice all real
We poppin' bottles every day like its a brand new year
Winter summer spring fall, I'ma change wardrobes
Gotta straighten out your stacks when them stacks won't fold ayy
Lifeless, I fucked her fifty thousand on the bentley
Remix you can't even see it when you get it
Winter summer spring fall, I'ma change wardrobes
Gotta straighten out your stacks when them stacks won't fold ayy
Keep a mac like a computer you lil niggas ain't sleak
Winter summer spring fall, I'ma change wardrobes
Gotta straighten out your stacks when them stacks won't fold ayy
