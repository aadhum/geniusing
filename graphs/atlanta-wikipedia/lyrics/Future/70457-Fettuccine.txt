I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, now I spend it quick
Ain't fuck up on the cash with my bitch
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, I got that fettuccine
I got that fettuccine on me, now I spend it quick
Order up that Lambo, put me on the list
Order up the Lamborghini, put me on the list
I got that fettuccine on me, tell me what you see
Givenchy
menage a trois,
I sell it all, he mail it all
Slow gift wrap, need a Christmas card
You niggas hating
I'm lifting off in private jets
We peeling out
In them Porsche Panameras that we wheeling out
I look a bitch in her ass 'fore I look a bitch in her eye
I see the bitch in y'all swag, I give a fuck if y'all fly
I'm cheap though
I'm staying paid, I'mma make it rain
And I'mma take the train, I'm Latino,
got razor blades
Okay chico but it ain't to shave,
I got pesos, I got pesos
