Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
Oh yeah
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
I might end up with your hoe if I take one
Nowdays if they don't have a story, they gon' make one
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones
'Cause nowdays if they don't got it they'll make one
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe (still c...)
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am?
Make me fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz (Freebandz)
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' (he was sayin')
You turned your back, I shouldn't have ever gave you a chance (gave you a chance)
I got four lawyer fees, shit ain't ever end
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Be honest to me
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
Still comin' out strong
