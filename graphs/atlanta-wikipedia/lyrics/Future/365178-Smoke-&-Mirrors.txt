Don't believe what they tell you Smoke and Mirrors!!
Half that shit they sell you Smoke and Mirrors!!
You know you gotta hit Smoke and Mirror!!
You niggas can't be serious
They gas you up like AMACO and fill your head with lies
You need to cut em off immediately they not good for you
They rather see you fall
They don't wanna see you ball
Put the picture in the media bout the drama
Don't know heart or work it took from them summers
Now they wanna add you on Twitter like they yo kin
(WHAT THE FUCK GOING ON)
Nigga I know you ain't my friend
I'm drinkin' on some Actavis and I swear I taste like grapes (Lean)
Every City, every gurl a kissin' baby, hugging mothers
Them old folks they fuck with Future like they young again
