Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath
They come out Charlie Sheen (winning)
Man we need a mask
All these dope fumes (don't sniff)
You need some gambino
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath
My life is a marathon
Cause I'm on the paper chase
My aunty say what's that smell
She said it is smellin' sour
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath
She bring me a cash money
Like Nipsey and Marathon
Yeah I'm on juuga-thon
I can't stop counting up
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath, and if they come out clean
When them birds take a bath
watch it come out green
Let them birds take a bath
