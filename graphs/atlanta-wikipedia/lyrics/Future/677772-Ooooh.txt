I told that nigga I'll get that pop star
caca
Doin' donuts at 200, ooooh
I'm smokin' 'dro, I'm pourin' lean, ohh
I'm poppin' tags, he poppin' tags
Diamonds dancin' on my faces, in my bezels face
Presidential status
Doin' a donut out of Magic, 360 man
Doin' donuts at 200, ooooh
I'm smokin' 'dro, I'm pourin' lean, ohh
Future ride Bentley coupe
Young Scooter ride Bentley coupe
We do the shit that bosses do
Real street shit
Scooter always flexin'
And I pull up and embarrass you
Hit up Eliantte
Yeah, that's a ice check
We don't rock fake gold
Real diamonds 'round my neck
BM
FBG
we blood brothers
500 in my blunt, that's how I roll up
Doin' dash at 200, ooh
I'm smokin' 'dro, I'm pourin' lean, ohh
