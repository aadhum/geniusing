I take that loud pack and then I stuff it in the dutch
I'm on that Charlie Sheen, I got to win, I got to win
I'm ballin' like Kareem, I'm livin' in this life of sin
I had to make a change, itâ€™s fuck Obama I'm the truth
I push one button, the roof gon' go into the trunk
I'm John Gotti paid, now I'm going Donald Trump
I got this one bitch, I'll put her in the red bottoms
Tell me the combination, I'm 'bout to fill it up with racks
I'm flying up the Doja, 9-1-1, them the horses is inside the motor
Everything Versace, Medusa including my locs
