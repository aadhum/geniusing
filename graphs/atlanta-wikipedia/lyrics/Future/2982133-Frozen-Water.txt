I got chains and they flooded like New Orleans, yeah yeah
You niggas a mess, I swear you best show some respect
Or else I guarantee you'll get wet
You fuckin' with us, I suggest you invest in a vest
A choppa no less than a tech
You niggas want trouble in that I'm the best
They just wanna talk, I ain't finna do that
I just might pull up wherever you at
Put my foot in your ass and a hole in your hat
