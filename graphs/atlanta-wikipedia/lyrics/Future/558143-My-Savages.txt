I be on the phone with Doe Boy
I be telling him, he inspired me to go harder
Know what I'm saying, real talk
My savages, my savages, my savages
I’m always dressing fresher than a mannequin
I grew up in a ruthless ass environment
I’m on the phone with yo, I ask him how the trial went
Roll some herb up, pour some syrup up
I got love but it ain’t like the love I got for India
She held me down when I was broke, I got her to infinity
And I just bought a pound of kush so I can smoke that shit
The fame is doing a lot of damage to my friendships
If Esco didn’t love me would’ve been done jumped ship
Say I’m Illuminati, they tryna make me catch a body
I don’t know when I'ma flip, nigga
Get me some codeine and sip, nigga
Before this shit pour up a fo', ain't falling in love with no ho
That what you want for me? That what you really expect?
You thinking I’m sitting up depressed?
I'm somewhere countin' up me a check
Because the Spurs weren't tinted, I told em ain't got nothing to hide
We gone leave a nigga stiffer than a mannequin
