Its only the chosen ones(Its only the chosen ones,Its only the chosen ones)
That come from nothing and make millions(jaiha)
And continue doing it
You ain't even tryna be special(tryna be special, tryna be special)
You ain't even tryna be special( tryna be special,tryna be special)
You ain't even tryna be special(tryna be special,tryna be special)
I thought you was someone special
You know the dues I paid but the money drive 'em insane
You got a Grammy and young nigga on that purple drank
I'm a motherfucking astronaut
I made a million off of metro ask the dope game
rock the show up like some cocaine
Burkin bag on bad bitches
I'm rare nigga
I been there nigga starving
My confidence been there nigga
I got all the scars to prove it
I took my scars and made a movie
I got all my niggas with me through the bad and the good
I got all my jewels on me and I'm still in the hood
Codeine calm my nerves I was getting high since a kid
I took all my problems and I turned it all into hits
Freeband gang for life thats the blueprint
Juug!
Juug!
Juug!
