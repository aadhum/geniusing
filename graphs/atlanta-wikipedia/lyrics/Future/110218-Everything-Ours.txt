That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours
I’m leanin’ like I’m on a fifth of Henny
I’m in the space, cause you know sky’s not my limit
My girl she wakin’ up and she ain’t shop at Lennox
I’m in that Lamborghini, no it’s not no rented
You see this ice on me and all my windows tinted
She want that Rover, I’ma go and put her in it
I'm like Dozier, I’ma gone and jump on in it
She told her friends and braggin’ on the way I'm hittin' it
That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours
Threw a 60 on my wrist, 120 round my neck
20 thousand dollar flights, Freebandz ridin’ jets
That money bring you power
Good bales and all that powder
We chokin’ off that sour
And all this money ours
That money bring you power
Them bales and that powder
We chokin' on that sour
And all these bitches ours
