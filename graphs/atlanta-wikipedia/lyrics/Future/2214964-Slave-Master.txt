Jump out a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour up two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Jump out a new whip, nigga, I got my a slave master
I pour up two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Watch us drift off this good dodie
Puttin' it in twelve o'clock, smash up the script
She came unfaithful off pill for real
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Stayin' true to this culture
Don't get caught tryna be a vulture
Put a pinky ring on my pinky finger
Got some VVS's on my middle finger
Fuck you pussy niggas, all you niggas get the middle finger
I'm just keepin' it triller, G
Jump out a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Jump out a new whip, nigga, like a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
bale
Got a fish spot with that Molly in it
I stack up some chickens and get it
I see how they watch and they imitate me
This gold AP got 'em fascinated
Call her right now if you need me
Put some Aquafina on another ring
I disguise pain when I make it rain
Jump out a new whip, nigga, like I'm a slave master
I pour two zips nigga I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
I'm feelin' way better, I'm feelin' way better
Brooklyn ridin' with us, got my jeweler ridin' with me
Do it for Double he gone, do it for Double he gone
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now
Long live A$AP Yams, long live A$AP Yams
Long live A$AP Yams, I'm on that codeine right now
