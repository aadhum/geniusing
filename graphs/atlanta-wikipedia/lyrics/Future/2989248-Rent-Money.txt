I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Treat me like I'm Al Capone, nigga, fuck you
John Gotti, Illuminati, nigga, fuck you
Red bottoms with the fur like Frank Luc
I bought some VVS and she caught the chain flu
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Yah, I was sippin' my codeine from the beginnin'
We light Liv up on a Sunday, come see us livin'
I was petrified, you know my right wrist authentic
I get glorified, that Richard Mille cost 250
On my Usain Bolt shit, I ran up in yo' set
Fuckin' with them strippers all in G5ive
And as soon as the club closed we board the G5
I got five percent tint on each side
I'm on my Nicky Barnes shit, so it's fuck school
I'm blowin' money real fast like Big Meech crew
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
Them bricks coming in like the John Doe crew
I fuck dem Super Bowl bitches down in Houston
I built my empire up like Lucious
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
I make the blogs with ya bitch 'cause I'm ruthless
Yah, I get cash money like I'm Mack Maine
I be smokin' rapper weed with my gang
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
Got the MAC-11 cocked, it got the kick too
Servin' niggas like Doughbeezy in my house shoes
I just fucked a rapper bitch, I should diss you
I fucked this R&B bitch, I should thank you
