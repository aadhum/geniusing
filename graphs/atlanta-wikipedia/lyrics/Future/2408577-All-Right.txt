All right, all right
Love, love, love, all right
You know I be gettin' that moolah on a daily basis, all right
You said you always be there for me baby, you said "all right"
I know my niggas gon' be there for me always, all right
Hit the club, pop a few bottles, and fuck a few models, all right
We been on molly, yeah, we been on Xans
Hermes, Celines, and Chanels, you gon' tote 'em
I spend stacks on my rings, I spend stacks on my Rollies
Smokin' this dodie, I'm downin' this Codeine
Diamonds shinin' to infinity
I got 10 rings like it's 10 of me
I got money, fame, I got enemies
I can feel the pain of my enemy
I been downin' Percocets with Hennessy
Gave her two Xans now she proud of me
Gave her two Xans now she proud of me
You know I be gettin' that moolah on a daily basis, all right
Hit the club, pop a few bottles, and fuck a few models, all right
We been on molly, yeah, we been on Xans
