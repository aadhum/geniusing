Streetz Calling!
I walk on Jimmy, got the smoke on loud
I got perfect attendance, bring that work to yo town
Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss
I made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
I paid my grandma rent, and got my lil sister a house
I keep a pocket full of money any time I'm stepping out
Cause I my made myself a boss, I made myself a boss

Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss

Cause I made myself a boss I made myself I made myself a boss

I keep a pocket full of money any time I'm stepping out
Cause I my made myself a boss, I made myself a boss
