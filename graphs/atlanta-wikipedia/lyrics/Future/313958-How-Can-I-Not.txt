We on that drank we on that drank
I got 20,000 on me by mistake
How can I not ball until everything fade away
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
Run in your spot, smashing your ho, fuck on your couch
fuck all your thoughts
I appreciate you niggas I appreciate you bitches for keeping me relevant talk all you want
How can you not get hooked on percocet
Me and money got a chemistry, me and you a big difference
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not? How can I not? How can I not?
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
Gotta call this plug, count this check, how can I not
Gotta work them spots, work them Glocks, watch that clock
Gotta move these bricks, I'm on probation bitch I'm hot
How can I not get all this money give all my niggas in the hood a block
Buy a drop and another watch then flex some more nigga how can I not
Them freeband niggas got all that money but BMG how we stamp them blocks
Niggas swagger jacking off of Future trying to steal his spot
How can I not get the Xans and the mollies the percs and the drank and the drank in the Syrup
How can I not take my style back from niggas
When niggas was taking my style way before
How can I not get this guala and flip all this guala
Because a young nigga was starving
