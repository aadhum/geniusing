Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera
I'm fly like plane, and I ain't gon' never land
With a penthouse, but guess where I been staying
In a Continental, with this fat ass Dominican
I'm an astronaut, yes, yes, yes I am
I'ma take this guap and cash out on a lamb
Throw some red bottoms,
Jimmy Choos be all you wearing
Fuck the dress code, nigga it ain't no comparing
Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera
Emilio
Valentino Gucci
From another planet, yes, yes, yes I am
Got the Gucci boots on like it's snowing, straight up
I put red on the bottom of ya shoes, straight up
Molly with the lean feel like you come from another planet, straight up
Every car I drive you know it gotta be Panamera
