Ostentação, palavra que eu gosto de ouvir
Pacific Ocean out the backyard lookin' sexy
I'ma need fresh air
I'ma need fresh air
I need to get out on my own
It's been too long
Feelin' like Janet Jackson said, it's all for you
I'll be right back, I'm on auto-pilot for the week
touch your toes while you cookin' breakfast
Tell me, why wait?
If I need to breathe
Tell me why suffocate
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
If I need to breathe
Breathe, breathe
We, we, we, we
