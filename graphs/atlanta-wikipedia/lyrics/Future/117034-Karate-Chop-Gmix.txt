[Intro]
You know, This just some real nigga shit, a real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

[Hook]
Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in the new 'rarri
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean
You wouldn't touch a key, if your first name was Mozart
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Future]
Whipping up a cake, just to go and snatch a spider
Young nigga play with keys, like a type writer
Al Capone, John Gotti was a nigga idol
I was never snitching, I can put it on the Bible
In a 4 door beamer, driving with a rifle
Nigga where you at, nigga we go pull up on ya
Young Bitch looking like Janet in the 80's
We was grinding up from a tube and a baby
Got the girl dripping wet like a jerry curl
Got a styrofoam cup and its full of syrup
Send it over from New Mexico & Let me Work
I can get 36 for a clean shirt

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Pop a lot of pain pills
'Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheels
Yeah, beat that pussy up like Emmett Till
Yeah
2 cellphones ringing at the same time
That's your ho, call her from 2 different phones
Tell that bitch we need to fuck alone
See you fuck her wrong, & I fuck her long
I got a love/hate relationship with Molly
I rather pop a ollie, & my dick is a Trolley
Boy I bury you like Halle, & these hoes say I'm blind
Cause I don't see nothing wrong with a little bump & grind
& I just received a package, them other niggas taxing
Man my pockets so fat, I'm starting to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for some chickens
& he already home man that nigga must be snitching
Cut him off like Karate

[Hook]
