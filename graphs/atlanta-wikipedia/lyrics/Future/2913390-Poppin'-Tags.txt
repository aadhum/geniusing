Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Hermès, oh, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
I got American muscle, I'm gonna hit me a lick
Sippin' on 'Tussin, fuckin' and hustlin'
Dope boys shoppin' at Walters, I bought the whole store
Fuck boy doin' that talkin', that's my old hoe
Stars inside the ceiling, I'm on go go
You don't want no war, nigga, oh no, oh no
Codeine floodin' Atlanta, bitch ass niggas with hammers
Bitch ass niggas in Pampers, fuck around murk his mamma
My young niggas so playa, fuck around kill you in sandals
nana
King Jaffe Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
I came here to purchase, I ain't worried 'bout a ticket
Bitch you want that G-Wagon?, go muthafuckin' get it
I had on my ski mask in the muthafuckin' trenches
Homie Blood talkin', is you muthafuckin' Crippin'?
I get the plug talkin' 'bout these muthafuckin' chickens
Put up some lean before they can lean
I'm runnin' right through a machine
Cuban hangin' on my neck, whip on cruise
I just copped the Coupe, 63's with the Forgi's
Bought a couple 'Raris and I bought a couple Porsches
Zone Six fuck shit, finessin' and extortin'
King Joffy Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God
I been poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Poppin' tags, I been poppin' tags
Goyard, oh, pick out what you want
Hermès on, pick out what you want
New Chanel, oh, pick out what you want
Fuck your baby daddy, smash you on the Xanny
We just got the pack in from Mexico, vroom
Soon as it touch down I'm goin' ape
Put it on the hood like you claim Grape
Pull up in the hood in a new Wraith
King Joffy Jo, my body wrapped in gold
Money stackin' tall, now I think I'm seein' God
