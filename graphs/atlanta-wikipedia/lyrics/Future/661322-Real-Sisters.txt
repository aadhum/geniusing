This that new wave
Future Hendrix
Say you getting throwed, I'm tryna pour up with you
Oh, that's your best friend? I'm tryna fuck her with you
First met the bitch, they said they real sisters
I don't give a fuck if they were real sisters
Serving packs of chickens in a Dodge Hemi
Fuck around with me, I fuck twin sisters
Whipping up a key, tryna dodge prison
Trapping in the street, in some Margiela's
Paying attorney fees with that Godzilla
Sell that heroin in the trap, I'm a dog, nigga
Black Migo Gang, got them bales on us
Way before the fame, I had a bale on me
20,000 off a juug, ain't got a scale on me
Real shooters, they'll sit in jail for me
I'm in Lil' Mexico, we 'bout to take something
Say you getting throwed, I'm tryna pour up with you
Oh, that's your best friend? I'm tryna fuck her with you
First met the bitch, they said they real sisters
I don't give a fuck if they were real sisters
Serving packs of chickens in a Dodge Hemi
Fuck around with me, I fuck twin sisters
Hublot on a nigga, so she down for me
I done fell in love with the Lambo
I been taking Molly, rockin' Tommy
Tom Ford, nigga, walking like a zombie
Standing in the trenches screaming, "murder!"
Say you getting throwed, I'm tryna pour up with you
Oh, that's your best friend? I'm tryna fuck her with you
First met the bitch, they said they real sisters
I don't give a fuck if they were real sisters
Serving packs of chickens in a Dodge Hemi
Fuck around with me, I fuck twin sisters
