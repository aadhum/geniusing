This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie
I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil shawty be popping them Xans off
Lil mama, she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
I got way too much juice, niggas can't hold me
Bitches can't hold me, I'm juiced up with shorty
I'm whipping the 'Rari, or the new Maserati
Bust a jug in the West End at the parking lot
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot
My partners on dust, they gon' shoot up a whole stadium
I call the play like I'm John Madden
I fuck that bitch in the Steve Maddens
Pitchin' the ROC like I'm Ty-Ty
Mixin' the soda like hair dye
Twist up some dodie, my nigga, let's twist up some dodie
This for my young niggas grindin', went stashed 'em a Rollie
They treat you like Lord, they treat you like God when you beat the odds
Used to sell my crack at Days Inn, had it crazy hot
I went to work, they were layin' off
Lil shawty be popping them Xans off
Lil mama, she do it the best now
Sucking that dick with no hands now
