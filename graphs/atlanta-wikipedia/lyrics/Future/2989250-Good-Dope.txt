You know it’s Pluto

My niggas in jail be stabbin
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Got some junkies at the door, got them junkies at the door

Styro-foam cup, purple Act' gluey

Five percent on the wagon
My niggas in the streets be shootin’
My niggas in jail be stabbin
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Purple Act' gluey, sticky, icky
Esco he a hippie, tricky, tricky
I do good dope, I got a good hoe
Junkies at the door, got dem junkies at the door
Tiffany's, Tiffany's, we goin’ shoppin' at Tiffany's
Five percent on the wagon
My niggas in the streets be shootin’
My niggas in jail be stabbin
