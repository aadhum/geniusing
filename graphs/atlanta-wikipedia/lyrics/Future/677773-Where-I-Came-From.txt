23 bricks in a speaker, Man
Now we drinkin' that red now
I been gettin' at it since Juvenile
I used to trap out my Grandma's house
I got them pills make your brother kill
I serve my Auntie that water
Shit, I serve my Momma some water
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
Cutlass and Regal, the Carlo
And 'rari, that Benz, diablo !
I pull up in a Diablo
Money that mucho de nacho
Hundred round drum, I'm Bin Laden
23 bricks in a speaker, Man
