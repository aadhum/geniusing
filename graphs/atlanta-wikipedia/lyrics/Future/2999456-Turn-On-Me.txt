I seen a so-called good girl turn on me
I passed it off like a blunt to the homies
I passed it off like a blunt to the homies
Morris Brown,
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
After I give you this game, you should never let a lame hit it
I'm the one took all the blame for it
I had to look at this lame happy
Try to figure out then why I ain't happy
Nowadays, I deal with lawsuits
You tellin' me that's what it came to
After I hit it and splashed in it
You should never ever ever let a square get it
I had you, tatted my name on you
