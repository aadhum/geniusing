This for my niggas out there fuckin' up them sacks and gettin' em right back you hear me. (I see you fool)
Spend this lil money like it ain't nun
Ima ball forever
Money to the ceiling
Ice in the Mediterranean Sea yeaaaah
Racks taller than the building
Spend them lil bands like they free
Ima ball forever
Ima ball forever
Worth a couple million on the low
This a public info you need to know
Ima ball forever
Michael Kohrs gold piece naw this ain't no Timex
Throw it up in ONYX get right back out the pyrex
Got the waitress at the pink pony ridin with the luggage
I can make 20 bands off it and ion have to touch it
On my way to 5th plaza hit Gucci in a rush
I got NBA money, never be broke again
My T-shirt Marc Jacob they imitate
So I freeband all my apparel I see ya later (freeband!)
