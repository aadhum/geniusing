We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna neva
Cause we became the best of friends
You got all the questions and I know all the answers
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
We don’t wanna neva end
We don’t wanna
I could tell you was into me from our instant chemistry
I'll go to war over you want, I dont give a fuck by showing you
You know what it is shawty, forever my lil shawty
Long as I’m swimmin’ in Benjamins,
you shop with no limited
I took a sip of your tea and I ain’t been right ever since
As I think to myself what’d it be is it heaven sent
Let’s put the past behind us
And go far away where nobody can find us
You could leave today I bet you’ll come back tomorrow
I could see the hate is comin’ from a mile up
And it’s only preparin’ us for what we got comin’
Is there anything you wanna know?
Is there any place you rather be?
