Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Rich nigga since birth, Louis V chinchilla
Bought a brand new Rover, drive it like a 4 wheeler
Solid gold: AP, flooded out with them crystals
Shinning just like molly, I woke up in a new bugatti
Free lil Kirk Wood, Young Gotti, free my nigga White Boy too
You got goons around you nigga, I keep shooters around me fool
Im a young rich nigga from the bottom I came up and I can’t lose
Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
Bought a Phantom cause I always wanted one
All my niggas millionaires it ain’t just one
Have a few chains on, I don’t have but one
