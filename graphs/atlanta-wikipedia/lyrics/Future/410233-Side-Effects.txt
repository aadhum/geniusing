You pay my ticket, hold down my crib
You wash my clothes, you buy my groceries
You stay up late, you say whatever, that's whatever it take
You a fucking superstar, it ain't hard to tell
Answer the door, it's FEDEX. Never read my mail
Cause I never take nothing from you, you deserve it all
Just tell me what it costs, ball 'till we fall
I give it all to you
No side effects, No side effects, No side effects
My name stay tatted, across your heart
I smoke too much, say you don't mind
