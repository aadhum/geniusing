I'm stainless
Tethered by earth and flame
Ingrained with higher purpose know the worth of my name
The sacks that I sold
Kept my baby out the cold and her belly full of food
And her back never lacking of clothes
This game is so grimy it's impossible to win with your innocence intact
Matter of fact it deranges
The person that you wanted to remain intrinsically changes
We can actualize but our actual lives are affected by a hunger for sane-ness
Become that man that'd rather die standing than ever live head down bending a knee
So I purify my soul in the land of the fire
