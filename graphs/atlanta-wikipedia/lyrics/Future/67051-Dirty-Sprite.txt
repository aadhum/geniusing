I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"
One, Two cups keep my ice cool
Purple Sprite on top of ice
I'm rocking ice on dirty sprite
I'm space cadet
I spit a Check
Hold my bitch, my bitch say 'why I'm on purple shit'
My purple stuff stay in my cup
Got drank on me I pour me up
Texas oil got me spoiled
Red and Yellow I'm leaning hard
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"
I wake up leaning from last night
I drink my lean for breakfast
RIP to Chad Butler
I got my favorite drink with me it taste just like some kool-aid
Well listen cold with screw up kit we be leaning always
They shook up with dirty sprite
Promethazine can't get enough
Till I O.D you know whats up
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"
I'm moving slow the lights ain't bright as they supposed to be
My eyes heavy see what happens when you fuck with me
I think I lost my heart beat for a second and a half
I'm on that Pimp C
I'm on that DJ Screw
I'm on that Big Hawk
I don't know what to do
Pour up a 3 or 4
My sprite so dirty fool
My bitch remind me all the time 'that drink will kill you"
