Cool in every club like a milli, oh
It's the kid, kid
Pretty, round, brown
Ohh, you make me want to run this damn mining of
Going to the brand new diamond cuts
Got to find the prettiest girl in the world
Make me want to conquer the whole damn world
Shawty got a face like, " Who that girl "
I don't care what it takes to do that girl
You can think anything if you that girl
Picture white
Looking so bright
Drive her through the hood, show her off to my friends
Take her to the club, show her ass off again
Baby, want to say the the way I feel
Spending a lot of dough, cause that's the way I deal
Billion dollar kid ain't shit without you
Make a nigga look rich, standing beside you
How could I hide you
