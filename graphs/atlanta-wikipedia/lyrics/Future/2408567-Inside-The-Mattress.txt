I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Yeah, Hendrix
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Hit an island like Gilligan
Not just a regular civilian
I rap for the squad, I'm a champion
Remember we hit up the highway, we got us a stash spot
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
I get on the stage and I rap 'til I pass out
Hit another city and another city, I'm just groovin'
Gotta keep my pride, I'm a general
Got a hundred hoes, got a hundred Xans
We gon' party hard till the moon calls
She done fell in love with the mushrooms
Put some cough syrup in a Mountain Dew
Cartier on a bad bitch
Caught a year on a bad bitch
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
I'm workin' everyday, craftin'
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Hit an island like Gilligan
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
I never told the world about you
I never told the homies 'bout you, not once
I never had no bitter towards you
I never had no drama for you, not once
I never want to go to none of these award shows
That's not me
Only the time will tell the day I prevail and get me a Grammy
Lil Mexico, kept it real from the start
If I did it for you it came from the heart
I wake up and cook up a kilo
Take a flight on a jet out to Rio
Got lawyers and actresses and models pursuin' me now
Our foundation built on loyalty, you can't ruin me now
Stacks hid inside the mattress
Racks hid inside the mattress
Packs hid inside the mattress
Ganks hid inside the mattress
Vert' dippin' through traffic
I'm cool on her, I done had her
Hit an island like Gilligan
Remember as soon as we touch down, nigga cash out
Goodbye
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
I pour out yellow tuss, I pour out yellow tuss
Cause I gotta have it
