Oh yeah, Super Super
Astronaut, yeah
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
10 black whips, I'm too consistent
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym
I’m 'bout to fuck up some mula
I don’t care if you was my daddy
Bitch I'ma cut off your neck
We rockin' VV's and SS's
I swear they get a lil’ crowded
My chains; they fight for attention
My neck'll get a lil’ rowdy
I keep me a bag of those Skittles
Tryna get you a radical feelin'
Automatic, it came with no ceiling
I was sittin' in the back of the MARTA
Now I sit in the back of a foreign
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
We 'bout to roll up some Franklins
We 'bout to roll up some loud
I'm swervin' all over the map
I got a Panamanian
I let her go to Sak's Fifth Avenue
Run up some laps
I spent an M on indo
Put it on an 18-wheeler (scrilla)
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to cop me a Mazzi
I'm ‘bout to cop me a Jag
I done made 21 million
I got Ezekiel stacks
I done made 21 million
I had to run up a sack
Just know that Pluto is hungry
Like when I worked the midget
Everywhere I go is Fiji
Giorgio Armani, I'm drippin' in it
Aston Martin, I'm whippin' in it
I'm 'bout to push me a Wraith, you won't catch me in the gym
I'm 'bout to push me some weight, you won't catch me in the gym
