Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Uhhh, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Drinking lean smoking kush, taking molly’s on, molly’s on
Yeah, R.I.P that Amy Winehouse
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Yeah I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab, I need to go to rehab
Codeine in my system, movin' slower than a Screw tape
And I took a Vicodin like I got a tooth ache
Purple in the Sprite, I mix it up, I’m like a scientist
Smoking on that California, first thing when I awake
Drinking Easter Pink
Mix the purple with the Sprite – it turn pink
