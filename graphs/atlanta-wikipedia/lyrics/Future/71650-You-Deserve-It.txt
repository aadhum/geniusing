You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it
You deserve it, Future
You deserve it
Just the other day, my lil’ cousin call me from school and said
I was in the dungeon
Catch the juugins, I paid attention
Know how I'm living, my slang tremendous
I’m better than you and I know it
I will show it
You ain’t flowing how I’m flowin’
That’s why I’m goin’
Places you ain’t goin’
I'mma keep goin'
And goin' until I’m growin’
To a mogul, come up with explosive
I pick that up from rico
My cousin had my back from day one, mano y mano
I believe in keepin’ it one thousand and stayin’ humble
You’re right, I told to take the route through the jungle
Keep the same integrity when I was standing on the corner
I go so fucking hard, till my heart skip a beat
I always been expensive, ain’t nothing about me cheap
I'm the realest nigga you ever seen
Since Michael Jackson – Billie Jean
All this pain can't even rappin’
Sometimes I feel like I wanna sing
It goes without me saying
It brings water to my eyes just to hear me on the radio
I worked for this (I worked for this)
