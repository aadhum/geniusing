If you ain't pourin' up Activis, up then I don't wanna drink
(?), I
I'm higher than a plane, this shit ain't 'bout to change
Chickens in the bumper, that's a chicken coupe
Lil Mexico nigga
I'm a Freebandz nigga trust that
I'm drinkin' on that lean by the gallon
From the gutter to the mansion
We play by the same rules
Don't nothin' change but ya address
