Fucking cockroaches
Muthafuckin’ Freebandz
Want me to be the bad guy?
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
ends
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I take over the streets, fresh off the banana boat
I come straight from the east, where niggas split your cantaloupe
You tell me where you wanna meet, I’m coming with a gang of dope
My cigar full of loud,
A Porsche Carrera, Panamera, 911
I do the whole dash, dropping all cash
Plugged in with Colombians, I know Sosa
All I got is my balls and my word,
The money got me geeked like I took a hit of coca
My life is a movie,
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
On the hood you see the Stallion,
passenger a stallion
Niggas getting nervous, I’m passing out the Valium
I suggest you pop it,
but please don’t get too sleepy
Used to have them bitches twerking
400 West Peachtree
Bet you those same hoes’ll see me, be like that's how you feeling
Used to stay up at The Twelve,
now your worth like 12 million
Boy you did, boy you did it, you did the unexpected
I say fuck the unexpected, I just did what I projected
I swear young women are lost these days while older women dig me
Fucking women that knew Biggie so it really ain't no biggie
It’s just OVO and XO,
and freebandz the committee
And shout out to Toronto, bitch, I’m Tony in my city
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
ears
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
I’m about to cop the Porsche
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
You leave me no choice, take em to
Tony Montana, Tony Montana, Tony Montana
Another shot of Quelo, she'll be coming back to pesos
I come with the yayo
I move like a mob boss,
it’s gonna take an army
The world is mine,
nigga, you get it if you want it
You fuckin with me, you’ll move to Alaska by the morning
You want me to be the bad guy?
Okay, it's on then
Champagne spilling, crab cakes everywhere
My white bitch trippin', she say I ain't playing fair
I’m about to cop a tiger, and put it in the car seat
Freebandz a company,
