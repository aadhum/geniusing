Metro Boomin want some more nigga
All my niggas some junkies, they keep that bread on 'em dawg
Yo lil ho is a monkey, she got a head on her, dawg
Caught a flight outta London, I can't see nothin' but stars
It don't fuck with my conscience I serve my auntie that raw
Fell asleep at the gamblin' house with that heater right on me
And I got me some stripes like I keep Adidas on me
And I don't believe hype, all my soda get spiked
I shake the Codeine and Sprite cause that's just the way of life
And I say fuck all the rules, I'd rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools cause I'm ready for that drama
I'm young Freddy Kruger,
These hoes'll smash up on your niggas and be very proud
I don't be trustin' these hoes, I just be smashin' these hoes
I'm gone pull up on these hoes
Young nigga trappin out the ghost
Choppin' like Kung Fu
Used to wanna fuck 2 now I wanna fuck the crew
Me and young Metro trappin out lear
Chasin' that cheese, you ain't nothin' but a rat
And I say fuck all the rules, I'd rather fuck your baby momma
And I say bring all your tools cause I'm ready for that drama
