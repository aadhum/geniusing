You a astronaut chick and that’s the only thing that matter to me, you was made for me
On a whole ‘nother level
me and you we light the room up, only together
And we don’t wanna go to sleep, cause we too obsessed
With the high life, and we gon' blast up like a rocket when the time right
You don’t drop off your pedestal, well you shine like a bezel, boo
Saks Fifth Avenue,
we're hotter like May and June
More love than February
Without a doubt in my mind, I'm takin' off and you comin’
Shawty she go both ways, anytime she go smash models
Got them VVS diamonds they don't bling, them bitches blang
She the red on the bottom of her shoes (on her shoes)
