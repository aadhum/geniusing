I ain't about to play with these niggas feel me?
I'm 'bout to get these bags ya dig?
Future, hold up, wassup
Freebandz, Freebandz
Showing improvement
Getting fetti ya dig?
Riding low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Burn it down nigga while I wait
Burn it down on good drink
On good drink, on good drink
Get these yellow diamonds like a honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Getting doped up that's everyday
Hermes on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day
Fuck a bitch in a big way
And I hit her right on the staircase
Hit that mouth I go bareface
When I'm in that mouth I go bareface
Pain pills took a double dose
Gotta bank roll with some iron on me
They told you I was real, real nigga
They wasn't lying on me
I get better and better with time don't I?
Drinking codeine like wine don't I?
Step on the scene, got diamonds on me
It's a dirty game, niggas dying in it
The black Range got her riding it
Hit her throat then dive in it
Flip her over, switch sides in it
Steal a car use for Friday night
To hotbox at the ride in
Jimmy Choo I just vibe in 'em
I don't dab in 'em I just vibe in 'em
Never tryna be a crab nigga
You can hit him with that yopper now
Laying low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Get these yellow diamonds like honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Hermes on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day
Styrofoams in the Phantom on me
Few racks with a hammer on me
Gotta move around cause them cameras on me
Gotta keep it cool when them cameras on me
High-tech and I'm still pouring
Got high-tech and I'm still pouring
Taliban game AK
big rings like MJ
Audemar with a big face
Laying low in a Maybach
Spraying at you like an Arab
Streets having you going crazy
I got my young niggas going crazy
Masked up nigga everyday
Got the sharp stick with me everyday
Half a pound in the ash tray
Get these yellow diamonds like honeycomb
Riding low like an esé
Hermes on me every day
Keep some Cartier on me every day
