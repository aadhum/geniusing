Yeah, I guess I feel like Lance Armstrong
We gotta win the race, hell yeah
We call it the Tour of the Streets
I took those VVS's - and slapped ‘em right on my chest
I took off in a Bentley, and came back in a Spider
My trap on steroids, we servin' Mark McGwire
I think I'm Big Meech – all my niggas sell drugs
My shit's on Mobb Deep - like I'm from NYC
A thousand for some glasses - I see my city in 3D
I'm poppin' bottles, nigga - like it’s the 4th of July
I think I’m Bill Gates - I'm takin' over the Net
We shootin' choppers, nigga - we ain't fuck with them tecs
I think I'm Young Jeezy - cause I motivate thugs, yeahhhh
I think I'm Lil’ Boosie - I’m ‘bout to start sendin' hits
And Future Castellano - I’m on that mafia shit
I took those VVS's - and slapped 'em right on my chest
I took off in a Bentley - and came back in a Spider
My trap on steroids - we servin' Mark McGwire
I know my dope raw - I seen it come out her ass
I wipe that shit off – and throw it right in the bag
I think I'm Antawn Jamison – I'm ballin', ballin', ballin'
I took those VVS's - and slapped 'em right on my chest
I took off in a Bentley - and came back in a Spider
My trap on steroids - we servin' Mark McGwire
