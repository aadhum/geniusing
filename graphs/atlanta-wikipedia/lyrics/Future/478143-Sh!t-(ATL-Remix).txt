[Intro: Future]
Oh, you know you ain't got all them guns
And you ain't killed nobody yet
How many times you shot that muhfucka?
Ain't nobody popped up dead
Shit!
[Hook: Future]
Talkin' bout ya poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' bout 100 bottles, nigga, you ain't pop shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spendin' money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Shit, shit
Pastor Disaster, get off my dick
I be clean from my cup to my kicks
Winter olympic games and the categories caine
Bet ya one fuckin' thing, I'll win a gold medal
Why ya actin' like a bitch? Lil Jon, my nigga
