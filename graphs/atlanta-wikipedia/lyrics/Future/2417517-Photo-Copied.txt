Yeah, I'm on savage time nigga
I'm on savage time
I'm on ratchet time
I'm gon' smash her but she photocopied
We don't wanna cuddle with none of you bitches
Uh, I'm cool on them, don't even dap them niggas
Uh, I was in the trap they tried to trap a nigga
I pull up in that new Maybach and they wave
These niggas won't show no deuces they got hoe ways
I walk inside the club and they wave
I got bloods, crips, and GDs in my family tree
And where ever I go them vice lords with me
Bobble head bitches, they get smashed automatic
You niggas don't exist we eat filet mignon
Go brazy with your bitch she try to stay the night
The first thing in the AM send her on a flight
I'm gon' smash her but she photocopied
I'm seeing the way she actin' on the 'Gram
You misrepresenting who I am
I know you ain't saving that pussy
You know somebody play in that pussy
And where ever I go them vice lords with me
Bobble head bitches, they get smashed automatic
Go brazy with your bitch she try to stay the night
The first thing in the AM send her on a flight
I'm gon' smash her but she photocopied
