I got them diamonds like Africa
I  got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I'm gone off Ferrari and I'm huggin' that carbon
I never say sorry
Put some dope in the cup
Go and order the truck cause the Bentley is comin'
The end of my sleeve is on plain jane
Sippin' Codeine on the plane man
Switchin' Moschino my name brand
Switchin' Moschino my name brand
Kilo for kilo, Young Future Pacino
These bitches, they treat me like Michael and Tito
When that dope ain't got cut on it, call it Gambino
I know a peon got more chains than Deion
I'm the one who put all them birds in the Neon
I got a stallion, pull up like it's polo
You bozo, you bozo, you nigga that no no
It's the good, the bad, and ugly
I got them diamonds like Africa
I  got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
My styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy, my styrofoam muddy
And I know how to work it
And I know I ain't perfect
And I know I ain't perfect
Buy whatever I purchase
If you on that loud I can smell it, it's octane
It's the good, the bad, and ugly
I got them diamonds like Africa
I  got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
I got the blow on a one-footed trafficker
I got them diamonds like Africa
