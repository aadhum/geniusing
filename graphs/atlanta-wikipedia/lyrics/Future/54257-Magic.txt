[Hook]
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
Call up my accountant, he gon' make it do magic
Had to get a driver just to drop me at the airport
Way I smoked the blunts man I burned 'em up like Newport
All this damn cash make a bitch wanna retire
Gotta drop a half a brick if you wanna put me on a flyer
See these diamonds ain't none of 'em fugazi
Two bad bitches wanna fuck me to Grady's
A young G in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot I'mma do a 180
Drinking on a Sprite got lean all in it
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
The way I made the work disappear, call it magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow drinking magic
Voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic, voilà magic
Billionaire boy that's true inspiration
Learned the Astronaut Kid, no such thing as limitation
Flying down 20 in the motherfucking spaceship
Two bitches trailing in a Beemer out of Germany
Gotta thing for me, they wanna sing for me
They like my energy, I'm an embassy
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I don't trick but I could make you famous
You could disappear from your past life
My bitches on they high horse
