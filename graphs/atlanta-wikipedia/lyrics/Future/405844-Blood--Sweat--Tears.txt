I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone here could see it
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I wish everyone, I wish everyone
I gave my blood, sweat, tears
You couldn't have known what I did for this
(You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known)
(You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known)
You couldn't have known what I did for this
(You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known)
(You couldn't have known, you couldn't have known)
Ay, This right here, this is a miracle
This moment now, this is spiritual
Stay with the fork and the powder to cook
Cause we whip and we add on additionals
Ain't no real nigga gon' eat with you
Everybody want a dollar, everybody want a check
Nigga there's only one future messiah, now higher than what you respect
How the fuck you get my number? Hungry ass baby, karma
You ain't never knew my struggle, they will never ever understand my hunger
I wish everyone in here could see it
(I wish everyone in here could see it)
Ya'll niggas never believed me
(Ya'll niggas never believe it)
Nigga we fresh off the boat, we don't give a fuck about sleeping on floors
Nigga I'm fresh out of court, I just fired my lawyer, then bought a new lawyer
I know you went thinkin' I left you behind
You know what I came through to be here
I came, I struggled, I made it, I conquered
One hunnid, I kept my word, I kept my word, I promise (I promise)
We redefined gravity, go way beyond Earth
