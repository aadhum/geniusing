Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
I had to smash lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil shawty on probation
Paranoid, pull in the garage, one in the head
I'm on hydroponic nigga, full of bars and that red
I'm in camouflage and I fell in love with this bread
I don't ordinary no type of nigga, I don't beg
I bet I keep that tool on me everywhere
Spent a couple mill on my bitch last year
I just put a new whip on the E-way
I just pop the tag on the Benz, it was Monday
I be on them Xans and that Molly, I ain't frontin'
I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil shawty on probation
I go Corleone 'bout the check
Alexander McQueen
Bitch, I'm getting the same money as Cam Newton
Ask me how it feel to be a millionare
I had to spank lil' shawty with my jeans on
And I had my pistol in my pocket
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
Can't trust none of these bitches, gotta be cautious
I bought all the sodas at the gas station
I just put a famous bitch on rotation
I just put that famous bitch on rotation
I just put lil shawty on probation
