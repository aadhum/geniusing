[Pre-Hook]
This a picture, what a picture
I'm fuckin' with you, tell that nigga he ain't with you
I'm so horny, I'm so horny
Whatever I gotta do to tell you good mornin'

[Hook]
Good mornin'
Somehow I'm feelin' so close to you baby
I'm fuckin' with you, baby, good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin', mornin'
Every time I see her I swear we get deeper and deeper
Good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin'
She do me plenty favors, you always on your worst behavior
Give her diamonds and pearls, I know her sex as good as her curse
Girl I rarely brag on love, I rarely ever get hurt
You all under my arm while I'm all under your skirt
Girl your angel wings so controllable
Girl your essence is so damn adorable
You always wake first, give what you give

Good mornin'
Somehow I'm feelin' so close to you baby
I'm fuckin' with you, baby, good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin', mornin'
Every time I see her I swear we get deeper and deeper
Good mornin'
We be all night
Baby, good mornin'
We made it and we happy and they mad at us
Good mornin', girl you're off the market
We done painted a portrait, we lookin' back at our fortune
