You ain't talking money, don't talk to us
Ball harder than you when I'm locked up
You the type of nigga that pop up
When niggas rolling that kush, huh?
Got mine growing like grapevines
In the backyard, come look, bruh
I pull up, hop out
Bad hoes just pop out
Hating niggas better watch out
Still riding with that Glock out
Spend a couple of mill, no stress at all
You small ball like golf balls
I'm basketball, go ask your broad
Tell her legs open sesame
Abracadabra, she wet for me
Like ta-da, voila
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
and the yellow, drinking magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
On my way to Aspen, I forgot to do my taxes
burned 'em up like Newports
K.E. and Young Future bringing them fire
AMG in a brand new Mercedes
Turn out the lot, I'ma do a 180
For the haters, I'ma go ahead do a 360
Drinking on the Sprite, got lean all in it
I'm a astronaut nigga
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
got 'em out of Magic
and the yellow, drinking magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
Billionaire boy, that's true inspiration
I know tricks like Criss Angel
I double back like two cups
Fishtailing out the parking lot leaving Magic
and the yellow, drinking magic
Sipping on the purple and the yellow, drinking magic
