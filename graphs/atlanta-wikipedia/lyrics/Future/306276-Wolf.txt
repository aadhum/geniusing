I was raised up where them wolves at,
slung dope where them killas hung
My auntie's house was a dope house and I slung dope in my longjohns
C Dub doin' 15, got out, doin' another 25
Got the lean molly look in my eyes,
got blood and sweat in my eyes
5D, my phone i, makin' lots of money on my own time
Hard times inspired me, concrete, that lion turf
45, my iron work, I'm a real nigga, that's after birth
Astronaut, and that's after Earth,
Scientology, Tom and Kate
And I know I can whip a cake
This fly shit they try to confiscate, as I sit back and I meditate
A bad bitch with a bad bitch, gone off these Franklins
Gone off these Franklins, yeah gone off these Franklins
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I'm gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
I was raised up where them wolves at
She gone off these Franklins, gone off these Franklins
Aye where the hook at, my nigga?
I used to cook up them cookies and I ain't look back my nigga
Lord I'm prayin' for my demons, MDA in my semen
I was talkin' to God the other day, swear I was leanin'
God forgive me, forgive me, Oh no I didn't do it
But just go right in the booth, and spit my heart and my anger
My closest friends givin' up, man they feelin' like strangers
Aww man, aww man, I should have stayed at Columbia High
I was built for this lifestyle, damn, honestly
