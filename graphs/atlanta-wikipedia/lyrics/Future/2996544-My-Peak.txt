[Intro: Future]
Super
Body full of lean
I don't measure no more, I pour it 'til it's pink
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
My baby mama finna get her masters (bravo!)
I just hit the office, that's the FAFSA (line up)
I don't wanna hear about no masters
I just hit my pastor, it's faster
They gon' point to  Cuba when I pass away
I probably still be ballin' on my Cast Away
I just got a text that say keep goin' (alright, alright)
I just got a check that say keep goin'
Hurricane Jericho
Everything player code,
phone airplane mode
(alright alright)
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the devil, you don't fuck with me
I'ma keep makin', I make extra payments
I'm a free agent like the second Matrix
I'mma make them nations deal us reparations
Been dancing round the town like I was Kevin Bacon
I be doing shit they only think about
I might throw a milli in the Chase account
Nothing come for free, nothing come for free
You might be the devil, you don't fuck with me
Body full of lean
I don't measure no more, pour it til it's pink
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
As I'm lifting up the doors, droppin' ashes on the seat
I ain't barely reached my peak, no
