Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
Dirty got my mind gone, that money got my my mind blown
That money got my mind blown, money got my mind blown
Money got my mind blown blown blown blown
That money got my mind blown, money got my mind blown
Money got my mind blown blown blown blown
The feds tapping phones so I talk in codes
The shit jumping out the gym I ain’t talking pros
I was in the trap when you was
on Myspace
Money on my mind state, increase the crime rate
SS on it and that’s..for south side
We got a problem Houston, they take on style they boostin'
And I ball for the hall of fame - James Worthy!!
And I’m drinking on Magic, (why that?) Yellow & Purple
miss Parker
She super thick, my little college chick
Is she down the kiss another girl she with that freaky shit
