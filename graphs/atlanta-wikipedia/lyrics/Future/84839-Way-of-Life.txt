My shit is all day dawg, I'm not no June
No July
Fore I end up in a box from a shot
Realizin that I gotta go
I'm a lyricist, Ludacris, man we dyin out
Boy im tryin out but the game tough
Lotta playas in my city tryna spit the same stuff
So I change up, like Obama said
Yeah, it's Cole World, but I'm hotter than a sauna bed
Livin like a villan but im chillin if I gots you
True... and by you I mean the microphone
Cause you listen well, so the booth is feelin like a throne
I'm a faucet on the hottest beats
take a seat if you can't stand the rap
Definition of a rat is someone who can't stand the trap
Love to see my car dash (Kardash) but they never keep up..
Get it...keep up....w the...car dash
