I can't even see me
I'm covered in money, I'm covered in money
These bitches, these niggas, they all want something from me
Just stop all the fronting I'll go back to crime, before they try take me to trial
I heard what you told to the judge
I been gettin' money like this for a while
9mm my brother my keeper
Was serving that ether before I did features
My mamacita she know how to greet me
She know how to keep me she bet not get greedy
I hit the lottery
Tell me your thoughts and you better not lie to me
Slangin' narcotic, and I'm a product of my community
And I'm a product
Torching that gas, we torching that gas
We put on that mask and come with that cash
I got a motor from running the border
You know what you know but don't tell it to cops
Ain't leaving no evidence, cut off my locks
Treat me like royalty, do all my chores
Do all my dirty work, fuck all my whores
Fuck with that bitch cause you know that she bi
Working, I'm working and feeding the kids
Your attitude not fitting this situation
Bring me up outta your investigation
I'mma go harder with no limitations
Pay off these lawyers to throw away cases
Don't think the traces can lead out of state
Finally made it, these niggas, they hate it
I could make Franklins do a back-a-flips!
You holding a grudge, I'm holding them slugs
I'm full of them drugs, it's all in my mug
You bitch ass niggas ain't nothing but a clone
Just stop all that frontin'
Stop all that frontin'
