Future Hendrix, forever
The Wizard, Fire Marshall, Super
Maison Margiela forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I rep the hood forever, ever
I rep the city forever, ever
I rep my city forever, ever, yeah!
I had that weed and that molly on me
Put 25 bitches in Margiela
My heart in the ghetto, it's permanent
I'm stuck in the trenches, it's permanent
I swear I be hearing my grand daddy talk to me
They gave me away, I'm a orphan
inside that paddy wagon
I lay 'n' play up in Bora Bora
I keep on moving that work, then I pull off in a spaceship
Maison Margiela forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I rep the hood forever, ever
I rep the city forever, ever
I rep my city forever, ever, yeah!
I growed up with dealers, mane
I worked in the cold with that pole on me
caterings
Put change on your head and you're done
In them Maison's, I find Ya like Jason
That's Maison Margiela, ya follow me?
Maison Margiela forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I'm in designer forever, ever
I rep the hood forever, ever
I rep the city forever, ever
I rep my city forever, ever, yeah!
