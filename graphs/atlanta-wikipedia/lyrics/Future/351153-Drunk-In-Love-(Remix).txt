Ain't no police around here baby I won't judge you
Wee-ow-wee wee-ow-wee
Fuck them bands girl me and you going for a million and a billion
And I can't keep my fucking eyes off you
When a nigga get the pussy I bite her
You call me the young Mike Tyson
Ay, I'm pouring that drink on top of you
And I'mma sip it all off of you
Fucking up the bitch brain
Changing up your last name
Fucking in my gold chains (woo)
Got you higher than an airplane
You get that hyping on that dick, Soul Train
Mix that Spade in that syrup
If I do say so myself
I pour a cup of dirty Sprite
And I drink it by myself
Pussy soaking like some ally water
Did it on the steps
We done did it everywhere
Honest
