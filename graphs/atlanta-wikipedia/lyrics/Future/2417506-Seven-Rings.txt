[Intro]
I told you we get money by the pillow
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them
Started off slizzered, they callin' me The Wizard
Killers all I know, fill 'em up with the dough
This bitch from Guyana
I pray that my young nigga don't kill you on camera
You come too close, nigga, I'ma have to kill you on camera
I hate to discuss it
If Bubba don't trust you, nigga, you know I don't trust you
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
Chillin' with my family, hangin' low, I embrace them
Heater on your side, it's a hundred percent chance
We come from the bottom, upper echelon
I just hope she washed her mouth out before you kiss her
I had an Arizona plug, used to serve me
I throwed that money in the bag cause it was dirty
He got that chopper on him now and he hurtin'
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for certain
I know he 'bout to let it go and that's for sure
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Most my niggas pop Xans unemployed
I can't stop, I'm goin' in, steroids
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
(I tried to tell you)
I'm washin' off my hands with the mula like it's Ajax
Sippin' out my cup, hell no, don't you taste that
Hundred percent chance I done doped up and laced that
My left and right hand Robert Horry
My left and right hand Robert Horry
Plus my nigga pop Xans unemployed
I tried to tell you when I came, it was God
