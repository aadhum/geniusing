The top come out the Lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
I came up from out the 'partments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
Young Pluto is out the trenches, but I’m big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
Rags to riches, fuck these snitches I ain't scared, bruh
Yeah my left wrist cost a bird, I'm a Tropicana serve
Shorty unsure, hope we don’t do no sherm
Came from out the Kirk, made myself a don
my check on Jose Canseco
The top come out the Lamb cause I'm a super trapper
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
Hard top Rari, Double R, hey, that's Mercedes
I came up from out the 'partments where they trigger happy
Bought my bitch a brand new Rollie and she still ain't happy
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I'm laughing at ya
Young Pluto is out the trenches, but I'm big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
All these foreigns got me lookin' inconsiderate
I got Benjamins, they taller than a mountain
Got that Cartier with diamonds and I’m laughing at ya
Young Pluto is out the trenches, but I’m big and badder
I can't never go back broke and that what really matter
I still will push the line nigga Julius Peppers
Paid cash, it's very hard for me to do rentals
Sober lady you betrayed and got deflated
I'm trying pick, this young bitch gon' be my lady
I got bitches, different flavor, this one Cajun
Keep it cordial with these niggas cause they traders
I'm on molly and its pink like it’s Ms. Piggy
My pockets on Fat Albert, I'm a super trapper
Hard top Rari, Double R, hey that's Mercedes
My pockets on Fat Albert I'm a super trapper
