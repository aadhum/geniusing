And fuck the Washington's and Lincolns
I want bigger bills
Give my heart and soul to ya'll
Forget about the rest of me
Please,........except my brain cause I'm insane son
Idolized these rappers way before I had became one
But.. I ain't a rapper I just learned to talk
Over melodies, and take my listeners for verbal walks
I'm flowin deadlier than cancer be
Future such a problem, ain't nobody got the answer sheet...
Plus I'm the shit I know you peep the smell
Lyrically and sexually she say I'm always deep as hell
Somethin like the ocean cause her throat is goin deep as well
feel like I need an L
Always got them bars like a nigga fell asleep in jail
