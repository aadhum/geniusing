Two cups nigga got the red in me
The Ku Klux Klan and the streets with me
The molly cross got me like a zombie
Her waist line small and that booty look dummy
She just did some alcohol and she about to go dummy
I done kept the water all night, fuck it keep it running
Gotta call a no fly treaty, cause of my necklace
Nigga talking crazy tryna get the club shot up
Do it gang territory,
Christian L's on me this is not a fairy tale
A couple bales on me I just got it out the mail
Dom Perignon let the champagne spill
You gotta use Waze just to get through the crib
I just bring my bands up on a weekday
Gotta keep a hammer on the seat
I gotta switch my gun up every week baby
