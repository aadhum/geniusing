Aye, I'm Michael Jordan bitch in every city (Every city)
I got a main girl and a mistress
I'm F.L.Y
I'm out yo league
They come in dark skin, white, spanish japanese
Light skin girls wanna join the nigga team
Michael Jordan status nigga I got six rings
All about the benjamins
Strapped up in the club like Shyne and dem
I'm rolling strong weed inside the Phantom
My money taller than Bill Cartwright
I'm rocking Michael Jordan's but I think I'm Michael Knight
Ugh, young P Diddy in my city mane
Puff Daddy!
Ugh, I got more blocks than Mutombo
Shotout my accountant
Cause I need some help to count it
The ferrari loud, I went and mount it first day out the county
Like MJ, I'm a team player
So I'mma fuck her friends too
Top drop in East Atlanta and it's painted North Carolina blue
