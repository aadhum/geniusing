Even I look at my diamonds sometimes and kiss em
That's why my x my x and I don't miss her
The way she acting right now I should of pimped her
Throwing shots of liquor on my liver my nigga
Even my niggas know I love em my niggas
And ain't no love for you hoes you hoes crazy
And we ain't neva gone fold we stay faded
Yeah we stay faded
Ain't no water running down my eyes
Ain't no love for the other side
The way these diamonds twinkle all in ya eyeball
I know it should of been a crime dawg by law
I'm counting that cake trimming my nail off
And when times was hard I move a bail off
And when I'm whipping them lanes I'm in that new spurr
I'm getting crazy money with them new orleans niggas
I could of fucked her from the start and put her on a camera
