(Whatchutola, what, whatchutola
Graduated from the fabricated sabotages
Conversated with a lady goin' Lambo crazy
Bitch, you better cut it, shawty, I'm 'bout to cut you off
Oh, you greedy in Tahiti
Aye, tell that girl you 'bout to settle, whatchu tired of?
Can you sell a kilo? Help a nigga move a kilo
Oh, you want the private jet to take a flight to Rio
Can't no Maybach prevent a nigga from makin' mula
Oh, you gold diggin' diggin' graveyard loser
Ain't none of my cars American, King of Zamunda
Backseat of the Benzo, the AMG

I told the girl I'm 'bout to sell the Porsche, I'm tired of it
She go and told these folks I'm goin' broke, a smile poured
From my lips, cuz if I'm broke, it's only hearted
Broken records from broken English, that's all it
Hol' up and if I were, why? Would you throw a party?
Affection is so convenient when ballin'
Correction: these hoes don't mean it when fallin'
I guess that's why Lois can't be with Clark Kent
Fly on a nigga back while he Superman
But if I'm in a wheelchair, you still there?
The shit is the Pittsburgh, I still care
White button downs and Emory scrubs
Had to write her birthday down because my memory sucks
But this shit comes back up like some acid reflux
Or a Michael Jackson jacket with some plastic zippers
I was zippin' through the city and I don't give a fuck
1994 Toyota Land Cruiser because
That bitch ain't never broke down on me, why would I do that to her?
Simplism, symbolism, I'll pull up at a club
And might not never buy a new car again, if I can help it
Cause if I buy one, they gon sell ten, then what I'm left with?
Throw a nigga one on the strength, then we might could talk
Til' then, I will ride my fuckin' bike, or walk

Yeah, she love her country but hate American cars
If yellow seems to be the color in fashion
What happens to all of this good black pussy he keep ignorin'?
The world told him didn't shit rhyme with orange
The girl is only with him because he's tourin'
Well go on angel
She's so materialistic
I'm just enjoyin' life, I'm livin' life, you know?
Pull up at this girl crib bumpin' Lil' Boosie, yeah
