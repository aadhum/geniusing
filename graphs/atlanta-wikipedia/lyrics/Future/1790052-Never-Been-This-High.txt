Yeah, I ain’t never been this high
You ain’t never been this high
Alligator on my shirt I been too consistent
I had a beeper in the kindergarten with a gerry curl
I’m shinin like Vvs’s I was born shinin’
Matter of fact I should’ve been a diamond
My left wrist Aquafina and these girls im with from Argentina
Body flooded up with ice name a rapper cleaner
It’s like my body made of diamonds, I can’t stop shinin’
