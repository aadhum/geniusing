Broken lies
Driving backwards
Making all the wrong turns
Saying all the wrong words
Dodging angels
Oh, let's not be alone
Let's not be alone
Let's be one
Oh, let's not be alone
Empty thoughts fill the room
Breathe for me and I'll breathe for you
Let's be selfish, selfish, baby
I just hit the lick, south of France
Currency exchange, lookin' fancy
If that money dirty, make it dance
25 karats cost a mansion
Gold rose petals, bottle standin'
Came from the concrete, takin' chances
Pop gold Ace like a Xanny
Roses turn into dust
