If you ain't fuckin' with my campaign ain't no love for you
I went from sellin' cocaine to my auntie and dem
Dem same niggas I grew up with I be clubbing with dem
We whipping Maseratis back-to-back we lovin' this shit
I drink my lean I roll my bud I do my dirt wit' dem
You got my back I gotcho' back I'm breakin' bread wit' dem
I got your girl askin' your FreeBand niggas wasup wit' dem
Dem goonie goon niggas them my partners
Serve crack, buy a old-school Impala
Lit up a blunt, the blunt right here for niggas dead and gone
That interstate, that interstate, takin' that ride
