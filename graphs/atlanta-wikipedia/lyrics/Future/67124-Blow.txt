Blow that money like a candle, blow
Blow that kush like a candle, blow
Blow that money like a candle, blow
Blow that kush like a candle, blow
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
All the jewels I made, I need a gold medal
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Ludacris I'm a legend
So still drive in my Ac'
Took two years on just to raise my cup
Worth a 100 fucking mill
Niggas can't keep up
Got a safe filled up with dirty money like Kaleena
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
40 racks stuffed down In my denim, I blow it
Take a gram of Kush and roll it in a blunt I blow it
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
Blow, blow, blow that money like a candle
Blow, blow, blow that kush like a candle!
