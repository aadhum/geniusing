It’s that EVOL, ah
Hey, thirty thousand on a watch, I swear thank God I’m ballin’
Feds watching on my spot, they say somebody called ‘em
Hottest nigga in the streets, they see my Audemars
Boston George, I’m with that game, you got that girl that blow
Catch me pissing out the codeine from the night before
This for G-rod, C-Rod, all these niggas banging B’s
You want an R&B chick, shawty it ain’t nothin’ to get her
You want to drive around in that Rolls, you know it ain’t nothin’ to get her
I throw that grams of boy, I’m servin’ in the cold
Got fifty eight.. grams of boy, we servin’ pita
They say they got Magnolia shawty bangin’ needles
They trapped out Angola, they was out the NOLA
Then fuck around and then know you, got to be a cobra
They cooped up with that yola, now that cook Coke Cola
My water whippin’ issues now we packin pistols
Bodies came around, he shot ‘em on a bike
Oh he poppin’ wheelies, a lil Haiti baby
Oh they say that nigga he just a lil Haiti baby
Oh they say that boy he just a lil Haiti baby
Shoot in broad day, he shoot in broad day
Shot the whole window up in broad day
Oh that’s that lil Haiti baby, Haiti baby
Oh that’s that lil Haiti baby, Haiti baby
Dumping down the pills, I feel my head explodin’
I just wanna go back to the Bentley store
I just wanna go back to the Lamb’ store
I just wanna buy another Rover though
Bodies came around, he shot ‘em on a bike
Oh he poppin’ wheelies, he a lil Haiti baby
Oh they say that nigga, he a lil Haiti baby
Oh they say that boy, he a lil Haiti baby
Shoot in broad day, he shoot in broad day
Shot the whole window up in broad day
Oh that’s that lil Haiti baby, Haiti baby
Oh that’s that lil Haiti baby, Haiti baby
Dumpin’ back these pills, I feel my head explodin’
Pull up in that ‘Rari, ain’t no no Facade
Pull up in that ‘Rari, ain’t no no Facade
