Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches
Two cups, toast up with the gang
From food stamps to a whole 'nother domain
Out the bottom, I'm the livin' proof (Super)
Ain't compromising, half a million on the Coupe
Drug houses, lookin' like Peru
Graduated, I was overdue
Pink molly, I can barely move
Ask about me, I'm gon' bust a move
Rick James,
thirty-three chains
Ocean air, cruisin' Biscayne
Top off, thatâ€™s a liability
Hit the gas, boostin' my adrenaline
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches
Four-door Maybach; I drive anything
Buy my Range, make 'em go insane
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
My guillotine, drank promethazine
Tec and beams, go to those extremes
Parliament, calamari Wednesday
Parlay in Vegas, we was in attendance
Before the business, Theodore lenses
Intermission, never take a break
Switch states, touch down, foreign plates
We call the play, we didn't come to play
They gang, they gang, we gang, but they are not the same (Freebandz)
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Rep the set, gotta rep the set
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Percocets, molly, Percocets
Chase a check, never chase a bitch
Don't chase no bitches
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
(Cold chills, prison cells)
(Oh my Lord, praise him be)
