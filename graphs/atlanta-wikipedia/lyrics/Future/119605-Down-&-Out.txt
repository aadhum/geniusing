When I was down and out
You always showed me love
More money more problems
man this shits hilarious
I got baby mama drama, this shit embarrassing
Once you get the fame, it’s consequences that come with it
Sometimes you wanna wake up and just say I’m done with it
Now I made it and I’m famous
Emotionally you drain me
I smoke a pound of that kush
And blow out the stress I’m thinking
I sip on codeine, I’m sippin it till my body numb
silk medusa sheets
Before I made a dollar, I was lying to the streets
