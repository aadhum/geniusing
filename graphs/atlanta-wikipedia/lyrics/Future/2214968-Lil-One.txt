See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma keep that cash on him
I'ma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on 'em
Nigga gon' keep that mask on 'em
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nig keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap, target
Solitaires on me, no cards
Niggas gon' pull up and spray in broad
Got that yopper on him right now
And he ready to pull up right now
Choppa hit a nigga with the scope
Fuck that pussy shit, we sellin' dope
Turn the hood into Iraq
On the corner, flippin' that pack
AK-47 and lortabs
Drugs, a pound of fuckin' Percocets
Fell asleep and woke up with that yopper
See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on him
I'mma keep that cash on
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nigga keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap
Travel, that 44. camouflage
AR & Tec, that's a real menage
Jump out the side of a caravan
Flippin' that work, you the middle man
Roxies
Pour the four and cut the four
They come and kick in your front door
Those goonies  got hoodies and money
Frank Lucas, a role model
See, my lil one keep that mask on
I'mma keep that cash on him
I'mma keep that cash on
I'mma do the dash
Now, don't make me drop a bird on ya
I'm gon' drop a bag on ya
I'm gon' drop that bag on ya
Don't make me drop that bag on ya
Ay my lil nigga keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
Nigga gon' keep that mask on
My lil nigga keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on 'em
Gotta keep that Mac on, that rap-pap-pap-pap, target
