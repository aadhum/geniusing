I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that
I smell that mula, that fetti, I’m coming after that
I’m living this life of sin, what’s coming after that?
One whip whipped up, ten whips came after that
White gold come after that
Got Audemars coming after that
Presidentials coming after that, VVS’s coming after that
OG coming after that, good kush lean coming after that
Clearport, no TSA, lil Mexico my drinking place
I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that
I smell that mulah, that fetti, I’m coming after that
I’m living this life of sin, what’s coming after that?
Hollygrove my habitat, wish I could bring Rabbit back
call a ho a ho and a rat a rat
ain’t looking good like cataracts
Them feds tryna throw me in the box, I’m like fuck that, throw Jack in that
I'ma get that pussy wet, her other nigga just dampen that
He buy shit, he pamper that, she tapping out when I’m tapping that
Tryna get as high as me nigga, then where the fuck is your scaffold at?
Niggas flip facts like acrobats, I click clack, what comes after that?
I got them young niggas tweaking like where them drugs at
I make them old head niggas go get they plug back
You whipping up in the foreign, them hoes love that
I smell that mula, that fetti, I’m coming after that
I’m living this life of sin, what’s coming after that?
