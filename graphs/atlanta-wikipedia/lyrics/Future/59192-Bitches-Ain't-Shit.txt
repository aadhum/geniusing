These bitches ain't shit
She'll fuck your homeboy, she'll take your money
She'll take off running, where the fuck she going
These bitches ain't shit
I'm international and you American, it ain't no comparison
I know your type
Like I know that ice, and you foogazi
Come take this pipe, can't even take it
Wake up every single morning with that dick on your breath
When you hitting these bitches don't take off your ice
It's 4 a.m., when I'm leaving the bar, cause I'm a star
We fucking on top of these covers, I gotta keep it gutta
Cause she ain't got no stamina, say she trash
Excuse my manners, here go a bag
