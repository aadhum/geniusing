Hey I'm trippin
On a whole damn bean, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
With my girl best friend, I'm trippin'
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
Woke up, seen a UFO
Last night I smoked a pound of dro
Swear a nigga just seen a ghost
That money comin' in overflow
Codeine all in my Sprite,
Future live the rockstar life
Astronaut at the same time,
Pluto, Jupiter, same time, pick a planet at the same time
my girl gon' have a fit when
She find out how hard I'm diggin'
her friend, shit, I'm trippin'
And I'm in NASA blowin' strong, what the fuck I'm on?
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
you trip and you chatter
I dirty my Sprite, put it down in my kidneys
I crumble my kush and fill my blunt up
I'm blackin' out on track, like I don't know where I'm at
Talk to Scotty and he talk right back
Countin' money, palms still itchy
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
I'm smokin' presidential,
drankin' yellow,
Fucked up in the Phantom like Tony Montana,
Your girl down on my head, she grippin' that head just like a wave cap
And I get them bottles poppin', Juicy J don't save caps
rack to rack,
And I keep a dime bitch on my side, plus a nina
And they both will get you wet like Aquafina
Smoked a whole pound of green, I'm trippin'
Drunk a whole thing of lean, I'm trippin'
Fucked around, popped a bean
