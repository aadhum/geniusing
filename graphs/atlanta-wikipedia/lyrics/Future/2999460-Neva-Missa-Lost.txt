Who are you again? Why are you in my bed?
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
And you know it, and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
I'm losin' you and you know it
You know, you know
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
I can never miss a loss
Please tell me what it cost
Make me pull this money out the drawer
I whip one to two, I sold one to three
That's why I never took a loss
See, I got many types of flaws
That's why I never miss a loss
Sagittarius
Whatever you need
Keep on my lenses, I don't see these niggas
They too busy tryna be niggas
Purple Addys, no sleep
Take the jet so we can meet quicker
Her ass thick, but my syrup thicker
I'm on it right away
Uh oh, uh uh uh, whatever you need
Whatever you need, I can never miss a loss
Whatever you need, ohhhhh, I can never miss a loss
Yeah yeah, whatever you need, neeeed
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
