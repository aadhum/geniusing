My goons get it done with a mac 11
We on that dope and that mud shit
Niggas try to flex they
We cut 'em off and bought some better choppas
Wanna fuck some commas up at my dealer
Fuck you lemma up doin' numbers
For the few chains, that a new rari
I done took this pain and I'm noddin' off
I'm in that new Range, give a fuck about 'em
Grippin' grain on the Mulsanne
Sippin' drank at the Blue Flame
Hit the booth, let the booth flame
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing it
I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over now
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
Dawg, I'm over that
All that old shit, y'all niggas still doing
My goons get it done with a mac 11
