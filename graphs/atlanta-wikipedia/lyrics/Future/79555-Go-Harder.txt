I done been lied to
I been neglected
I done had all kind of people turn against
Me
You try to bring me down ima go harder
You try to bring me down ima go harder
I done been lost
I done been crossed I done heard all kind
Of rumors that were false
You try to bring me down ima go harder
You try to bring me down ima go harder
You can't break me,I'm solid
I break laws
Don't never abide by it
I let my hater be my motivator and keep
Grindin'
I learned that free band shit cuz free band
Shit clothing line I designed it
They try to show and prove
If I can take a bullet then I can take
The rumors
Through all the losses I never lost my sense of
Humor
