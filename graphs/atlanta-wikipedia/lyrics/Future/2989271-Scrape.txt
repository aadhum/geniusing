Skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt
Cookin' up chicken like Gladys
Stayin' up late on addies
Caddy
Cranberry guts with the 'matic
Throw half a brick at Magic
Betty Crocker sippin' on muddy
Pyrex pot and the 40
This'll get a slow trap scorchin'
If it ain't hot, it ain't rollin'
Twenty-four seven ain't closin
They got my name at the Precinct
I put a lotta bands on another rinse
Got a lotta bands on me, outta drench
I got re-rock on me, got fish
I got a kilo, Cuban on my wrist
I served junkies, then I made a hit
I got my fork and my work and my syrup
I got my recipe goin'
You see me just splashin' and play with that girl
You already know what I'm doin'
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Make me have to put it in a Pamper
Arm & Hammer made me stronger
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
Scrape it out the pot when I cook it
