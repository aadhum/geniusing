I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
I just keep on grinding, stacking up my lumber
Rackin' up them Benjamins,
I blast off like Jetsons
Plugged in with the Haitians, I keep it real with my Mexicans
Belt by Ferragamo
shoes by Chanel
Cook that good dope and I can eyeball a bale
my Rolly
flooded my wrist is
Audemar is stainless, ain't got no diamonds
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
Big rocks - Fred Flintstone
Michael Jackson high, call me Thriller
Playin' poker for a hundred bands, I'm the dealer
Casino â€“ Ex Drug Dealer
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
Spend a hundred racks on blue jeans, got good weed, got good lean
I'm turnin' up, you go to sleep
I whipped me up that V12
I pull up in that V12
I got a hundred bands in my email
My mind stay on stacks
My niggas movin' them packs
I ran the stacks like tracks
I can't tell what the time is, I just keep on shining
I can't tell what time it is, I just keep on shining
I just keep on shining, I just keep on shining
