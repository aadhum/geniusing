I'm a stone cold guerrilla
it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
LV on my three phones
I'm 3D, I'm HD, these movies that I make
I’m a titan,
I fly in, like a pelican
I'm organized like a crime boss, I'm up there like a mafia
That's a fresh new Balenciaga, all dreaded up like a Rasta
Got a million soldiers on my roster
I’m known in Bal Harbour
I'm a stone cold guerrilla
it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
pass me my sprite
I’m an ATLien and they say I’m way way out of sight
Aye that baby bottle syrup, man that shit keep me on point
I’m rollin’ big blunts, gotta keep some ganja down my lungs
Mix it up - mix it up, mix it up
Pour it up - pour it up, pour it up
Styrofoam
I'm screwed up: Lil' Flip, game over
I'm a stone cold guerrilla
it’s in my DNA
I be trappin', getting’ that cake, it’s in my DNA
Had to skeet it in her face, she caught my DNA
Got a bitch in every state, it’s in my DNA
