I've been in the stu late, workin', no residuals
Matter of fact, you wanna come to Pluto?
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
She got a few athletes on speed dial
I'm tryna get the case dismissed before I see trial
And these codeine habits ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
No this codeine ain't got nothin' to do with my lil' child
I used to sell dope at my grandma's house, as a rude child
And these chains clinkin' back and forth, they too loud
Left every pair of Margielas at the condo
Technically I never packed up and leave
Left 80 racks in the dresser, you can keep
I cooked it up and then I went global
My baby mama push a Range Rover
Had to make sure I got it fully loaded
If you the one, then God will let me know
I'm paranoid, I gotta ride with one
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Standin' on Black Sox, meet me at the yacht dock
Icin' out the clock, watch, bitches on my cock
Pinstripes on a hardtop Bugatti
She told me she was an angel
She fucked two rappers and three singers
And I had to tell her 'bout Miami
After she came with no panty
Won't get a response from me, ain't no confessions
Before I tell a lie, won't tell you nothin'
Any time I got you, girl you my possession
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
Even if I hit you once, you part of my collection
