Talkin’ ’bout ya bussin’ heads, nigga you ain’t shot shit
Talkin’ ’bout ya bussin’ clips, nigga you ain’t
Oh you done and got all them guns and you ain't killed nobody yet?
How many times you shot that motherfucker nigga?
Ain’t nobody popped up dead
I thought yall niggas murderers
Shit
Bought the ho a hundred pair of red bottoms
That’s a quarter milli on a hand job my nigga
Go and put a nigga on a picture
Go and put a nigga on a t-shirt
Nigga I’m a codeine buyer

Represent your gang, nigga throw it up
I don’t give a fuck where you at, nigga throw it up
Nigga what’s the color of them bottles? They ain’t gold

You ain’t even sticking to the code
Pimps up, pimps up, hoes down, hoes down
