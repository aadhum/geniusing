Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
Don't tell nobody
Keep quiet, keep quiet, keep quiet
'Cause you gon' start a riot
Go to Paris, do the dashboard
See the wheel on the right side
Got her driving on the wrong side
Thought we was driving on the wrong side
VVS' wasn't given to me
Call me up and let me get right
double M
Like you signed to Maybach dem
