[Hook: Future]
Talkin' bout ya poppin' tags, nigga, you ain't bought shit
Talkin' bout 100 bottles, nigga, you ain't pop shit
All you talk nana clips, nigga, you ain't shot shit
Spendin' money on these hoes, nigga, you ain't fuck shit
Shit, shit
How you movin' round with ya ho?
You ain't even stickin' to the code
[Verse 3: Future]
Buy the ho 100 pair of red bottoms
That's a quarter milli on a hand job, my nigga
Brrrrr! Stick'em
Fuck you and every nigga came with ya
Go and put a nigga on a picture
Go and put a nigga on a T-shirt
Back in the day when a nigga sell dope
I'mma slap your daddy out and then put him in a hole
Glock 40, whooo! Turn up, turn up
My ambitions as a rider
Sippin' on lean, gettin' higher
Nigga, I'm a codeine buyer
Know you not a foreign whip driver
Shout out to the shooters and the shooters only
You never walk around with a lot of money
Bundles fallin' all out your pocket
When you hit him in the head, can you keep a solid?
Bulletproof whip, we'll blow it up
Like some raw uncut, don't blow it up
Represent your gang, nigga, throw it up
I don't give a fuck where you at, nigga, throw it up
