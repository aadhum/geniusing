Freeband Gang
All it took was some patience--Niggas still hatin'
Hell ya, bout that lifestyle, Pradas on me right now
All that damn finessin' and I took off like the Jetsons
All it took was some patience--Niggas still hatin
I'ma whip up in them foreigns make you envy me nigga
I'm gone whip up in them foreigns make you envy me nigga
I was fucked up and starvin', I go stand right in that trap
I'm bout to sell me some yayo
I gotta jug out in Clay Co
I woke up in that Bugatti, went and bought me three Lambs
That's an Aventador nigga, that cost a hundred a piece
I went so hard in the streets, I'm bout to have me a feast
All it took was some patience--Niggas still hatin
