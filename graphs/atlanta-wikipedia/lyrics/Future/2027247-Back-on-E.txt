I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
While my pockets on E
It's fuck you, pay me
Somebody save me
Or should I say save this nigga
Cause when my pockets on E
They all looking like victims
I pop a transformer, transform ya (Do you wanna lay?)
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
My heater to capacity
My pockets full of capacity
And I'm rolling baby, with a Nike sign and two naked ladies
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
I'm back on E
I got a full tank of gas
In the driveway countin' up this cash, now
I'm back on E
With a bag full of waters
If I drink 'em then I know I'm rolling harder
I'm back on E
