Super Future
I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
Just a young ass nigga I was dead broke
Two hundred on the dash, baby this is not a Jaguar
You don’t have to ask, keep that hammer on me, MC
You show these niggas love and they gonna show you a barrel
It’s Taliban gang, we in a whole ‘nother era
Our money ain’t the same, I’m in a whole ‘nother bracket
It’s five thousand or better, what I spend on a jacket
They gon’ shoot you in the head if you the police
I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke
I’m ‘bout to cash out on a new Bugatti
I’m ‘bout to pay the police off, John Gotti
They mixin’ Actavis in with the molly
You niggas wanna go to war, it’s like in ISIS
He got Freebandz tatted ‘cross his stomach
I’m ‘bout to smash the prosecutor and the attorney
I wake up, go and blow a dime off in Barneys
I’m tryna fuck the DA lady in her mouth though
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke
Hit some R&B shit on the jet though
I got stacks on me, got stacks on me like Alpo
As a young ass nigga I was dead broke
