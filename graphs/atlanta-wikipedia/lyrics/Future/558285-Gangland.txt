Future Hendrix
I'm the one who got the presi' flooded
You the type to get ya man indicted
I'm the type to pull up in a Spider
I'm the type to drive a Hummer
It's dirty when it got a homi on it
I'm the one that put that dirty in the cup
Had you sippin', noddin' off nigga
You was gettin' fronted, runnin' off nigga
I made myself to a boss nigga
This money put a lot of demons in me
Then we throw a Pat Riley on em
These commas coming in
These haters coming in
My baby mama tryna sue again
Got the Federallies on a nigga chin
I'm full of syrup and I'm seeing ghosts
Runnin that pack through Chi Town, Memphis, All up through B More & DC
Lil' Mexico turf a gang land
I'm ABK like I'm Zonaman
That's Any Body Killa nigga
100 thousand for a lawyer, gotta be a Johnnie Cochran
Free Band Gang President
Lil' Mexico turf a gang land
I'm ABK like I'm Zonaman
That's Any Body Killa nigga
100 thousand for a lawyer, gotta be a Johnnie Cochran
