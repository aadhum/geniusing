[Hook: Future]
All my ice and all my trees, all my bitches in love with me
Rock star life, the life we lead, surrounded by rock stars
I seen my first M and damn near went crazy
I went and bought a Ghost and tried to crash a Mercedes
All my ice and all my trees, all my bitches in love with me
Rock star life, the life we lead, surrounded by a bunch of stars
How I'm gonna come on it, I just cum on it
Special Olympics, I'mma go dumb on it
No bike tricks, but I'mma stunt on it
A nigga talk slick, I'mma get Stun on it
Be clear, cover Marie Claire
Million dollar show in India, she's there
My own drink, Moscato Myx now
They seen Freaks, so it's pasties on they tits now
Cuban link up, queue the Brinks truck
If I was a nigga, I'd be getting my dick sucked
Diamonds on my wrist, di-diamonds on my wrist
Jason the jeweler
They gotta send an M, if she's leavin' the coast
I was done rocking my chains
