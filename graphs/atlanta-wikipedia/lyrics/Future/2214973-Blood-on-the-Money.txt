They gave lil Trotty 25 for them thangs, nigga

They walk up on you, give it to you, see your friends, nigga
Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money.... all day
I heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood hot
We've been at the laundromat all day
We've been washin' money.... all day
Heard the police lookin' for me cause I got the hood
It got blood on that money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
I hang with all the killers and the robbers
I pour me up some drank, say "Fuck my problems"
My hood, they treat me like I'm El Chapo
I keep that dog food like I'm Ralo
I had the warrant in Clayco and beat the case
The Federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
They got girl on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it
I take a dose of them pills and I get real low in the field
I share the mansion with goonies, I shared the bitch with a goonie
I took the mack in Bal Harbor, niggas ain't slippin', we got 'em
Ask me do I know how to whip it
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
She put me off and it was ugly
I made a million dollars, say she love me
The way she did me, it destroyed me
I kept it real with lil' shorty
I dropped out of school and I get money like Meech
You see how things change?
I came from cocaine
It got blood on the money and I still count it
They got blood on the money and I still count it
I can't help the way I'm raised up
That Easter Pink, I tried to give it up, I can't give it up
The federales fuckin' with my nigga Ty
It's Black Amigo Gang 'til a nigga die
They got girls on the money and I still count it
They got boy on the money, watch my nigga count it
