Got a Rollie on, got reverse doors
They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Trying to sabotage a nigga, gettin cash-flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we getting mad dough
They got mad love for us, gonna stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gone spray that way
Outside niggas infiltrating, don't play around, don't play with me
Outside niggas come around, we gone spray em down like fireman
Whipping the dope like it's Anna Mae, shootin a nigga like John K
Got mojo, got mojo
Driving a boat on them xans
Pour out a four in Japan, selling that dope out of France
Drinking on Texas like I'm a Ranger
We laying you down like a carpenter
I toss it up with all my day one niggas
Got a Rollie on, got reverse doors
They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Trying to sabotage a nigga, gettin cash-flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we getting mad dough
They got mad love for us, gonna stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gone spray that way
Outside niggas infiltrating, don't play around, don't play with me
Outside niggas come around, we gone spray em down like fireman
Celine, Celine baby, I got the rings on me like Pippen
That's ya bitch? I'ma gone mingle
I got my BM pushin' a beamer
Gotta keep M's like it's a Nina
Nine millimeter my little nigga
Got a Rollie on, got reverse doors
They got mad love for us, we getting mad dough
Trying to sabotage a nigga, gettin cash-flow
We don't respect none of you niggas, we getting mad dough
They got mad love for us, gonna stay that way
We got mad goons on deck, they gone spray that way
Outside niggas infiltrating, don't play around, don't play with me
Outside niggas come around, we gone spray em down like fireman
