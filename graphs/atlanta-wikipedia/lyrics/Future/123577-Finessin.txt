Yeah, F.B.G
We global now nigga
we went from rags to riches
cooking up that Young Poochie
Beamer coup with a clear view,
Trapped out, I'm on CNN,
spaceship I done went to Mars
Gotta model bitch who can take the dick,
got a gutter bitch who can take a charge
Went to Paris on a weekday, and I'm coming back in a couple months
Trading in my hand scale, started selling them big bells
cashing out for a hundred pounds
Sell a nigga some A-1,
we went from rags to riches
Fuck with me, my lick game, I'm hitting licks excite me
I'm taking off like MJ
That pink inside my Styrofoam,
Money talk no pressure, everything disrespectful
we went from rags to riches
