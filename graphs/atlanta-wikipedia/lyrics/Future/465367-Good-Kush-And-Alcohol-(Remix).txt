I'm on that good kush and alcohol
I got some down bitches I can call
I don't know what I would do without y'all
I'mma ball til the day I fall

Yeah, long as my bitches love me (yeah, yeah)
I can give a fuck 'bout no hater
Long as my bitches love me
I can give a fuck 'bout no niggas
Long as these bitches love me
I suffered like immigrants, now my bitches immigrants
Young niggas ain’t got remorse, they shootin' at your innocence
OG, Granddaddy, blowing like a chimney
And I love this life, and I won’t trade it for the world
