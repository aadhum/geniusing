I wear Gucci, I wear bailey, at the same damn time
Fucked your sister and your girl at the same damn time
All these diamonds that I rock could make a bitch go blind
Yella ice, white ice at the same damn time
Walkin’ straight through the club, I don’t stand in no line
And my glasses Jimmy Jewels but I got them Gucci shoes
With a Louis belt and Prada bag, I swear I’m so confused
Vista Lenox Mall
Serve my baby momma brother, got the same ole grind
Sellin’ bricks, sellin’ bales at the same damn time
Went and bought two sixty twos
Rock an AP and a Rolly, at the same damn time
At the same damn time, at the same damn time
But I got two platinum artists
Middle finger up, to the mother fucking law
sick with the cross like DeRon going off
Crocodile kicks like my hood the Everglades
my Rollie on ice
