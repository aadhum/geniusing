My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
I'm spiked up like a bad drink
I woke up this evenin'
And I seen a demon
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
duckin' one time
Nigga ain't make it to see it
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
My pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
Pain runnin' deeper than the ocean
