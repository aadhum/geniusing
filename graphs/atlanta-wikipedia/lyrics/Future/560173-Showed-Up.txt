I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein
Smashin' on a trophy
I might OD
I just came from Oslo, Norway, everything was gourmet
A couple million worth in whips when I step out my doorway
I just, I just, I just throwed a bird away in Lenox
Went to Magic, throwed some racks, and nigga I ain't finished
Baby promise me you'll never go trip on what I be sippin'
I was drugged up on so many drugs
I just showed up in this bitch with some Latin Kings and some Bloods
I came through that bitch with 4 Trey and my cuz
We screamin' "ABK" nigga so you know what it was
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein
I'm Pablo, El Chapo to these lil' niggas
I just, I just bought my bitch a new Celine
I'm pimpin' on some bitches, call me Future Don Juan
And I'm Lil' Mexico until the Lord come get me
I was drugged up on so many drugs
I just showed up in this bitch with some Latin Kings and some Bloods
I came through that bitch with 4 Trey and my cuz
We screamin' "ABK" nigga so you know what it was
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein
I just downed a whole eighth of codeine
My young nigga have you smelling like some sardines
I just scored some work and I'ma serve every dope fiend
Fixin' up the molly with the Sprite like it's protein
