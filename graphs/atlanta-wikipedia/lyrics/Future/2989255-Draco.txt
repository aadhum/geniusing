Pluto
Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
You ain't never ever get your bitch back
Lamborghini doors when I lift off
Did the Heisman on the hoe got the stiff arm
Fuck all that biting like Tyson or Holyfield
A couple of pills and I got my soda filled
Woah whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I've been drippin' like a God, what else?
I been dodgin' all the flage, what else?
I been fillin' up garages, what else?
I gave her her first ménage, what else?
Pink molly, let me dance with her (yup)
Sky Dweller, it was sentimental
Rose gold, it was cinnamon
Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Hundreds on hundreds, got a good batch
I got to train my bitches
I'm putting chains on my bitches
Molly off-white, done got to me
35 bitches at the St. Reg
Fall back shooter like KD
Back in the kitchen with Curry
Pineapple drink lookin' syrupy
56 nights, I was dirty
Styrofoam cups servin' patients
Heard you been talkin' bout the kid
Knowin' damn well that’s a flagrant (technical)
Draco season with the bookbag
Rat tat, got a little kick back
Can't tell she got teeth
I was in her mouth like veneers
Stop comparing my career
Designer flooded through the crib
Middle fingers up, fuck the pigs
Certified nigga out the six
Keep on goin' in on this song
Keep an F&N at your home
