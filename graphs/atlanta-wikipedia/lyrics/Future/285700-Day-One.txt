I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie
You better come at me correct cause you don’t know me
A half a million round my neck, I'm still the old me
I’m on that sour, nigga, I ain't movin' slowly
Hey! Hey! I got that check on me, I've been like that from day one
I keep my niggas with me, I've been like that from day one
I drive the newest whips, I've been like that from day one
I made that gwala flip, I've been like that from day one
I'm on promethazine,
my coupe the color Akon
I got my hoodie on, ain't goin' not like Trayvon
I'm on my hustle, since a young I learned to stay down
If I fuck yo bitch you tell me can you keep it confidential?
Ain't no pressure on my presidents, these Franklins are official
And my coupe is so official,
riding round with all my pistols
I drive the most expensive cars
That's very fast and very spacious
Aye look at these niggas, they all shooters
We came from the bottom, we eat noodles
Very bad bitches on my radar
You are not a real nigga, nigga you’s a hater
I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie
You better come at me correct cause you don't know me
A half a million round my neck, I'm still the old me
I'm on that sour, nigga, I ain't movin' slowly
Hey! Hey! I got that check on me, I've been like that from day one
I keep my niggas with me, I've been like that from day one
I drive the newest whips, I've been like that from day one
I made that gwala flip, I've been like that from day one
Cuban link I'm rockin' cost two hunned (Shit two hunnda)
Gas prices high, (whew) Exxon (Gas!)
All white foreigns, make em hate some (They hate!)
Designer clothes, look like I shop in London
You talk that plug talk but nigga you don't know one (Trippin')
Bought a brick from me, I sold him a fake one (finesse)
I fuck with them gangstas and them killers
I know bitches realer than you niggas
I know the streets gon' be the streets (I do)
I just fucked up the whole check on my Rollie
You better come at me correct cause you don’t know me
A half a million round my neck, I'm still the old me
I’m on that sour, nigga, I ain't movin' slowly
Hey! Hey! I got that check on me, I've been like that from day one
I keep my niggas with me, I've been like that from day one
I drive the newest whips, I've been like that from day one
I made that gwala flip, I've been like that from day one
