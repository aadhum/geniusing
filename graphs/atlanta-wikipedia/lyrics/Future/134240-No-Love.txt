[Intro]
Even though I’m out here thugging
I’m missing all your touching
I ain’t fell in love with no pussy
I ain’t fell in love with no pussy
Done ran all through the club
Trying to leave a nigga for nothing
I used to see me as your husband
You want all my money
You want all my fame
You want to run to the club
Trying to fuck up my name
I ain’t never been dishonorable
I took a chance
I even took you 'round my homies
Something I never do
I’m drinking and flashing a Rollie
Either you stay or you’re going
I am never going to talk shit but from the beginning I knew I could afford it
Here, carry my 40
And you thought I would.. oh, baby
