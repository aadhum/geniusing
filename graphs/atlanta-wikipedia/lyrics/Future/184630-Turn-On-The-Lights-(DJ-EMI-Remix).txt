Mike WiLL Made It
See, you deserve a night off and I know what to do with it
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth but bitch I need my space
And she gon' ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum anywhere you want, I give her Santa Clause face
That pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up, like some Somalians
She know I got a girl but she keep this shit a thousand
She just be like
This pussy for you
I say come and eat this bone and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered that's a war wound
Girl that pussy too tight, you need a pussy massage
She got a body like a mermaid
she a plus, first aid
Tunechi
I ain't got no worries, no Frank Ocean I'm straight
Just in case I run across her today I'mma stay clean
And tell ‘er I’ve been lookin’ for ‘er with a flashlight
You can't tell a nigga nothin because I got my cash right
And tell ‘er if she honest I promise to stay true
Make sure, when you tell ‘er, tell ‘er we goin past the moon
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er too
I heard she keep her promises, and never turn on you
I heard she ain’t gon cheat and she gon never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need ‘er, she come through
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
Turn on the lights
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
I’m lookin’ for ‘er
