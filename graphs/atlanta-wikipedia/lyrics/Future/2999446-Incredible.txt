It's a light day
Ain't got on nothin' but about $700 thousand worth
That's it
You know what I'm sayin'?
I was havin' trust issues
But I've been havin' way better luck since you
I know it's true love with you
Told myself I don't wanna fall in love with you
Rollin' on the eway speedin'
Friday, just started the weekend
XO textin', you respondin'
Can you stretch it out? Stretch it out for me
I got somewhere to be, but it's hard to leave
When you do it like you mean it, I'm proceedin'
Is you the one? Is you the one?
Then she looked me in my eyes
Told me, "Fuck them pussy niggas
They ain't ridin' 'cause I'm ridin'
And I'm dyin' for you, baby"
In-incredible
In-in-incredible
In-in-incredible
Incredible
We can take Vicodin tonight, baby
We been textin' back and forth
Now it's time to get it crackin'
Girl, take it all out 'cause I know you active
Did you come to talk or is you 'bout that action?
Diamonds on my neck, moonwalkin', Michael Jackson
Hit it from the back, girl, you know I'm goin' ham
Fuck the pigs, girl, you got me feelin' like the man
Yeah, yeah
sprung
Put them diamonds on you, have 'em Billie Jean moonwalkin'
Put them diamonds on you, have 'emmmmm moonwalkin'
These niggas already tryna invade the embassy
The way you move your body, I'ma have a change of plans
In-in-in-incredible
