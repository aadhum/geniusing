You gotta crawl before you walk
You comprehend and then you talk
You live and You learn and it ain't always yo fault
And I just want you hold me down 3-6-5
With no complaining
Relationship get draining
They say success don't change you, it reveal you
How old you say you was? (college girl)
And you sweet too
I would introduce you to my sweet tooth
But I ain't get the chance to personally meet you
But I must say it was nice to meet you
And I hope you don't get offended
I'm in another state of mind right now
I miss my motherfuckin' uncle
