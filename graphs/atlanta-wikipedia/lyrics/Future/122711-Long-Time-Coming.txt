Ey, it's been a long time coming, babe
Oh, I just called to see how you been doin' late
You wouldn't understand the person that I grown into
We both moved on, I bet you still reminiscing
I hurt you so bad, I just need for you to listen
We was friends before all of this
I was taking out the limo thinking
How much you was there for me,
