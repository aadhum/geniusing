Waking up fresh, that's Kodak
Killing these niggas, you know that
Real street nigga, you know that
Real street nigga, you know that
I think 56 nights crazy
I think 56 nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I took 56 bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand man shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation
Money keep a nigga motivated
Molly keep a nigga motivated
Percocet keep em motivated
Good drank keep a nigga motivated
Lortabs on my conversation
Talk a lot of bands then we conversatin'
I was on my way to Rice Street in the paddie wagon and it had me numb
The pain from the slum had me numb
Got the passport in Saudi Arabia
We ain't nothing but some Talibans
I've just been hanging with savages
Lately I've been hanging around with my savages
I think 56 nights crazy
I think 56 nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I took 56 bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand man shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation
Promethazine took my concentration
To another level then I
Chop it up with a sack chaser
Money touch a niggas hands, on a few Xans might won't count it
Hit the trap in my Louboutins
Count it up then I bag up a brick
These bitches louder than a motherfucker
I think 56 nights crazy
I think 56 nights crazy
I think me and Esco crazy
I think me and Young Sco' crazy
I took 56 bars all in one month nigga and I'm still dranking
I could still see the scar on a nigga hand man shit real crazy
I been taking these molly's, still nodding off cause a nigga too faded
I've been laying low key inside a nigga vault, money is my motivation
