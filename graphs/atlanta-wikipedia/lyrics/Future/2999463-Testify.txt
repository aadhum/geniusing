So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall and get mad high?
Anything we go through is a test of times
Can you be the one who love me all the time?
We not doing good, you can see the signs
Can you do the crime like it's Bonnie and Clyde?
Show me everything I need to see on my blind side
Connoisseurs of purp
mad high
I'm in to win
So you wanna fall for the bad guy?
So you wanna fall and get mad high?
