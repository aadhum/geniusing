I gave you love like a guru
I ride the B with the wings
Put a few of them B's in the ring
Sippin' purp, I don't fuck with the red
She know I ride with the toaster
Get worshipped like Moses
Heavenly sent from the crew are my niggas
I'm liftin' my niggas, I love the young niggas
I put them bezels in Jesus face
Got this yellow bitch look just like Lisa Ray
Hatin' on me and I go and fuck Lisa Ray
You niggas always wanna imitate
Take your bitches out on dinner dates
I get some head on the interstate, ay
