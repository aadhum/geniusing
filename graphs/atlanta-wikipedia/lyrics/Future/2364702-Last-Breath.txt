My grandma didn't even believe in me
Jewelry at the bank now in the vault
You should've never doubted me
I'ma work 'til my last breath
I'ma hustle 'til my last breath
Yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Yeah you should've never doubted me
The pain and the struggle followed me
My daddy never been there, bothered me
And these cold streets made a man of me
Know a time, it'll come, they doubt me
Had to keep them OGs 'round me
Keep a young, young homie grounded
You never know where your motivation'll come from
pop Chandon
They try to push you aside, you gotta fight some
I had it on the dot
icon
I got that beast in my eyes, I'm like Tyson
With my heart and my drive, I know I'm righteous
Keep some ice on me, Rocky, Rocky like Balboa
I got ol' girl, then I transport her
Trappin' is a habit, I got Xans on me
Catch me whippin', I'm Hussein with them bands on me
You neglected me, you know you shouldn't have did that
They was countin' me out, you know you shouldn't have did that
I just wanna be the champ for the misfits
And the ones that would say I couldn't do it
whole 'nother rebel
Obama on my main line, I could run the nation
