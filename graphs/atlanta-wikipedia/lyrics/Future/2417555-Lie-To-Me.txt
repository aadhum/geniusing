I see you Spin, this right here the truth
racks
under them briefs
Tell that lil nigga to stay in his place before I expose you
You take one shot at me, you know that'll cause an explosion
Never fight the hand that feeds you, nigga
I'm a mothafuckin' boss (I’m a mothafuckin’ boss)
I'm a mothafuckin' boss, I’m a mothafuckin’ boss
I'm a mothafuckin' giant
I know Tiarra, and Britney, and Keisha
I had to live with this crown on my head
I don’t got no regrets, I don’t have no regrets
I got to live with this crown on my head
I got to talk to my homies up stairs
