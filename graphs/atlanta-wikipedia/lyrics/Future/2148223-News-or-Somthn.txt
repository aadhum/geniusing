Old school Chevy '55 granddaddy
Gotta throw some salt on it, cause you know I'm getting at it
Throw the fork on it, then put it in traffic
Throw the sauce on it, got it flying out of Dallas
Hope you didn't throw away what we established
Hope you wouldn't turn your back on your family
Hold on to that clip like a doped up needle
Nothing but a bad little bitch in some red bottoms
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
It's a full moon in the middle of the day
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Tell them young niggas grind
'fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
Hoes getting X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
Had the Parkay jumping out the Pyrex
High definition glass on my pinky finger
The bird on the bezel, I’m a well known rebel
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
Told a young nigga Freeband, Roc-A-Fella
We work the frontstreet where mama said: "Don't go"
Shawty don't fuck with these folks, these
Niggas be telling these days, be telling these days
Gold Rolex, better check your peripheral
Got the trap jammed packed like The Masquerade
Know a few real ones ain’t gon’ see they next birthday
Tell them young niggas grind
'fore you gon' knock someone down
If they gon' shoot, then shoot something
We better hear 'bout this shit on the news or something
Young came through holding on the cane like a drummer
Hoes getting X'd out and we on ganja
The police wanna talk, but we won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
True to these clips, niggas won't say nothing
