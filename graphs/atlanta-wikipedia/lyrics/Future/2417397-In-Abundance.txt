Young, wild, and reckless
At least I ain't checkless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Let 'em hear them loud pipes
Let the banger go
I was in Givenchy cruisin' in a Humvee
Most these guys be frontin', there's no way I'm respondin'
Took her out for a luncheon, I put it all in her stomach
Sippin' outta my cup and it's spillin' all on my money
First I had bought a Beamer then I had bought a Benz
Some'll get joined in, most of us born in
Open the door for me, I'm already goin' in
She knew my drive, she knew how much I want it
See how I tried to give you numerous warnings
You wanna talk down on a nigga who born to win
I give another chance to turn to a perfect man
I do this shit again, if I can be where I'm at today
Ben Franklin's comin', it comin' in abundance
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Rep the gang till I'm breathless
Let 'em hear the exhaust, show 'em you a boss
Peep how the Christian Louboutins look when I walk
Gotta live this high life when you in this wild life
Gotta keep the draco
Bust a nigga; Tadoe
Runnin' up my pesos
Upper echelon, you my motherfuckin' student
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd
Niggas I'm a don, fuck around hit the stewardess
Percocets and Zans got my head in the clouds
Gucci with the Bape, I done started a style
Full grown ape, nigga sprayin' the crowd
