You can't tell me you got no love for me, no
You can't tell me you ain't got no love for me, no
I got a wolf standin' by my side
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
sweat running
We tryna have a good time
We toastin' it up at the juke joint
Sit by the bar at the juke joint
Made love in the car at the juke joint
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
One hell of a night, it's a portrait
The JW Marriott in Dubai, it influenced this
Take a few laps on the horses before the sun sets
Three different highs, I'm off the ground
