Freeband Gang
Some of this astronaut shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I was cookin' up an ounce until it dry-dry
I be stackin' up this paper til it dry right
I can tell she had a toe, she gave me side eye
Told that bitch to wait no time to give me five-five
When they give it up this quick, nigga why try?
Got a girl and made her switch, call 'em bi-bi
2000 for some trousers, when I'm fly, I'm fly
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I just fled from the scene in a wide body
took
Balmains, depends which ones, they cost a whole thousand
Really think that she the one? Don't bring that ho around me
When you see her out in public, she so shy-shy
When you get her in the bed, she bring that freak out
She gave me real nasty mouth, Lady Gaga
She got a real nasty mouth, I won't apologize
She like hoes and I like hoes, I hit the bull's eye
I got a rockin' presidential, that ain't no lie
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 60 on her watch, she call me dada
I might fuck her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
Balmains on my jock, you heard me, yeah-yeah
I spent 80 on her watch, she call me dada
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
I might smash her on the couch and tell her bye-bye
