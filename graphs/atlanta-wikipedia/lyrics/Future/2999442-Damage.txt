Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
I've been there, I've been there for you
Girl, you know that it's true
Aw yeah, out here getting it baby
Never ever let the money stop
Dirty police trying to fuck it up
If money come, he wanna pull you over
New check, fuck my life up
Anytime I'm in a new city
I prefer to do light drugs
Police try to hit the tour bus
Try and fuck a nigga life up
You can fuck a nigga life up
By trying to fuck a nigga wife once
Money fucked a nigga life up
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
You know it's true, you know it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
I've been there, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true
Swipe my credit card, fuck my life up
I ain't had sex in a whole week
Just so you can get to know me
My role model fucked my life up
Girl, I've been there for you
Money coming, money coming so fast
And you know that it's true
Girls it's true
Girl, I've been there for you
And you know that it's true
