My mama said "fuck it, nigga, hit the streets and live"
Got some crack in the corner and I did what I did
The neighbors they don't like me, I got J's at the door
Told my grandma I don't need a bed, I'm sleeping on the floor
Got my tool and my blow, them my two main hoes
Me and all my woes stick together like the Zoes
Sak Pase, who got the yay for the lows?
And I keep birds with me like I'm straight out Hollygrove
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
I'm a dog, and I eat that dog food
I'm a G, I put red on all my shoes
Come and see my la familia got peru
And I plead not guilty until proved
Got more birds than the zoo
Got chickens in the coup
Got shottas that'll shoot
And I stay on DJ Screw
When you drop it, it coming back like DJ Clue
Ima A1 nigga can't lose
Free Band Gang put you on the news
Blue Flames
Put 20 in my tru's
thats 20,000 fool
I put a play together, like Peyton Manning do
I'm rapping dope to you
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
My fingers, they itchin', they itchin' for that paper
I'm riding round the city and I got my calculator
I'm a mothafuckin' monster wen it come to getting that paper (aye)
