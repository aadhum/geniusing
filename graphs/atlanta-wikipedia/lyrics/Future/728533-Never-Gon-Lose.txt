This bitch from Australian and I'm an alien
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again
I took your bitch to Aruba
When I say super that's
young Super Future
Never gone lose cause these bitches gone choose
These bitches gone be who they is
Walking and talking like classy
You a ho to your heart, you a ho to your heart
You know I'll be working that boy I'm a poet
Hop in the Spur, then might hop in the Porsche
Me and my niggas so mothafucking tight
You can't even tell us apart
Fuck a bitch every single damn night
Ain't nothing but avatar
Get to poppin' them Percocets and Xanax like they some Tylenol
I'm on loudest green, we gotta have some green
She gone thug for me, she gone thug for me
In O-hi-o that's my shorty
You see they try sabotage me and then copy
They wasn't playing fair no no, oh no no, oh no no
Bitch is a bozo, she clown in the photos
We sell the coco you talking to popo
You know that's a no no, you know that's a no no
You know that's a no no no no no no no no
Panty droppers had no panties on
Went bought a G-Wagon
Mayweather, Pacquiao, nigga, we still at it
Get up and get at it, guns like I'm Bin Laden
I sip out a cup of this shit, it's so muddy
But I love it baby
I said I wasn't gonna fuck with that bitch then I fucked her again
I took your bitch to Aruba
When I say super that's young Super Future
