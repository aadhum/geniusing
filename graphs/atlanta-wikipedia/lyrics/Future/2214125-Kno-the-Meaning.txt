My uncle Ronnie used to wash cars
My uncle Wayne was a kingpin, you know what I'm saying
My uncle Don, that nigga used to rob banks and shit, rest in peace
My granddaddy was a boss, he was a king pin you hear me
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning
Dropped Monster tape and had to go to Europe
Best thing I ever did was fall out of love
Esco came to me, he said they think you washed up
You need to go back in, show these niggas who the one
We going back in as soon as we get off tour
He had my hard drive on him when he caught the case
When they took him in custody they took my life away
People didn't even understand that my hard drives that I recorded all my music on for two years straight was on this... was on this one hard drive that Esco had and he was locked up with it so I had to record new music.
That's when I did Beast Mode
Zaytiggy's
ain't got Esco with me
Ain't got nobody smoke one or pour with me
And I'm still dealing with the time they gave Doe B
How he gon' catch an armed robbery around me?
Brown paper bag we getting back to the paper
Everything I did, it was premeditated
I just knew there'd come a time when I finally did make it
And some niggas started hating, I ain't never had no problem with these niggas
I've been about my guala from the dodo
Got an R&B chick laying on me, no photo
Got a combo in the condo doing some real life porno
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning
I ain't holding this back, I ain't holding this
The music way ahead of its time and I notice this
My hard work finally catching up with perfect timing
Got the game from them old niggas
You gotta know where I'm from to get to know a nigga
Do a little time out the country, I need this
56 nights, gotta know the real meaning
