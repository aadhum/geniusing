Pluto!
808 Mafia
This bad Ethiopian gave me Becky (I swear to god)
This blonde ghetto broad gave me Becky
And my Venezuelan, gave me Becky
I told you from the jump its one thou
Bloody Goyard that's a checky
Buy the block and I'ma die to pay the mortgage  (woah)
Dead broke, you still alive, it's rigamortis (woah)
I got the choppers so don't make me get deported (woah)
My condolences, I heard about your losses
Killing these niggas, Ricky Ross about to floss it
I got her pussy popping on my triple beam
Black bottles or you know we sipping lean
Drinking the yellow or the red, I want the green
On leather seats, and I'm on Promethazine
Hundred room mansion, now I think I'm Scarface (boss)
Pull a chopper, put a few Dracos in them spots
