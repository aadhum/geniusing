I told Mike, you know what I'm sayin'
I took the bitch out of Steve, bitch out of Steve
I took the bitch out of Steve
I took them hoes outta Soho, then I put them in Manolo
I went from two door to four door
Went from a two door to four door
From four door to two door
I'm back in the coupe
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch fuck another bitch
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch eat another bitch
Bitches ain't worth shit to me
The kush is worth more than you
We know the Drake from the Mike
I went from Mike to Young Metro
I go from Metro to Mike and I'm back with Young Will
Told em we back goin' ape, nigga we smokin' so great
Nigga went straight from the A, now we back out in LA
Nigga went straight to the hills, we just got time to build
A M on a M, that's a film
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch fuck another bitch
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch eat another bitch
I got a AR the Chopper
A chopper the FN, the 40
The 40 the eagle and a 30
The .38 bust you so ugly
They chargin' a sixty to walk
I'm chargin' em 70 to talk
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch fuck another bitch
Ask me how it feel to watch your bitch eat another bitch
I turn up all of these bitches
I could buy all of you bitches
I can buy all of you bitches
I made it you bitch
