Yeah, I lost so many niggas to the streets this year
I ain't even talkin' about, they ain't even dead
They ain't, they ain't dead
Feds did a sweep, Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up
Got a few of my niggas in the sweeps
Trill niggas linkin' up
Real niggas linkin' up
Shit ain't gonna be the same, man
Feds did a sweep
Free my niggas
Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up
Trill niggas linkin' up
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I don't fantasize, I make movies
I don't tell lies, I tote Uzi's
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
Give your life for this gang gang shit
Put a dollar sign on my enemies
You can't come between my embassy
You gotta stay off the premises
I was down and out, and I remember this
It's gon' hurt my soul just to reminisce
Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up
Trill niggas linkin' up
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
Knocks
Police! We have a search warrant
Police! Police search warrant!
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground, get on the ground!
Get down on the ground!
Gunshots
The Feds did a sweep
The homie tried to plead insanity
Feds did a sweep
Real niggas linkin' up
Trill niggas linkin' up
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
I done start buyin' more Cubans
These links on me leavin' bruises
I get idolized by these groupies
I treat 'em just like they're regular, yeah
They sneakin' pics on the cellular
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Preyin' on me, I'm the predator
Them bands on me, more capital
Real niggas linkin' up
Trill niggas linkin' up
Feds did a sweep
Link up, my nigga, let's link up
