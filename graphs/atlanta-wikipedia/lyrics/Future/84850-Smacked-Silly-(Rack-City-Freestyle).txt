I told you, I'm the illest with this mic shit
Spit it off the top, I'ont even gotta write shit
You dumb guys, I do rap and soccer shit
You don't see me glow? I'm bout to blow like a rocket ship
Rest in peace to em but I'm bout to smoke a Big L
You should hand over the mic like Taylor Swift did
Hit it and a nigga spit fire like I'm Spy-ro
I'm runnin' in your crib like I'm Kramer off of Seinfeld
You sleepin' boo? I slide thru, like PeekaBoo
You frozen in shock now ya nickname is Pikachu
My punchlines'll punch lines in ya whole damn face
Fake niggas gimme dap, I leave em hanging no noose
I'mma boss, I could never take an off day
Cause I'mma be a star who got bucks, no latte s
I'm good lookin', rhyme tight, and I flow nuts
Krispy Kreme workers even sayin' that my dough nuts
