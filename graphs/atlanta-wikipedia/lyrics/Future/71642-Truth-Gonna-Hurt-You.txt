Future Hendrix
My experience
It’s a cold-cold-cold world baby
Put on your coat
I didn't wanna lie to you
But it sound more fly to you
I didn't wanna lie to you
I swear it sound way fly to you
Cause the truth is gonna hurt you
The truth’s gonna hurt you
I swear the truth’s gonna hurt you
Truth gon' hurt you
I live a cowabunga lifestyle
All these girls around me go wild
And I’m so caught up in my own style
I can’t see you niggas in the crowd
I’m so far, ain’t gonna never come down
You can ask around, I run the town
I’m Future Hendrix and I run Pluto
Since we first got together things changed for the better
I'm on a the first class flight
Ain't pack a bag overnight
Cause I'mma shop when I land
Yeah, I'mma shop when I land
When you playin’ with them bandz
5 Suite hotel, that's all where we staying
Feel like sinkin I'm in sand
Some things you wouldn’t understand
I got a trio, tryna suck me up like Tito
