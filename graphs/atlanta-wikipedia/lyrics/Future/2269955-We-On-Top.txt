Niggas ain't aiming at your chest, shooters aim straight for the top
I don't even wanna fuck these hoes no more man all I want is the top
Even in the winter time we cop these drops and drops in the top
Came from the projects and got on the grind shot straight to the top
We on top, we on top, we on top
We on top, we on top
They sleepin' on the seventh floor, thinking no no
They got 28 floors, we on the 28th floor
We on top
Lil Mexico the army, Freeband the marine
Two cup, filled up, drankin' on Aid
