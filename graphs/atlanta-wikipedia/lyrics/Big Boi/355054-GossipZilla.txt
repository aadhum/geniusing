[Intro:]
Godzilla!
We on fire fire fire fire
Yea! We on fire fire fire fire
Yea! We on fire fire fire fire
Yea! We on fire fire fire fire
Yea! We on fire fire fire fire
Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip
Niggas wanna tell it, hoes hoes wanna gossip
Niggas wanna tell it, hoes wanna gossip
We on
[Verse 1: Big Boi]
Fire vocals because my voice was a classic
Like Coca Cola when they had cocaine in the package
I meant to say blowing the ingredients
But I went to the mall today and all the niggas had those mediums
Little bitty ass clothes
Oh and niggas don’t dance no mo
All they do is this
Beef it up
Fat sacks nigga
I’m from Atlanta bitch, we never shop with strangers
No matter, we strain the slanging
Niggas is outchea talking like a cockatoo to a cop or two
Now they watchin' you and yo mama too, bird’s eye view
[Bridge: Blue Oyster Cult]
With a purposeful grimace and a terrible sound
He pulls the spitting high tension wires down
Godzilla!
[Verse 2: Pimp C]
I’m getting blowed on the regular
Riding and talking dirty on my cellular
Player I got some real good that will save you some
Uh and if you my homeboy she gon give you some
And it’s all for the paper but she still gon come
You dippin' in the cookie jar, now you sprung
hoes wanna gossip
Cus they pussy wasn’t hittin and they lip was super sloppy
Sucka duck a motherfucker,
body truckin' cus the money I already made
Man I hate that all the time I got haters in my bizz
Talking bout the trill but don’t know what the fuck it is
Mothafuckas nowadays are seriously sorry
Bitch you could get the middle, (what middle?), the finger
Stick it in yo ass and let it linger
