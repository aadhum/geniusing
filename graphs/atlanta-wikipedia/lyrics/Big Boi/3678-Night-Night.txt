The rhymes I design, are truly unrefined
Like diamonds with a speck of blood, dug up out the mine
Flows flood between the ears, right behind my eyes
I takes my time when deciding what to write
Like the SAT, while these other niggas bite
Underrated and mostly hated but got a lot fight
Like a player, play the background, fuck the spotlight
Night, night I recite when I step up to this mic
When your ass cross paths, with this half of the 'Kast
Check my record you will see that I'm verified
(Nobody want none, nathan, this none)
[Interlude: Big Boi]
Yeah, this where the second verse supposed to go
I don't even think I need to hit y'all with another verse
But I, I think I just might
Because I, like to destroy shit
There's no retreat, and no surrender
Been ready for battle, General Patton's no beginner
I keep it all Madden, I call the play then execute for the W
Snow, that's for toboggans, no, won't be no pardons
You're snitching on yourself, and now your front door they come through
Without a tap on your phone
The only thing they had to do, was listen to the raps in your songs
Clap x6
Lights out, the time for nighty nights long overdue
here, here comes something new
Any kind of Cadillac I go slow
When I'm smokin' on some of that choco, no low, no mid
Top of the line pine, because I blow big
