[Intro: George Clinton]
This is that dope-on-dope, smoke but don't choke on
It's the shit, plenty blunt junkies have been known to croak
From less than a toke cause it's da bomb
For those who think life is unfair
Cause I blow my smoke in the air
As if no one is standin there
Then I'll roll one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows
In my chair, as I sit back smiling from ear to ear
With a fistful of your girlfriend's hair
Yes, she'll blow one tonight, fo' yo' sorrows
Daddy Fat Sax
back on the scene
Went and shot two or three movies
But everything's straight like 9:15
It's back to the time machine, I believe
Back to the rhymin, back to the spit
Back to the high hats kick snare
Y'all niggas dare to think that was it, we everywhere (Biatch!)
Like the air you breathe
Got 'em stuck like Chuck in the web we weave
Best believe I'll change your steeze, take the lead
Change the speed, slow it down just for the sport
Nigga, one of my favorite rappers happens to be Too $hort
Now everybody wanna sell dope (sell dope)
Got a P, got a pound, got some hope (nope)
Jesse Jackson had a lil' bit of hope, for the folks
On the rope, back in 1984 (84')
Biatch!
I say "stank you very much" cause we appreciate the hate
Now go get yourself a handgun, you fucking with a great
Put it your mouth and squeeze it like your morning toothpaste {*gunshot*}
Kill yo'self, like Sean Kingston, suicidal for a title
My recitals are vital and may be needed for survival
Like the Bible or any other good book that you read
Why are 75% of our youth reading magazines?
Cause they used to a fantasy, and that's what they do to dream
Call it fiction addiction cause the truth is a heavy thing
Remember when the levees screamed, made the folks evacuees
Yeah, I'm still speakin about it cause New Orleans ain't clean
When we shouting "Dirty South", I don't think that is what we mean
I mean, it mean the rough, the tough, the dangerous, we reign supreme
Can slaughter entire teams with the ink that my pen bleeds
B-I-G, B-O-I, nigga please
Don't want no girlfriend
Just need my dope (I just need my dope)
Take another huff and puff
And choke and toke on icky, stinky, sticky
Stuff a bowl and pack a pipe, twist a blunt, roll and light a joint
Cause this is the dope on dope
Some good shit, yeah
Lean back and puff slow
