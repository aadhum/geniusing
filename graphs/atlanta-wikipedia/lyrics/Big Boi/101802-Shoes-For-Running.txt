[Hook: Wavves]
What about the people that's barefoot
With no shoes for running when the sun come up?
Hey one percenters, the 99 say what you gonna do for us?
We'll run up in your house like the first runner up
Be the first one to buck and the last one to get laid down
Revolt, but y'all niggas here too soft
Bubblegum, just popping off
At the mouth like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dough and all the women
Boy, what you gon' do in the penitentiary
Got a lot of money, can't take it with me
I can't take it with me,
I wish they could send me
To the moon and back with a cure for cancer
And save the lives of my great grandmama and my great grandaddy
But they make money of the medicine
Leaving us all stuck in elections
With no progressions, just recessions
Just as I expected, life gets deadly
It's funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent or the direction that you stretch it
So my niggas will draw when shit gets sketchy
That's a masterpiece, a work of art
A gallery, not photoshop
Pictures say a million words, so I just let my photos talk
Even in your local talk, niggas say you know he boss
Everytime my name is brought up better know it's mogul talk
That's why she give me geek 'till her shins weak
I'm blazing everyday, you can call that demp week
That's like playing hide and seek with the Grim Reaper
Different nights, same town
Say goodbyes, but we tried
Cause we know there's no getting out
And when the pawns are playing themselves
Let them war out till they wear themselves out to the rhythm sells out
