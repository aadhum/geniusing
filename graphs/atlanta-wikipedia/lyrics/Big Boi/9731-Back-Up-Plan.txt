Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan
A-Town
I knew I was wrong, for thinking that she cared
I knew all along, that's why I stay prepared
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
My nigga what was I to do, but find somebody else
(Boo, I got a back up plan to the back up plan
To back up my back up plan)
This is how it all starts
Momma fell heels over head and says you was the one
Big Boi, but she calls me Antwan
So just for fun, I went along with hon
I was young, full of cum, down for the skeet skeet, not dumb
She in heat like beitch on a leash
No disrespect, but metaphorically she's a beast
No teasing, no whining
Just bumping and grinding till we got slimey
Yeah, from that sweet stick thang, can't complain
I was hooked on that box like the hot Krispy Cremes
Well it didn't even take long for me to game peep
It was week after week, I was seeing the same freak
I be damned if we posing for pictures and throwing rice
Maybe throwing up in Vegas while Daddy is on the dice
I might (might) just put you on the chopping block tonight
Act right and you can get my second string spotlight
But if you freaking, I'm speaking clean as a whistle
This'll be the last offical offer before dismissal
Yeah, got the latex gloves for the fit
Because she trying to trick Daddy, Slip-N-Slide on this dick!
You are not the one, you are not the one
You can be my two, you can be my two
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
(And one and two, now you know what to do)
And one and one, everybody have fun
And one and one, everybody have fun
Now two, now two, I'mma give her back to you
I'm through, nigga
I done had enough of the nasty stuff
One, two...yeah!
