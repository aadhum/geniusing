Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around
Niggas don't fuck with a nigga like me
Cause a nigga like me don't fuck around, around
I know you see that
No one's competin
Ooh and that turns me on
Ooh, that turns me on
What turns me on about ya? I doubt you have a clue
Sassy attitude and red bottom shoes got 'em mad at you
With the features of an angel and the bottom of a horse
Thoroughbred, thorough head makes you moist
Like the dark fudge brownie with the nut of your choice
Soakin wet are the feathers in the goose down
Who's loose now?
Callin out my name when I'm askin "Whose is this?"
Nah, it's not a game, ass fallin out the frame
With my Polaroid camera I have to take two flicks
She can't avoid all this stamina, we do this
With no steroids or other artificial juices
We can break boards and you can kick rocks or I'm through
