No introductions needed boy just call me the undefeated
And underneath this Georgia drawl, I know I can't be seen with
Bifocals because my vocals are classic
Like Coca Cola when they had cocaine in the package
I meant to say blow in the ingredients
I went to the mall today and all the niggas had on smediums
Little bitty ass clothes
Like Dancing with the Stars without the judges or the dance flo'
Oh and niggas don't dance no more, all they do is this
Beef it up, call me venus fly trap, waiting on fly emcees to eat em up
cataract prescription filler
I got my medicinal card from Los Angeles, the city of lost angels
A connoisseur of cannabis and from Atlanta bitch
We never shop with strangers, no matter what strain they slanging
Niggas is out here talking like a cockatoo to a cop or two
Now they watching you and your Mama too, bird's eye view, view
[Verse 2: Pimp C]
Uh I'm getting blowed on the regular
Riding and talking dirty on my cellular
Playa, I got some young girls that'll sell you some
And if you my homeboy, she gon' give you some
And it's all for the paper but she still gon' cum
You dipping in the cookie jar and now you're sprung, uh
Cause they pussy wasn't hitting and they lip was super sloppy
Suck a, duck a mothafucka, rims chop, Lorena Bobbit
Want my money corner pocket
plenty game ho
Sop it like a biscuit,
Got it popping like a skillet with some chicken grease in it
Country boy, I'm country raised,
from the belly to the grave
Word to pimp
Man, I hate it all the time, I got haters in my biz
Talking bout the trill but don't know what the fuck it is
Mothafuckas nowadays are seriously sorry
Thinking that the key to life is putting your business on Maury
You say you rocking Mauri but that motherfucker Rockport
I know the truth so ain't no need in your lying
Bullshit ain't working, ain't no need in your trying
Dying to be the nigga that's spied in the telescope
Save it for Jeremy Kyle
what middle, the finger
Stick it in your ass and let it linger
No homo and hit the high note like and R&B singer on promo
