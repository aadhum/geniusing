Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Free falling, Thom Pettie
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Thom Pettie that ho
Freefalling, we up all night
I rock one chain for medallion
With a whole lot of motherfucking diamonds
It’s astounding like when I be rhyming
Always shining like the sun and moon
Like a hot air balloon requires fire
No methamphetamine, but nigga we get higher
Big Boi, dopamine, I mean I’m dope
Been a serial killer, oh nice to meet you, best believe that
Like Ripley’s boy, don’t tempt me
I fuck around and leave your Kool-Aid glass half empty
That’s right, it as in IT
We like the apple on your iPhone, niggas always biting
[Bridge: Little Dragon]
[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Motel, hotel
Intercontinental
all cause a nigga push a pencil
That’s an S550, not a rental
Bitch, I don’t even ride Lincoln Continentals
In the rear seat is a fat black nigga with a smile like Denzel
Pretty model bitch with me moving bout as graceful as a gazelle
Skinny as a pencil, fold her like a pretzel
Hit her with the XL
Just in case this funky-ass bitch was doing intel
I'm-a give her news she can go tell
Snitchin'-ass bitches get evicted, no bus fare
I’m so player, SpottieOttieDopaliscious
Mama phony but I swear to God the pussy dope and she delicious
