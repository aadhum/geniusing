Been patient, we both played our part in heart-breakin
Most time you hurt, more than I, face it
Took blows to the heart, that's family
My mother, been 20 years with a hustler
He always taught, never talk slick
A woman's place submit to a boss, couldn't take it
So many nights seein momma on the couch stressin
She lookin at the clock, it's quarter past 2
Next day, and still no sign of daddy
A hustler, always loyal to the customer
In love with the only example of family
Waitin for the day to come
Like waitin on the mailman first of the month
Make her more wetter when a nigga bust
Dude I keep her soakin wet to the touch (I do)
No joke, can't stop 'til she get enough
Like a paper towel, quick to pick her up
I ain't fin' to front
From the jump or the giddy up bruh
It's plenty pretty bitties in the city I'm from
And I'm gon' get me just one
To ride shotgun, do you hear me? Just one, one
My blood pumps red, but give me a purple heart
Instead cause a nigga goes hard
Kinda like a egg, boilin in a pot of hot water (hot water)
Or like a Fed with a no-knock warrant
Chevy
