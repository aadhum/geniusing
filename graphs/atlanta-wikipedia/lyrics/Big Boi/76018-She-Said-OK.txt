Lemme see ya titties
Lemme see ya titties
She said okay
Okay
Now, lemme see ya pussy
Lemme see ya pussy
She said okay
Okay
[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
We at the freaknik affair, throw your money in the air
Let it rain, rain, let it rain down
She wanna skip the winter just to shake it in the summer
If I didn't show to your party homie that's a bummer
Strippers on the pole and they going up and down
I'm a fly Brooklyn, bitch
But when I'm in Atlanta I be sticking ones in her thong
I'ma play that cat like it was played by Santana
Touching on your nipples mighty long take a seat girl
Wanna introduce you to my mighty long
When we hit the stage tell them mark niggas you feeling me
Atlanta, Georgia,
they say all the hoes at Magic
See no I'm no David Copperfield but I'm sure I can pull a rabbit
See I'm adamant when I see something I want, I reach out and grab it
Like this cannabis that I'm blowing bust the package boy its cherry kush
Uh stank ya smelly much
But this is the only hairy bush I would like to put my lips on
I like that pussy Brazilian waxed with the lips showin'
How many licks does it take to get to the bottom of tootsie roll (yup)
Pop goes the weasel when I explode in her mouth
boy that's cold
-er than Shaquille O'Neal from the free throw line
And I'm a peaceful person so she wanted to give me piece of mind
Now it appears that I am brain dead
My legs feel like Joe from Family Guy because she got insane head
Call me crazy but nowadays it seems like nothing is sacred
Oh well, I already got me somebody to play with
Could you please let me see, let me see
