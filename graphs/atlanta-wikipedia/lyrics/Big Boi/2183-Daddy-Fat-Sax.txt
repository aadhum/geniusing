It is I, the B-I-G, the B-O-I
Me oh my, ears to the street and eyes to the sky
I got bigger fish to fry
niggas wish I would retire
Cause of the pressure I apply every time I bust a rhyme
None of the rest of ya are tryin, watch me stimulate the minds of the masses
While you niggas kickin it like jackasses
And who you votin for, Republican or Democratic?
Don't say it doesn't matter cause that's how they stole the last one
Assassin's bullet might be waitin for Obama
Do you think they'll have a brother before Billy's baby mama? C'mon!
Look at the way you look at me"
Da-Daddy Fat Sax
In my Cadillac, six woofers and fo' amps
My daddy told me it was mine for the takin
A true gift from God, the stars aligned when they made me
Him and Rena's baby, their first born son
I'm Antwan Andr√© Patton, the only one
Bloodline of a champion with heart of the lion
I'm defyin all the laws like a caterpillar flying
Way before my time
and reside in the Dirty Dirty
Where they still hangin nooses like we in the early '30s
Royal fam of Atlanta, Dungeon bitch you understand?
I write knockout songs, you spit punchlines for money
I'm on another planet my nigga and you just fly
Take that motherfucker, take that!
Ridin off in the Cadillac like that nigga
