Jag k√§nner att jag faller
[Hook: Little Dragon]
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
If ya don't know me by now
You will never know
If ya don't, if ya don't
Grandmamas, great grandmama they gone
My daddy's gone
the city I was born and raised
By now you should know us
Got damn it, my daddy is gone
(From the waves that rock I listen for you
