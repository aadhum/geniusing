You see, baby had back, I ain't really into skinny chicks
And she tastes like raspberries, damn, I want you to know
And if you see how she work the stroll
That body was out of control
Ain't no way I was about to let her go
I ran my game like I was supposed
If her boyfriend trying to trip talking shit, I'mma beat his ass
You should let her go, it ain't worth the problems, hell no
