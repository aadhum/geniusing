Gimme one reason why
Gimme one reason why
Why, you're the apple of my eye
In the beginning they say Eve bit it
They're still sinning
Cause they letting every Tom Dick and Steve hit it
Like the weed with the seeds in it
Make your stock go up, my Apple stock split
Took a gamble caught it at forty and now it's over six
I'm rich trick and that's in hundos
So overseas you might catch us eating Nando's
Some say the preacher's daughters are some of the freakiest ones
They been deprived of fun and now they just wanna cut loose
Like everybody else they wilding try to find theyself
And by the time they do they barely have nobody left over
Feeling empty and alone, cause the youth is gone
The thrill has been killed so let the truth be told
Of your sweet red delicious love
You're the apple of my eye
