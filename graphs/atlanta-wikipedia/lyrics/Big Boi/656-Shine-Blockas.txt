Yeah! All the ladies say hoooo
All the hoes say (Hah! Hah! Hah!)
A-town, C-port
Cutmaster Swift down your throat, shawty
Boy stop, Sir Luscious Left Foot's on fire
I came equipped like a prophylactic,
now they riding dicks
Now they rich, try convince everybody to trick off
But a true boss done paid the cost
she giving away them drawers
Word to the brown James, he some chicken chow mein
Really mane, you done say some silly things
And the fella Dana Dane, boy you cuffed, claimed a dame
Hey my main thang got my last name, know what I mean?
I can't close my safe no more cause I got too much money in it
They put Gucci in a cell then Madea went to jail
I make music, I make movies, I need Tyler Perry sales
Loud smell coming out the Lamb', fuck it what the hell
Gucci Mane, so I'm Guccied down, she got on Chanel
Zone 6, East Atlanta's own
fuck with Nia Long
When I stop, everybody watch, car don't have a top
The piggy bank got legs and feet and can get up and walk away, shawty
Pistol grip in my lap at all times
'lac
From Atlanta to Savannah
Not when God's got his hands on me only the strong survive
