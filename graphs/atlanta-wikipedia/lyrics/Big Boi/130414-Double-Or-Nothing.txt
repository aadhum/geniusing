They say the good die young
I guess I’ll be here forever
A step away from the edge
And the edge is closer than ever
Skeletons in my closet
I’ll never live to regret them
So if you looking for mercy
You came in the wrong direction
I came from a different league
Bred from a different breed
No surrender, never retreat
Just like a table full of spades players
We taking out the joker – ers
Got explosives and their big ole bag of guns
‘Cause it’s faster and more furious when I'm done, run!
Got triggers on the clock
Bitch it’s hammer time
We brothers don’t take no shit
Like septic tanks and toilet seat covers
