A-town
Cutmaster Swift, down your throat
Leather seats all wet, paint up on the Fleetwood
Jordans on my toes, did my feet good
Still got my Coogi, my shorty got a Gucci on
Rolled up, rolls cut, drop with the doors up
Now it's stacks that I stack for the sixteen bars
Dipping through the hood plucking chicks, but I don't kiss em
She wishin that I would take her home; long stick her
Then I get her back, hit it from the back and I'm gone
[Verse Three: Big Boi]
With my southern drawl, awkwardly I spray
Like the backside of a skunk and the stash house with the pump
Pistol whip in my lap at all times in the 'Llac
East Point, College Park
Decatur,
