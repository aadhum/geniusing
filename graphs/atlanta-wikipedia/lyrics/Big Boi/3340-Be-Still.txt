When was the last time you went t-bagging?
Must be tea time
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be still young heart
Never will you fall apart
Be wise my dear you must, learn to just be still
Until you really really know
Show me you're right, shine your light
I wonder when will I know
Like a mannequin in the window I don't say
A, word - I like to sit back, observe
My heart says do not disturb
and yours
Is like a doorknob, everybody get a turn (yeah)
Now that's a turnoff, girl, I'm not concerned
More like the early bird tryin to get the worm worm
But not on those terms, you got on my nerves
Say I don't deserve you, you're gonna learn
Treat it like a perm, leave it be or let it burn (burn)
Eat 'em like an urr-ange, orange
So when they on the verge of leavin it don't get borin
Foreign trips are taken just to see your smiley faces
Time's a-wastin and I don't like to waste no time
You can be down or.. yeah
[Verse 2: Janelle Monae]
I love being in love
Then you let me down, turned my heart around
Givin up on love, makes my ocean drown
You lived in my heart
Secret melodies haunt me at night
Maybe lies and lullabies
This is my last farewell
You let me down
Yeah, from behind the Cadillac do'
Grip this wood, slide around real slow
Just thinkin, mind blown
As I glare through the smoke tinted windows
And be still
