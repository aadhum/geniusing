Boy stop, you ain't no DJ
I double dare, matter of fact nigga, I double dog dare
Any rapper to take it there with this player here
Let's be clear, I'm a leader, not your peer
Valedictorian of this rap shit every year
Like beer and pretzels with the game I go good
I'm the Hansel to your Gretel
You'se a dame, understood
Overstand ho ass nigga from my hood
I'm embarrassed by the lack of class
Sat in the back of class
But passed with flying colors with yo backwards ass
You're like the caboose
And I'm the engine locomotive to let loose steam in the booth
Dream Team,
nigga fuck that pillow talk, keep sleeping
While beating down yo street up in that green thing
Greetings, Earthlings I've been lurking deep in the shadows
Gathering artillery for the battle
Now on the front line I stand
Microphone in my right hand, left foot on the gas
Don't make me put my foot in yo ass
[Hook: Big Boi]
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just make them fucking mixtapes
Where they at?
Yo DJ ain't no DJ, he just hit that instant replay
There they go
My momma gave birth to a 10-pound, 6-ounce dream
And God said look for the burning bush
Now I turned to weed
So I jumped in my shell when I saw my momma burning trees
Hard white, I trickle nickel bags
Ice cold true shit, in the booth with blue lips
On your grave like a tulip
In the bar like a pool stick
808 Toomp shit, Magic Mike, poof bitch
I'mma tattoo
Kodak you, close up
Ain't no UFO, no Yela's a supernova
30 aught 6
Cause I'm from The Varsity, it may be hard to get RC Cola, hold up
Yeah you're famous so what
I bet you can't hitch that semi up to this tow truck
Rich with a hundred dollars
Soul like a batch of collards
Yeah, I'm pale but I'll impale you with an Impala
Roll with pimp scholars
ATLiens
A-L-A-B-A-M-A
Baby I know I ain't that crazy
The scale says heavy
Must be my dick the way bitches been hanging on it lately
soul funk crusader maybe
Got Decatur, East Point, College Park
and the SWATs
Campbellton Road closed, road block, watch out for the cops
Fore somebody hit the jackpot playing in your slot, boy stop
