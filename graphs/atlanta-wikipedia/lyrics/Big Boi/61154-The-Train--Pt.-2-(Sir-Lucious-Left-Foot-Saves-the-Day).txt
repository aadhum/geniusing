[Hook: Sam Chris]
But not like Captain Save
More like black Captain Kirk, because Big Boi's from some other place
Oh way deep in outer space where the freaks are not afraid
To crank that bitch in the moonlight while nobody's getting paid
enter Dungeon Family
With Outkast, Goodie Mob, & P.A. now were Gnarly like Barkley
Without Harley Davidson, maybe someday you will see
Boy, we been done gave you some, the pipe has already been laid
Foundation sturdy as ankle weights or shoe of cement
Kids, common sense ain't common when your minds trapped in a fence
But mines is that intense, hence the way that I spit my shit
Cause I'm fire breathing (fire breathing) dragon in this biiitch
Which is a girl dog, yet a pitfall
For me and y'all, songs found no bombs, but the ones rock
It's all wrong
Look up, up and I pray
Channeling that heavenly energy
There's plenty we can say
But the enemy is winning because your punk ass be afraid
But I spray what's on my mind to educate and entertain
KRS, he said it best I learned from listening to these tapes
Before I-iTunes came out and made CDs obsolete
And now Big Brother's got these cameras deep in each and every state
While each in every rapper claims to be the heavyweight
Cause he mentions cocainia in bout everything he make
And they wonder why them people try to pin him with that case
Cause his blow his dixie crystal
pistol play was just for play, fake
