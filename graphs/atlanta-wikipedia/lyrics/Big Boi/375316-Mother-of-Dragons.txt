you need only... reach out and take it!
Dungeon dragons, kings and queens
Before Khaleesi take the Iron Throne
They call her the mother of dragons, you under attack, nigga this our home
It's Targaryen, the rightful bloodline
Red Weddin'
See the question is to be or not to be
And pappy didn't blame me so I'm considered the blessin'
You win or you die, the White Walkers and Grim Reapers
Either you end it or not, not get caught with death or treason
So fuck the Lannisters and everyone that ride with 'em
Jon Snow and the Night's Watch finna slide some iron in 'em
