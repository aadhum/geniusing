As the world shakes unharmed
Twan,
calm in the middle of the storm bomb
Flow tsunami, ring the alarm
Big Boi for dummies come and get some
Uhh, wisdom, like yo back teeth
Or get the fuck on, like some bad chi
Negative energy not tolerated
You all about a dollar and I'm exonerated
Freefalling, Tom Petty heartbreaker
Living legend,
art major
Cause I make major art
Like Beethoven, Van Gogh, or Mozart so don’t start
Around these parts we reign supreme
And stay Krispy Kreme clean
Jordans
Number 3's, that’s important
[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
Be careful how you play your cards (My mama told me)
Be true to self and you’ll go far (That's what mama told me)
Try not to break too many hearts
I always knew I’d be a star
Mama used to say take your time
Well I’m a pickpocket when I design rhymes
Every little step I take like Bob Brown
It's so profound that when I throw those nouns
We gon' get low low down until we get back up
Everything gravy, taters mashed up
You know I keep a full plate
And a full thing of hot ones, throw away 38's
But everything's straight, Bleed, shit
I got everything I can need
Me, boy, I’m everything you can’t see
Like three blind mice, on the chase of some great cheese
And Cheddar Man say he got some great trees
Say he serve me and my nigga Three G
you niggas boring
[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
