(Oh No!) I caught him with a blow to the chest
(Oh No!) My hollow put a hole in his vest
(Oh No!) I'm bout to send two to his dome
(Oh No!) Cry babies go home!
You frostin' like a flake and Ludacris feels grrreat!
women give me face until they're face turns blue
They can't breathe, dick to mouth resuscitation
A tight squeeze witch stops the length to conversations
I'm Doctor Love, I close curtains and fuck patients
I'll take a bite out of crime
And it'll hurt if I swallow, but even more if I choke
You see I'm ambidextrous: I slap ass with both hands
When niggas sold quarters and dimes and smoked nickels
I got a Wheel of Fortune cause I flipped O's like Vanna White
