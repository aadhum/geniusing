Listen, look I gotta feed my family by all means necessary
Cause paychecks are coming up shorter than February
And even Hogan Knows Best, I'm all about the muscle
I'm 'bout supply and demand, I'm 'bout to serve the fiends
So I stay in heavy rotation like a washing machine
Can't keep up with the news but I get that Daily Paper
My baby need new shoes, her momma need Giuseppe's
Mercedes need new shoes surrounded with Pirellis
So if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense
