Oh Lord Jesus I wish you'd taketh away Sister Mary's wig
Oh you disrespectin' the House of God with that thing

Boy I'm glad you finally grew into them ears
Either I'm smarter cause of my daughter or I'm just too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense
And I've been...
Searchin' so long, I was lost in the clouds
I'm tryna' stay strong, and make you proud
It took me some time, but now I see
That He resides, in me yeah, yeah
But thanks for givin' the gift of rap to write my feelings down
And sorry for cursin' sometimes but feelings make me shout 'em out
Forgive Oprah for editin' most my comments off her show
Don't get me wrong, I know some people got a image to hold
But those who criticize the youth might just be gettin' too old
But I'm just speakin' MY truth, cause I heard it sets you free
And my conversation's with God, even though he speaks through me
I'm smarter cause of my daughter, and I'm NOT too dense
I'm 28 years old, it just now started makin' sense
And I've been...
The Bible says that when I was a child, I spoke as a child

Did you not know that your environment has shaped you?
Where you were born, in the projects, in the ghettoes
In the upper downtown, wherever it was
The people around you, the things around you
Cause you to do strange things because, you were seeking to learn
But what you learned, was on the streets, and not in the book
God called you a prophet
When you open up your mouth, everything of God comes out
And it commands attention, it commands change
I'm talking about the power, that's inside of you
Is there forth any man be in Christ, he is a new creation
And I may have done the things, that they said I did
But I'm not, who they say I am;
