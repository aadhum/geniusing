Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
In one year I got rich, now life's movin so fast
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Shout out to Bill O'Reilly, I'mma throw you a curve
You mad cause I'm a THIEF and got away with words
I'mma start my own beverage, it'll calm your nerves
Pepsi's the New Generation - BLOW IT OUT YA ASS!
Watch out, my album's puttin up McDonald's numbers
