If you live for somethin'
You're not alone my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter
A toast to life
They say what don't kill me can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
Because why tip-toe through life to arrive safely at death
And tonight is the night I gotta feeling I'm about to act a fool
If I got one life to live, I'mma party 'til I'm dead
What the hell is a life worth living if it's not on the edge
Trying to keep my balance, I'm twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone should say "Women, Weed, and Alcohol"
Cause I feel inner peace when I'm out of my mind
