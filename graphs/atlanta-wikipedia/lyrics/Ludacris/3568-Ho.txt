You doin' ho activities
With ho tendencies
Hoes are your friends, hoes are your enemies
With ho energy to do what you do
Blew what you blew
Screw what you screw
Y'all professional like DJ Clue, pullin' on my coat tail
And why do you think you take a ho to a hotel?
Ho tell everybody, even the mayor
Reach up in the sky for the ho-zone layer
Come on playa once a ho always
And hoes never close they open like hallways
And here's a ho cake for you whole ho crew
And everybody wants some cause hoes gotta eat too
Can't turn a ho into a housewife
Hoes don't act right
There's hoes on a mission, and there's hoes on a crackpipe
Hey ho how ya doin', where ya been?
Prolly doin' ho stuff cause there you ho again
It's a ho wide world, that we livin' in
Feline, feminine, fantastical women
Not all, just some
You ho who you are
There's hoes in the room, there's hoes in the car
There's hoes on stage, there's hoes by the bar
Hoes by near, and hoes by far
You gotta run in your panty ho
Even your daddy knows
That you suckin down chocolate like daddy-os
You hoes are horrible, horrendous
On taxes y'all writin' off hoes as dependents
I see the ho risin', it ain't surprisin'
It's just a hoasis with ugly chicks faces
But hoes don't feel so sad and blue
Cause most of us niggas is hoes too
