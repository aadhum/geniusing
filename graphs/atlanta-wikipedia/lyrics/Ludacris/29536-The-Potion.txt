[Intro]
Whattup? Hey shawty what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty what it is?
Whattup? Hey shawty what it is?
Man I'm like a needle in a haystack, so face that
Go back to the drawing board, connect dots, but can't trace that
Ludacris born in Illinois
Raised in Atlanta, tote hammer since I was a little boy
Ain't nobody like me, say they wanna bite me
just cause he's light-skinneded
With braids in his hair don't mean that nigga looks like me
Trick get your mind right, livin in the limelight
So picture what they'll do for my jimmy and a Klondike
Clean everyday, stay fresher than what's in a Ziploc
I'm in, then it's hard to get me out like I'm a slip knot
Born to be a leader and not, no not a follower
Only hang with chicks that got mo' twists than Oliver
Not much of a hollerer, but I'd like to borrow her lips
Bringin out the best in me 'specially if she a swallower
Freaky deaky yellow man, and I'm sayin hello man
To all the lovely ladies that like to jiggle like Jello man
And if it ain't no ass where I'm at, then I'm in the wrong place
Got pop potential, stay black like Bob Johnson
Who the hell is that in that fancy car?
And jump down turn around, pick a bail of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bail of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bail of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bail of hay
Jump down turn around, pick a bail of cotton
Jump down turn around, pick a bail of hay
Oh lordy, pick a bail of cotton
Oh lordy, pick a bail of hay
Still working like a slave, learning tricks of the trade
Life no different than those on minimum wage
More money but still locked in a similar cage
