Do your time, don't let your time do you
You lookin' at a man that would die for his daughter
Just to let her breathe,
and I'd definitely die for Jesus cause he died for me
Give my eyes to Stevie Wonder just to see what he's seen
But then I'd take 'em right back to see Martin Luther's dream
I'd dream that I could tell Martin Luther we made it
But half of my black brothers are still incarcerated
But he never struck a deal cause his mouth will never squeal
Born in this way of livin and our youth is stuck
To be safe it's safe to say the justice system's fucked up
That box, a motherfucker - it could stress a nigga balls
Especially when you broke and home base ain't acceptin' your calls
And you don't hear your name when it's mail time
Goddamn jailhouse barbers pushin' back on your hairline
Fuckin' Sinequan'll have you stuck in that pill-line
The canteen ran out of menthols
Can't see how grown men wash other men drawers
if your people locked up you need to send 'em some shit
A magazine and some pictures is a nigga's whole world
When I was down them niggas fell off so I'm ridin' with the girls
And three months later that nigga came home too
Ain't No Limit to this shit cause now his dream's comin' Tru
I'ma keep ridin with Bun cause UGK will never stop
And I'mma stand up for my partner, steady let them off a lot
With a shotgun, burnin' at the back of your dome
You gotta fight for your shoes, or get your ass shook
And walk around with lipstick, and a pocketbook
To the homeboy Shyne, stay up homie
To my nigga Mystikal, stay up homie
