I got the whole world scared like ebola nigga
I can't recall the last time I was sober nigga
One life to live
Fuck my liver and my lungs im a stoner
If they go bad, Ima find me a donor
Fucked around and smoked on my high school diploma
Im smart (I'm smart)
You could say I got the highest grade man
Yo bitch for my bitch naw thats not really a trade man
My life is a little bit different than yours
Bitches are a little bit thicker than yours
Whips are a little bit quicker than yours
And my crib is a little bit sicker than yours
And these rappers couldn't leave their mark in ce-ment
With they hands planted
