Empty beer bottles and roaches
Please like when police say freeze
And I ain't do shit but I'm down on my knees
A black man but I feel so blue
So I smoke green and purple til my dreams come true
And my eyes turn red, the sky turns grey
Children slangin white in the hood, we call it yay
Drinkin' Ol' Gold down my yellow brick road
s been
life
Sometimes I can't deal with my daily issues just being sober
Lifes a bitch and I can't control her
I wish I could and sometimes to cry on we need a shoulder
