Over a decade later
Let's toast to the good life
We still living the hood life
Welcome to my world Ludaversal
Listen
I think I got the best job in the world
Cuz I ain't gotta take the piss test
Michael sending me Jordans every 1st of the month
Said his kids love me, ain't paid for a pair of kicks since
Why is it that when 'em niggas gettin' rich
The whole world just wanna get you some free shit? (Hahah)
Ain't that 'bout a bitch
I kicked it off with me and my special team and shot the [?] to me
Yeah, and I been going around in circles
Like everyday is a rehearsal
Is my life your entertainment?
This has been my world, Ludaversal
This has been my world, Ludaversal
This has been my world, Ludaversal
My life your entertainment
This has been my world, Ludaversal
So I opened up the blinds to the sky on
Wish that I could talk to God on my iPhone
I thank Him for all of his generosity
Fans asking me what it's like to be me
I always tell 'em it's more good than bad
They say I want what you got
I tell 'em you'll never have shit if you don't appreciate what you have
[Big Rube]
Just Blaze!
