Theater of the Mind
They say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward
Cause you are who you are when nobody's lookin
That's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow
Ski mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars
Twenty thousand different species of bees
Some have poisonous stings, some just pollen their leaves
It's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack
[Jay-Z]
Hip-hop, started out in the park
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark
Can get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
Thank God for Kool Herc
Shout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz
And even Jaz bum-ass
