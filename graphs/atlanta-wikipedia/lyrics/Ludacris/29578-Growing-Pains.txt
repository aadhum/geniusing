High rights, low lefts, even stevens and fades
Troops, Lottos, and BKs, those was the days
Barry him told his bitch go to the prom and die
Didn't lie shot his-self in the head with the 4-5
When she disobeyed
Key Lo
No matter what we went through
It was me and my crew
And that's how it went
When we were kids
Played with Transformers, G.I. Joe's and Thundercats
Crown Victorias police unmarked cars
Be aware, Wayne Williams was out there, but we ain't care
Kids was gettin stabbed and ditched out there too busy playin
broke niggas call 'em non cents
No comments, it's Lil' Fate payin homage to College Park
I had a Long John but no Silver, no gold or plat
I was simply red from the years I been holdin' back
And set fires in garbage pails and cabbage patches
A child of the corn been wild since I was born
Climbin' over barbed wire, clothes got torn
Shoes got muddy and my clique turned cruddy
Wherever I go they went they my buddies
I brush teeth, brush naps and calm streets
Dreamin' of Cadillacs, wood wheels and plush seats
Cats with gold teeth and raps with such beats
Macks with no grief and some sacks of green leaf
When I loaded my cap gun I was ready for action
Starin' at beer cans and a moment to crack one
Wanna hang with the big boys and play with the big toys
And be with the people makin all that got damn noise, man
