Weeeeeeeeeeeeellll
It’s that nigga you been waitin' on
Tryna get more information, conversatin', debatin' and hatin' on
I’m faded, I’m smashed
Throw that stink all in that blunt
I done got rich and lost my damn mind
Platinum plaques got a nigga celebratin' all the damn time
Luda!
Quit foolin' around and get some work done
No, I’d rather go to Magic and see a bitch twerk some
I think I, I think I deserve it, I’m in that Guinness Book
People see me in the movies and they think I went Hollywood
Only difference is I’m poppin' a molly with a bunch of Mollies and poppin' does a molly good
It does, I mean it really does
Was that Luda in the Lamborghini? I mean it really was
Hurry up and get a picture on yo iPhone
And turn around, bend over and let me get one on my phone (say cheese)
Since ’99 I’ve been in go mode
"Aye, did Luda really fuck yo girl?"
What you fuckin' think?
