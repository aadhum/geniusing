Ah yeah, we sending this one out
From everybody I mean to everybody from the H-Town to the A-Town to worldwide
[I'm screwed up]
I had some bud, I lit it up, and then I made it disappear
I'm leaning like the Tower of Pisa
Come close to my stash, and get treated as if I'm Ebeneezer
Hit it twice but don't cough
Then I don't know how many cells is left in my fucking brain
But I'mma keep on writing and lighting
fired crackers
On the Fourth of July
Me and Cris like cheech & chong
And if you wanna pass the sobriety and breathalyzer test
Here's a quick Luda tip some packets of mustard in your car
