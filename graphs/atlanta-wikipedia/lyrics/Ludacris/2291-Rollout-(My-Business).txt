Roll out
Tell me who's your weed man and how do you smoke so good?
You's a superstar, boy, why you still up in the hood?
Man, that car don't come out, until next year
Where in the fuck did you get it?
That's eighty thousand bucks gone
Where in the fuck did you spend it?
Now, who's that bucket naked cook, fixin' three course meals?
Gettin' goosebumps with her body tapped in six inch heels
Play station two up in the ride
Lorenzo kitted
Is that your wife, your girlfriend or just your main bitch?
What about diamonds and gold
Is that what you keep in your mouth?
What in the world is in that case, what you got in that case?
