Keep my name out your mu'fuckin' mouth (out yo' mouth) {*3X*}
Cause I was raised in the motherfuckin' south (in the south)
Where there's money, all my dawgs, go and fetch that
Niggas robbin' in the hood, we don't sweat that
Throw some some red dots up on your head and connect that
And I been drinkin' I'm not really in my right mind
Knock your livin' daylights out, bitch, night time
if you don't give 'em then we gon' take 'em
Go and get 'em or we gon' chase him, go stick him and might erase him
Or turn him into a patient, any demon's we gon' face 'em
Or see all the pigs and all that bacon, we gon' as-salamu alaykum
These pussy niggas only talkin' cause they got lips
Got them niggas bustin' off the motorcycle like Chips (haha)
Think I seen them round Bloods, so they mighta been Crips
All this rappin' ain't no action, see I can't respect that (nah)
Bout to ask him for that trap, and nigga I'mma check that (DAAAMN)
I'm so high up in this bitch look like I got a jet pack (WHOO)
So bought some 26s before you played her like Bill
your
Cause in these motherfuckin' streets, +I Am Legend+ like Will
These niggas is sweeter than a sweet potato
softer than Play-Doh
and our blocks come together like Legos,
I'm possessed, stick a needle in your back like a nigga doing voodoo curses
Givin' them a two piece with a biscuit and hell no I ain't talkin 'bout churches (OHHH)
