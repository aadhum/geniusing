Jason Aldean
When all your love is lost
And burning bridges can't be crossed
Lord won't you let me know
Or give me one more reason to go
Is it cause you'll never sell as many records?
My bitches always look better, you fail at business endeavours?
I see them drugs got y'all trippin' too soon
That's why you find me in the club, every once in a blue moon
But when I talk by the same teachers and principals
These bridges burning so fast, we can't just stomp 'em out
