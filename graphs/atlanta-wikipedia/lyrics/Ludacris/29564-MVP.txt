'DTP's about that bomb shit!"
They sneak dissin niggas, throwin little jabs like Bam Bam
But I'm a bad man, they amateurs like at Apollo
I wipe em off the stage like Sandman
It's Ludacris, I got more cheese than provolone
And the chrome is home, so I'm never home alone
And only keep friends with two X chromosomes
Throw a grenade in your mouth, nigga bite down!
Premo on the track
I heat the booth up so much, the engineer caught a muthafuckin tan
I hold hip-hop for hostage, since 2000, I put a gun to it
And I run through it, like a Jamaican Bolt
And everyday's a vacation on Jamaican smoke
Cloud your whole block
talk shit and hear the fo' pop
One, two and it don't stop
Hennessey is my remedy, takin shots like Kennedy
To these streets, I'm connected like I'm online
Eight years in the game
And he the first southern rapper on a Premo beat
And I shoot a hot 16 from the baseline
I'm on point like CP3
