I'm drunk, I'm rich
I'm flexin, ain't that a bitch?
Bitches all on my jock, they want my Dang-a-lang
Swinging all on my nuts like an orangutan
Half a million dollar car
Half a million dollar watch
chopped
Swagger's through the ceiling
I'm drunk, I'm rich
I'm flexin, ain't that a bitch?
Bitches be crying for me, they want my autograph
Shorty rollercoaster ridin: Six Flags
Magnums for protection
No rocks on the road Luda? Bitch they all in my damn chain
