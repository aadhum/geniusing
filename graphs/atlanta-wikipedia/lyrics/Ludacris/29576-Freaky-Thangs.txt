[Intro: Ludacris]
It's two a.m. in the morning and its uhh
Light showers and
you're probably hookin up with that girl
That's been, two-wayin you all week
Her baby daddy's out of town so uhh, you can fuck around
that Motel 6
$59.95, not a cent more
Stop by that convenience store
pick up them rubbers
Magnum I hope
Faizon Love
Cut up! Know we like that, get that cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
Get that cut up! Oh-whooooooo, cut up
Freaky thangs, we be bout 'em
I'm kinda hopin that maybe you wanna kick it in the
L.A.C
So later on we'll be rollin'
Drop tops
I'm hittin' yo' hot spots
I'm top notch
My niggas never listen but I told 'em
When I catch you at the game runnin game at the
A.U.C
Fat cats, I'm ready to tap that,
wonder why you wakin' up up swollen
smokin my buddha
coochie recruiter
Comin at the fatty in a platinum Caddy so back it up fast
Hit it a hour and a half, watch the spectacular splash
From slow pokin, to locomotion
I'm rippin the buttons off yo' blouse
Check the ratio of men to women and women to men when down south
fellatio
hot jalapenos, holla while they in yo' mouth
And I hope we be the same thang - freaks
We can get the mattress goin 'eh-err, eh-err'
Cum six times, but it's seven today
"Adrenaline Rush"
Fatty flickin' like it was dubs on it
Range
Where the royal penis is clean, yo' majesty
Tallywhacker is a rock hard stormtrooper
With a purple helmet, made for crushin pink cookies
Goonie goo-goo, we cut bigfoots
