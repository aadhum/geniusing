Jam  till they  Def
Slick Dick Da Ruler
Southern offender, fuckin up ya whole agenda
When I walk you try to run, when I run you try to hide
+Golden Glide+
Its you and I, Do or Die, who am I?
+Family Stone+, cats think I'm +Sly+
rip out Excursions til there's no seats left
I be dat nigga Bronze Bridges
Playaz wanna ball but go on strike cause of my pitches
Y'all in school detention that'll neva come out
Man I'll cut yo achilles tendon and put a sock in yo' mouth
You see we Jack and we Daniels, y'all Earl and Ralph
4-Ize twirl it out, lick it dry and tend it to flames
Not even Joshua can come to +War+ wit dese +Games+
These bitch niggas is lame and comin' down wit da reigns
You all wet behind the ears but its a drought in ya brain
Shorty up at da radio station?
I be dat nigga da +Lova Lova+
I'm nastier than thinkin about yo' parents sex each other
No glove, no love, betta tell yo' dick to run for cover
So when lightnin strikes, you can be safe on a few rubbers
Not everybody's Mr. and Mrs. Clean
Some get burnt like Freddy Krueger, sweet dreams
Girls "backin dey ass up" now they +400 Degreez+, ha
I rock worlds with my nine inch Louisville slugga
Still wonder why they call me Lova Lova?
I bring 'em "Back to the Future" like a '85 Delorean
I place the stethoscope quite close to yo tittie
And have yo butt checks Red-man like Uncle Quilly
