Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man
Drop! 2 Fast
Drop! 2 Furious
I'm too fast for y'all, man
Talkin about gats, traps, cops and robbers
You about to catch a cold, STAY THE FUCK AROUND FROM ME
You think twelve gon catch me, GIMMIE A BREAK
We go FRONT, BACK AND SIDE TO SIDE, WHAT
With the pedal to the floor, radar in the GRILLE
Now them gulls up the block still runnin they mouth
I got my eyes wide shut and my trunk wide open
So gulls hold ya weave
MAN, THAT AIN'T STICKY, THAT'S JUST STICKS AND STEAMS
