My heart colder, hip-hop I'm part owner
Ready to die for my respect, my value, my worth
Unequivocal, lyrical beast on every fuckin' verse!
Somebody said I'm washed up, I told 'em "Pass me the lotion"
Cause sleep's the cousin of death and I could never relate!
Loyalty goes both ways but never push a loyal person to the point when they no longer give a fuck
