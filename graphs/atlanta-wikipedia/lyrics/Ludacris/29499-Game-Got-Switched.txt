I hate it when it's too many niggas, not enough hoes
Too many rookies, not enough pros
The game got switched on some Ludacris shit
So all y'all can suck my dick, BEOTCH!!
whip like Miracle
No holds barred but obey the block rules
When Organized drop the tracks then start duckin
Save all the H20 for front rows
Stay chromed out and that's on or off road
Inhale some of that 'dro but blow steam
Love a combination big ass and tight jeans
No I've lost my virginity
like that fool shot Kennedy
Hennessey
and that purple color dank
And party like a kid wit a high top fade
Arrive to a show and I like to get paid
Arrive to a ho and I like to get laid
And women go nuts just like my bozack
Electric stoves so give me the keys to the Range
Pass the E&J
The highlight's that I live a high ass life
