The time has come...for bad things to end
The time has come...for life to begin
The time has come...for the war of the gods
I never claimed to be nuthin but who the fuck I am
Never sold cocaine in my life, but I'm still the fuckin man
I fit four of your houses inside my daughters room
And still have room for young Karma to play
Givin back to the children of tommorrow, for good karma today
How many times is you gon rap about busting your gun
How many times is you gon trap without busting your gun
I paid the price and the cost to be the boss so you can rest your mouth
I'm universal, Luda never limits himself to the south
You ain't made nigga
I'm havin a house party, kid come get played nigga
You got played, my record label never jerked me
Man, mixtapes are not my resume, it's too hot
