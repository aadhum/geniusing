blaow, blaow, blaow kapaow
Who the fuck you talking to?
Not me, couldn't be me, nah not me
Who the fuck you talking to?
Not me, couldn't be me, nah not me
Y'all been monitoring, pondering bout it
How bout I pull it out and kapaowee, I'll heat 'em up as hot as Maui
Big Small World, Norfolk is the gang, extended clip in the jeans
Put 'em in a box like Bisquick
I'm a laker wit clips, get 'em in the lake wit clips
Truth is ya a clipper with clips ain't cha bitch
But you lootless and dollarless, fuck it I shot for Luda n Dolla
I been having a bad day, the same ol shit
We don't give a fuck about who you is
The same ol clique, and the same ol biz
The same ol flip , wit the same ol whip
The same 4-4, with the same ol clip
Half the bullets gone, the otha half you can get, bitch
R.I.P. Rick James
"I'm rich beyotch!!"
You talkin' to much, nigga you a snitch bitch
And when dem gats letting off
Red dots, loud noises like planes taking off
Now if a bad bitch wants dick, then it's dick I give her
Ludacris nigga, I stand and deliver
Never back down, won't shake nor shiver
Fuck with me and get found in the Chattahoochee river
This 7 inch shank, will put a stop to his ticker
But shotties to the body make him drop much quicker
Yeah I appear to be a nice lil' nigga
Fuck with anything I love, I'm a stone cold killer
Eating off of 'Sace, sleeping on chinchilla
8 figga nigga, I'm a multi milla
See me in the street, it can't get no realer
Giving back to my hood with a pocket full of scrilla
Or I'll "brrrrr-stick her, ha ha-ha stick her!"
