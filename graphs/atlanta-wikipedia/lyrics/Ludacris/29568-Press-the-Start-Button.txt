This song is rated M for mature!
I'm Raw like W.E., you'll get SmackDown!
Pullin out guns like in Contra, mo' toys than Tonka
rob 'em
It's Grand Theft Auto, his burner's right beside him
So let's box like Tyson, you'll get Punched Out
I'm Liver than NBA, Luda's Super like Mario
That Playstation 4 shit, you older than Atari ho!
Flows that'll make MC's Go! like Diego
I hope you're packed, man, I got six Virtua Fighters
That'll blitz ya like Madden '09
Or hit you with the Mac and .49s
But I'm a MechWarrior,
