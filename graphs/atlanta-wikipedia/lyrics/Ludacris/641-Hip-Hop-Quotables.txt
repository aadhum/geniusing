and I'm high as giraffe pussy
And I'm close to the edge, so your parents can come push me
I curse so much just to get on they nerves
I got kids actin' a fool from the traps to the 'burbs
My filthy mouth, it won't fight cavities or beat plaque
I take a shit on the equator, the size of a crater
And make government officials breathe harder than Darth Vader
It's the chicken and the beer that makes Luda keep rappin'
But no pork on my fork, I don't even speak pig Latin
Plus I eat many MC's
but I don't gain no weight
numba one chief rocka
y'all more shook than maracas
But my trix ain't for kids, if you dig'um you'll get smacked
I'll clock ya I'll spring forward, you fall back
Every album that I drop has got more than ten
bangers
y'all fools is Crank Yankers
Ain't a damn thing changed but the ice on my chain
To get chicks from Portland, Oregon to Portland, Maine
Now I roll up torpedoes, get blunted with rastas
For a hefty fee, I'm on your record like Bob Costas
I own so many jerseys, I'm a throwback mess
I hit the cleaners and tell 'em I want a full court press
So momma toast your glass while I'm countin' my cash
Cause every single is a smash
I'm hot as a camel's ass
And that they last about as long as my part in the wash
From yo' car to a crap game, no one rolls wit'chu
One of Mini Me's shoes got more sole than you
So by the time you figure out why your record ain't spinnin'
with President Clinton
So stand clear of the long sideburns and goatee
They made the mold of the penis enlarger off me
I'll be in another room when I hit from the back
Not to mention my refrigerator's taller than Shaq
yippie kay yay
If you can't swim, don't smoke my hydro
I've been lookin for a woman just to put my stamp on
But a lot of y'all are mo' stuck up than tampons
If God's line is busy you might have to two way him
Then catch me in your backyard, playin' croquet
drugs are bad, mmm'kay
Or watch me swing my chain at the Roscoe's off Pico
Cause I go on blind dates, with actual blind people
yours be on the shelf
I heard you masturbate a lot, so y'all keep to yourself
Cause these women want a man that stay up and stay strong
I put my foot so deep in yo' ass that you can smell it
And yo' breath will turn to Foot Locker water repellant
Take a look at yo' life, and no wonder you so sad
Y'all put up with more shit than a colostomy bag, fool
