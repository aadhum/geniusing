Excuse my absence
People been out here burnin' bridges
It seems I gotta remind you motherfuckers who I am
Yeah, in Atlanta, been that hot nigga
On my second term like Barack, nigga
Treat them like the NFL, how I drop niggas
Yeah, I have relations with your bitch, no kinship
I'm just try'na earn my stripes like a referee
Call a foul on the play, you's a ho-nigga
Sellin' records, you can't even sell an O, nigga
And I'm smokin' on that knockout
New school niggas missin' credits like they dropped out
Fight the power
