Cause the nigga don't really know how to do ya
How many rubberbands it would take for you lil' mama to be apart of my plan?
You a grown-ass woman, I'm a grown-ass man
So we both know a lot about the birds and the bees
Hold up shawty let's conversate, conjugate, constipate
So let's go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine
