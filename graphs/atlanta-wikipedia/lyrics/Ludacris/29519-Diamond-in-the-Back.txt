Gangsta whitewalls, TV antennas in the back (the back, the back...)
I wanna (diamond in the back)
I wanna (sunroof top)
I wanna (diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
No more blowin' Nintendo cartridges
I'm sick and tired of ridin' public transportation
I'm willin' to do what it takes, whatever the stakes
In order to get myself some dollar bills
I hope he come back with enough to let me borrow some change
At least for the summer
And if he dont let me borrow nothin, but ask me what I want
Ima tell him I wanna...
Tax free, and I know a lot of people that love to screw
Yeah, it's just a way of the world, with boys and girls
I'm adjustin' to my environment
This government cheatin' us, so I'll cheat 'em back
