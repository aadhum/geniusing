I be that nigga named Luda
A.K.A. L-O-V-A, L-O-V-A
I drop shit like birds
While we relax to the tight raps, and the fat tracks
That a nigga Timbaland put down
I can make a ho get like Forrest Gump and just "run baby run"
Fatter than fat, fat like a dub sack
Get the cut up, then I cut out
And it's always in the back of my mind
Whatever the place, whatever the time
give me a thigh, breast, and leg like Mrs. Winter
shatter your bladder
And put so much light in yo' life I'll make the roaches scatter
Nick nack paddy wack, give a dog a bone Jack
Yo' love is supa-cala-fragalistic
Reminisce like Mary
In the case of an emergency, break the glass
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast, feel me
Dirty South, (uh huh) can y'all really feel me
East Coast, feel me
West Coast
