[Quik] You mean like, paid off a Cadillac car note?
[Luda] Like a Cadillac
In Compton we call that "spur of the moment"
Well let's do it, spur of the moment, whattup?
Well you can bring the drinks a little mo' my way
More I say, on another hot sunny Cali-for-nye day
8-1-8
And I cruised up the block, car losed up the top
buddha
Seagram's bumpy and juice
Gettin lit, then I wonder why my head kept spinnin
But I'm all grown up now, less throwin up now
Fresh haircut, so I'm feelin quite kipper
Can't nothin go wrong cause my strap's on my back
And if fools wanna scrap then my tool will attack
But forget the click-clack, ain't no need for the steel
