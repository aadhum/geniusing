It's inevitable and incredible, listen, it's Luda!
By the end of the night you gon' be wantin to marry a nigga
Cause I make 'em erupt like volcanoes, you just shake and you shiver
Cut 'em up like Jason, just face it that boy Luda's a killer
Wake 'em up like Folgers
cause I fold 'em like origami
Hey mami let's get it poppin' like Orville Redenbacher
Sweeter than Betty Crocker,
I be up in that cat, make her put a hump in that back
meet me at the Marriott
Your Jimmy Choo's are so sexy but Giuseppe's is mean
