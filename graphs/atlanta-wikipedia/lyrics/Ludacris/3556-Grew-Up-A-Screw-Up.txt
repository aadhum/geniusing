[Hook: Notorious B.I.G. sample]
"I grew up a fucking screw-up
Got introduced to the game, to the game then fucking blew up"
Yeah! Dedicated to all my hustlers that's a product of they environment
Whether getting money legally or ILLEGALLY
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive man!
Ever since I was an embryo, waiting to shape up and ship out
Something in my brain said, "Wake up and kick out!"
Roberta and Wayne
Cause when I came I was draped up and dripped out
Snip the umbilical, spit the government chip out
Peace up, A-Town down
And oh my gosh, the Osh Kosh was picked out
I slipped in, even my baby stroller was tricked out
Put a little bit of rum in my bottle I'll dream about diamonds and gold
Gold gold
The essence of adolescence got my body feeling freshen
Freshing freshing, and it was a blessing to rhyme and start rapping
I was the best in my section with flows hard than erections
Still the best but now I'm grown with more range than a Texan
And I'm a heavyweight you niggas is lighter than my complexion
Homey fronted me a sip, shit I made it a bird
YEAH, five bricks and my Gucci duffle bag
A corporate thug, I run with a Playaz Circle
Finish counting my bread and I was getting some head
And five course meals, no more Popeye's and Blimpie's
From hanging on the block to throwing parties in the Hamptons
From, broke as a joke to rich as a bitch, I bought a
Plane and a boat and six other whips, no MARTA
I went from ashy to classy
Went from a, kiss on the cheek to doing the nasty
