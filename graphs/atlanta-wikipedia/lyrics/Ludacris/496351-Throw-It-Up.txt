With Flip Mode and DTP, shit be gettin' ugly
Weezy tell 'em what you rep..(I represent Young Money)
I'm about to blast off call it rocket science
Hey welcome to the jungle, and I'm the lion
I throw it up like a cap and tassel
I got my rap diploma
I Got them burners on ya, have you lookin' at a Russian Ruger
I'll be lookin' like a human torch
Hip-Hop's God in these jeans, now that's true religion
You couldn't fill my shoes, You couldn't fill my jockey
My niggas fight over ice like we been playin' hockey
When I spit, niggas be askin' "Who dat"
It be the god
And I know you niggas really wanna know how the hell I "Do dat"
And the way that I come through
And kill every single thing when I rhyme
