See, everyday I put in work and my salary grows
So excuse me I'm not caught up on reality shows
See the Bridges Family values on the south side
I live in Atlanta but do not have an Atlanta housewife
I'm not married, I've never been engaged
But your dumb-ass believes whatever's on the front page
But there's a thin line between genius and insanity
Now private pics on my private, no longer private, man
Hope I can gets some privacy up on my private plane
I'm doing interviews
Getting asked the same questions from 10 years ago
Wondering to myself what the fuck I'm there for
Now that my daughter's a CEO at the age of 10
And I got restaurants inside Atlanta's airport
Yeah, and then I went to Quincy Jones' house
Realize I didn't have shit, got some work to do
And if you don't put some music out
These niggas gon' be over you
Talking about where that old Luda, for the rapper's sake
But Ursher told me if I don't evolve I'll evaporate
And when people say Luda's underrated, I'd agree with 'em
They said I'm so visual, they overlook the lyrics
Wrote a song for my girl she couldn't stand straight
My man said, "don't release it, you'll ruin your female fan base"
I said, "man, my female fan base gon' be here for forever"
Cause even though I'm with one, to them we're still together
And who am I to tell 'em different if my voice can freak 'em
Long as I can continue coming through all of that speakers
Especially when all of my bills are paid for
And God answered everything that I prayed for
