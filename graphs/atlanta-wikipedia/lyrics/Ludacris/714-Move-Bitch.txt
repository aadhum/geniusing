Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Oh no! The fight's out
I'm bout to punch your lights out
Get the fuck back,
guard your grill
There's something wrong, we can't stay still
I've been dranking and busting too
thanking of busting you
Upside your motherfuckin' forehead
And if your friends jump in
mo' dead
Disturbin' Tha Peace
groupies and gold diggers
I'm doing a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the fuck outta my wa
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
And you abouts to get ran the fuck over
Here I come, here I go
Uh oh, don't jump bitch: move!
Start that goddamn show, I'm comin' through
I fuck the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to fuck 'em - true, true
Hold up, wait up, shorty
Oh what's up, getting my dick sucked, what are you doing
Sidelining my fuckin' business
Trying to get my paper, child support suing
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these fucking TV's and jewelry bitch, tell me that
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a fuck
But I'mma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus
2-0, I'm on the right track
grab the pump
showing scars out
robbing
throwing bows
I'm from the Dec', try to disrespect D.T.P
Fuck this rap shit, we clap bitch, two in ya body
