[Intro]
Warning! This album contains Ludacris material
Parental discretion is advised
So kids cover your ears and close your eyes
Otherwise you're about to witness HISTORY
HEY! I be that nigga named LUDA give a round of applause
They say I'm up to no good, I'll say I'm down for the cause
Down for whatever goes down, I'm strapped down to my drawers
So if you up for some stitches then I'm down for some scars
Down to make 'em GET DOWN, stop playin and pause
There's two things I'll never break and that's my word and my balls
So here's a temporary fix for your permanent flaws
This album helps you to RELEASE cause life is irkin us all
Enough to make you wanna break shit, no longer will I take shit
From ANY of these clowns cause I'm TIRED of this fake shit
I'm ready for some action, ready with a passion
Like pots with the steam I'm ready to get it crackin
It's six years and countin if you think I'm a joke
Me gettin served is like Bill Gates and Oprah goin broke
It's 'bout time they gave it to me, I'm the reignin champ
Your favorite rapper went to Ludacris' trainin camp
Beotch!
I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT HE SAID ABOUT OPRAH!
DON'T NOBODY TALK BAD ABOUT OPRAH!
YOU JUST LOST A FAN
