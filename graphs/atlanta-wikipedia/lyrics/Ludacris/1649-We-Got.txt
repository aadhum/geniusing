[Verse 2 - Tity Boi]
A-B-C-D-E-F shawty is you a G or what
Now it's just me and my nuts, that's all I got in this world
I'm pulling pistols out my stomach
Serving the club, head shot, scattered, covered, run, scram 'em
I'm 38, hot with a pearl handle
And I'm throwing techs like a NBA ref
I got, all gold guns like they came from I-RAQ
Anyway, plus I got bullets in the clip the size of Lil Fate
And I'm waving choppers like heli-copters
You gonna need hella doctors, when the glok go
Say on the set bitch, better watch your lip those Tecs be quick
20 over thurr, Tity over thurr, Luda over thurr, ain't no exit trick
Us you don't mess with, we got them guns like action flicks
Who want that they fucked
You all
You all lives made up, like ugly hoes with make-up bra
We'll suit you up then toss yo ass in the lake tough nut
My wrist rocky, like Sylvester Stallone
Peace to Nick, but my cannon go
Bleeding so hard you'll need a life size maxi pad
So flip the script and tell your woman its your time of the month
A.K. 47 for the niggas who's really looking for heaven and a 9 for you chumps
But I got bananas for you niggas and I ain't talking bout fruit
Iâ€™ll peel your cap back with the black mac
'Til your back crack, cock the gat back like (clak clak clak)
Ill leave 'em coughing like the sound effects you hear in this song
