2010, that's right, we in the future
Atlanta, Georgia
I see why +Everybody Hates Chris+ - YOU LIGHT-SKINNED BIATCH!!
{Cannon...}
Hey! Okay now, this is for the Gs' and this is for the hustlers
This Bentley GT can make Luda disappear faster than David COPPERFIELD, mutha-FUCKA!
...Hahaha
Hit the club and go and party with some Penthouse freaks
I guess that's why +Everybody Hates Chris+
Hey, now I stay fresh to death draped in gangsta fits
Over twelve million sold, I drop gangsta hits (yes sir!)
Oh no! Here comes trouble, my vision is skewed
I can only see in doubles, two models, two bottles
That'll pop like bubbles, and when I get home {Two...one...zero..}
The girls' tops lift off like air space shuttles (Liftoff {*rocket flies*})
My car got a face lift
Then I be with Bobby V. on that +Anonymous+ shit - you hear me
I go for BROKE like TLC
Cause Luda was set for LIFE after three LPs
Still counting, still climbing the charts
And rappers still talking shit like they was rhyming in farts
I cross the finish line twice, they still trying to start
But my infrared beam will make 'em shine in the dark
He got six albums, what you tryin to fill up an iPod, nigga?!
Ludacris, onstage at the Oscars
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
That nigga onstage at the Oscars
I don't like it, I don't like it one motherfuckin bit
Taking parts, from good actors {*audience laughs*}
This motherfucker can't act
Ah, Hustle & Flow - NIGGA, YOU PLAYED YOURSELF!
