Now before my nigga Jeezy made this song for the city
Before Wayne put out a milli and then in a week he sold a milli
Before Janet Jackson went on the tube and showed her titty
You could ask Dallas Austin you could ask Rico Wayde
I kept the lights on in Atlanta when Goody and Cash took a break
Cuz I gotta make myself clear just like a bottle of Goose
First nigga with a polo beat I pimped all ova the world
This is just a little verse so that these boys don't forget
I put on
