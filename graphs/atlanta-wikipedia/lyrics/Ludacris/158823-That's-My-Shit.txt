This the hardest beat I ever heard
That's my shit, that's my shit nigga, that's my shit
[Verse 1: Shawn Jay]
Ballin in the mall with Chaka
Turn your lady to a bopper, watch how I take your ho
Niggas see I get that money, now they wanna wait to blow
Underground grindin, perfect timing in a crazy flow
Put Georgia on your mind and now I'm ridin on the radio
[Verse 2: Smoke]
Watch the chamillion paint flop, like Chingy's last album
