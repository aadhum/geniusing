Check 1, 2 speak into the microphone
Tell that bitch to speak into the microphone
Now work it work it, cause practice make perfect, OK (x4)
I love it when she do it, she do it how I like it
I love it when she spits them verses
When she finish with that mic it make me want to buy some purses
And this microphone's expensive so I hope she never drop it
I beat it like a drum, I tap it like some snares
And she got that type of skills that make you think she won a Grammy
Grab that drink, roll up the purp
We wasted in the studio
Just a little gangster paradise we like Coolio
She goin' make me sign her to a record deal
Hit the store and buy her some giuseppe heels
