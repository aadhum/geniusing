Rubbing' on that Italian leather
Then Konvict jeans on!
I get it in 'til sunrise
Doing 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screaming "Ahhh!"
Hey-ey-ey... I'm so paid
Why do you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla and I don't need them!
crooked I
Doing a 100 on the Interstate 95
My shawty leanin', blasting that Do or Die
Wishing that motherfuckin' would, â€˜cause we're certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hoping they never call off
And them snipers sitting on the roof already saw y'all
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than let them haters come and make the name off me
That's why
She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money, I should've been a Porsche (vroom)
Paint look like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocket full
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress
Used to get bored and count 20's for practice
Paper therapy we let money relax us
Gold chains around my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killing in the water,
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm paying them for
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing running
Black Royals holdin' down Jersey
Boo
Ahem,
Big Money Weezy
White wife beater with the Sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin', we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house
Damn, but I thought you was tough, though
We carry choppers on our necks; call it cut throat
We bomb first when we ride
You in a hearse when you ride
Young Moolah
