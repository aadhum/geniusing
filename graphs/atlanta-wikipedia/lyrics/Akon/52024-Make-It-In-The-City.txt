This for all my grinders world wide
totting my Glock
Weighing product on a triple beam
I even got hassled a lot, mainly by crooked cops
Trying to make it in a city
Where we stay on the grind
locked up
See my Parolee Officer almost caught me with that stuff
recession's all around
We gotta be here for each other when it hit the ground
I know your hurtin' (hurtin') and workin' (workin')
Don't give up it will all work out (work out)
