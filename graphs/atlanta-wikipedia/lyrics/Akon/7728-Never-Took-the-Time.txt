A moment ago it seemed, it was yesterday
You were here with me
And everything seems to be the same
What am I supposed to do
With all these empty rooms?
Sit here in solitude
With the smell of your perfume
You never took the time to know me
You never took the time to understand
You never took the time to know me, yeah
â€˜Cause loving you is all I ever had
Said loving you is all I ever had
