I put bezels in my wrist
I put bezel on my bitch
I iced out all my clique
Still ridin' round with that stick like a battery
Black diamonds on me but I ain't no racist
Been Trappin' out the band, but I'm not a Migo
Now I'm ballin' like Chris Paul
The broke bitches reach me, yo, nigga, we ain't the same
