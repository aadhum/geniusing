[Verse 1]
Yeah, it's about
More path than this big ol' thigh
Speak come on it
The body language, nigga
It don't lie
I just wanna beat it
She wanna a thug nigga
Show a good ol' time
Yeah, so I called the backup
Bottle of Hennessey and some good ol' wine
Cause good boys ain't no fun
And bad boys carry guns
End it up cleat, top of that shit
[Verse 2]
Them good girls lie too
Just like you do
Them bad girls show no shame
But they keep it true, aha
I fuck with you
You damn right
The things you do, aha
Good girls wanna be you
And you wanna be them too
