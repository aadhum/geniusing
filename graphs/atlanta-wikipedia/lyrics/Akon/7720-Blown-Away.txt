Konvict, Konvict, ha ha
You know where I come from
But 9 out of 10 of us ain't got good luck
You gon' ride on a man and catch 25
Or get hit and get sent to the other side
You lose both sides of the coin
9 in the groin
Momma got a little church I could join, but I ain't go yet
Man got a mosque I could join, but I ain't go yet
See, I ain't never shot nobody
But I'm known for fighting
So when I strike, man, you think you been struck by lightning
Shouldn't have to prove myself by killin' a nigga
Even a child can take a life by pullin' a trigger
They say, "Guns don't kill people, people do"
So if you see me out there with a bear and we fightin'
Nigga, then go help the bear
