[Intro: Bobby Vinton]
Lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so lonely, I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my owwnnn
I'm so lonely
Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my players out there, man
Ya know, that got that one good girl, dog
That's always been there, man
Like, took all the bullshit
Then one day she can't take it no more and decides to leave
Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin
for her I was feenin
So I had to take a little ride
Back tracking on these few years
Cause ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' and I'm so
Lonely (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely
After all I put you through
You still stuck around and stayed by my side
broke your heart
Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you would get up and run
And I would be out chasing you
Cause ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one on the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now so lonely
Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I never wished I'd ever hurt my baby
And it's drivin me crazy cause I'm so
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
Mr. Lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
So lonely, (lonely)
So lonely, (so lonely)
So lonely
Mr. Lonely
