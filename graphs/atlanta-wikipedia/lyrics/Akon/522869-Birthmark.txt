I'm falling for you
This the day it all began
One place that it came together
More than a ring or a tattoo
Wish your birthmark that reminds of you

So let's get on an airplane
Go back to where we began
To that point which is days apart
That stamp right next to your heart
To your heart, to your heart
To your heart
