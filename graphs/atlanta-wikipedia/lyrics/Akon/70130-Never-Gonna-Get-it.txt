I'm from the hard knock academy, automatically had to be
Carryin' automatics, sprayin' sporadic, inaccurate
Clips to the back of it, barrel cockin' immaculate
Learn to move packages in and out of Los Angeles
We savages, bustin' off rounds, sprayin' banana clips
Knockin pounds off 'em like Anna Nicole Smith
I'm in the hood, walkin' with choppers
I probably popped Hoffa and possibly just forgot where I tossed 'em
This nigga's obnoxious, me and Top got your bitch in the cockpit
She want a pit stop, just see how the cock spit
Chain hangin' like Ali Baba
Who in the hell left the gate open?
I put it down for the wild, wild west
Like the 1800s in 'em stage coaches
If I ain't strapped then my blade's pokin'
If it ain't a 600 big body, then the '64, honey, is spokin'
I rather be opening up my nine, then closed in my coffin
I'm from West Covina, this ain't Compton
Still money passed around like we takin' a offerin'
When they see the sad happy faces, they know the drama's on
Run up to find out I keep it loaded like bases
Get wise and your mouth and knees need braces
