Konvict, Konvict – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Go gangsta – ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
(Upfront!)
See, nowadays it seems like e'rybody wanna be killas
Gorillas getting high off their weed and liquor
You die quicker, paramedics drive back slow to the hospital
You get pronounced dead at 4, to the hospital
First nigga to retreat when the tools bustin'
Playing with death is bad for your health
All your homeboys gone, you the last one left
Now, they hearts beatin', but these niggas be scared
The real ones are all locked up or dead
Nowadays you can't find a good connect
But if you do, you might be the feds, so…
I don't know you, you don't know me
You don't know the history I got on these streets
Only if you see what my eyes have seen
Then you'll understand why I'm surrounded by G's
If you owe me, and we got beef
I recommend you reach for your heat and don't freeze
Pause for a minute, guaranteed you gon' bleed
‘Cause that's how we was raised growing up in these streets
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Rock with me, let's get this bitch poppin'
Go gangsta, keep boppin'
Like back when a nigga was clockin'
See, it's hard to be good, but easy to do evil
And I ain't really into meeting with new people
Just put the money in the bag and I'll leave you
weed
coke
Lambo
Evisu
When you coppin' O's, they swearing you move ki's
And they tryin' to find them birds
Not the ones that sleep in trees
We got that bird, we got that blue
You want short skirts? We got that too
Whatever you need, my nigga, show me the cheese
And baby, you can believe that we can make that brew
Streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet
The streets been watchin' and they don't blink
Sidewalk got ears, the pavement don't sleep
The fittest will survive, the weak just don't eat
E'rybody in between just gettin' a rap sheet
