A Sole Survivor!
Post up under them city lights and you know I got that thing on me
Ready in case they bang on me try to plug and put a blood stain on me
Cuz in the hood nigga we bubbling
We'll end up under that shoveling
Might of had to move candy but believe money I'm so sucker free
AK I load that 8K I throw that
Just like my niggas that really never made it home
Gotta put that muscle on it
Stand on the corner till the morning
9 mille hidden under the hood
