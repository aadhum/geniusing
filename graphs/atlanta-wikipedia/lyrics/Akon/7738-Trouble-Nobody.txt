Ok...Akon stay out of trouble now son
Akon... stay out of trouble now son
Let me tell you what hurts the most
I'm a convicted felon and I can't work
No matter where I go I try to get paid
They never give me the job cuz they are afraid that
I'm a stick em up oh yea stick it
Rob the manager and everybody in it
The judges said don't trouble nobody
Probation said don't trouble nobody
Stay out of trouble, don't trouble nobody
And I'm a try not to trouble nobody
I'm tryin to stay away from trouble everyday
But its hard when the things you need
Picture lookin at your babies in the face
When they hungry and they need to eat
Tryin not to do wrong
But they won't let me do right
Even though I done changed my life
Criminal records what they judgen me by
That's why..
