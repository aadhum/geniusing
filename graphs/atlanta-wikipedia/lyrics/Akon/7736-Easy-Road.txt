Could it be the feds still listening
Ain't time for the miscelleneous
And they proceed to keep on watching
Cause i've seen them lately
Interrogated my mum
Locked up half of my crew
I won't cause I came too far
God has been protecting me (protecting me)
Came too far to turn back now (too far) 2ce
Ain't nobody goin' stop me (can stop me) 2ce
Came too far to turn back now (too far) 2ce
Ain't nobody goin' stop me (can stop me) 2ce
