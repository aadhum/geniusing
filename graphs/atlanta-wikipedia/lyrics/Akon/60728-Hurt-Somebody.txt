This concrete is too cold, to be walking on it
Or else walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle, oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I’ve been living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
Before I hurt somebody
Or I have to hurt somebody
My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Pairs
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because
You got the biggest gun, I hope it’s for protection
