It’s a dirty job but somebody’s gotta do it
Baby I’mma watch… you, just keep it moving
You know exactly what you’re doing
So go and do your dirty work
Go and do your dirty work
Ass up
Face down
Asking dumb questions like “baby, do you model?”
Isn’t she the most beautiful thing that you ever saw?
Don’t she deserve the biggest diamond ring that you ever bought?
Shake down
Just wanna love you without looking' like a clown
You’re killing everybody, how're you supposed to make a living?
Yes I know you hear it all when they trickin'
I can hear them niggas saying you too pretty to be strippin'
More money, more problems,
‘Cause you know all my favourite features
You can call me Young Khalifa
