Hey ladies drop it down
Just want to see you touch the ground
Don't be shy girl go Banaza
Shake ya body like a belly dancer
Yo, excuse me, beg your pardon girl
Do you have any idea what you starting girl
You got me tingiling, come to me mingiling
Steppin off lookin bootylicious and jingiling
When you walk, I see you baby girl
When you talk, I believe
Love to work the kitty like purrrr
Get you excited and call her boyfriend up (ohh)
So stand by like a butty pass
Slide it ova to Bu cause he wants some too
