[Verse 1]
I'm sittin' on my porch, watching the law
As they ride past in they patrol cars
So tell me why I feel like the enemy
They're supposed to be here protectin' me
I might have went too far
Helping to contribute to making they job hard
Serving fiends like these people ain't no enemy
I can't believe I'm out here killing my community
Don't want it, you can tell by the look at me
This gangsta life ain't no longer in me
