{"I can't wait."}
When the morning comes and the nighttime goes away
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin' you
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me
{"I can't wait."} Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
{"I can't wait."} Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}
