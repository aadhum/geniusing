This Big Meech from the richest black muthafucking gang in the world
My nigga always say, there's only two things a nigga can do for you
You either got time or money, can't have em both
Nigga with money, ain't got no time
Nigga with time, ain't got no money
We don't have a lot of time around here
Why you focused on all this dealing?
When niggas coming in through the back door stealing?
Crib on the hill: now that's good living
Say you getting money but you ain't even tipping
A big-booty girl in front of you dipping
Went live in one year, made millions
Ain't got no time: it's some bad feelings
Especially when you want a little sexual healing
Girlfriend's pulling, family's pulling
In every direction, everybody need money
My lifestyle redefine how y'all living
If you keep it up I'll be broke in a minute
If I ain't got a 9 to 5 I'mma still get it
Even if I gotta live a life of crime
no matter how much money you make
None of that shit will really buy you time
