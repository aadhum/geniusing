It won't be long
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you, tell you what's been on my mind
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
And we showed
Ourselves that night, even said somethings weren't true
Why'd you go?
And haven't seen my girl since then
Cause you were my Homie, lover, and friend...
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
Till I get you back I'm gon' try, [ yes I miss you much ]
Cuz you are the apple of my eye, [ girl I miss you much ]
I can't lie, [ I miss you much ]
Watching everyday that goes by, [ I miss you much ]
Till I get you back I'm gon' try, [ yes I miss you much ]
Cuz you are the apple of my eye. [ girl I miss you much ]
want you to fly with me, [ want you to fly ]
I miss how you lie with me, [ ohh miss how you lie ]
Just wish you could dine with me, [ wish you could dine ]
The one that'll grind with me. [ ohh the one that'll grind]...
