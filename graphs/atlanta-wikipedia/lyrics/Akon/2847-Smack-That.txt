Shady
Konvict
Upfront
I feel you creepin'
I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick
Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Upfront style, ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'Lac down
Konvict's got the whole thing packed now
I'm gonna call her, than I put the mack down
I feel you creepin'
I can see you from my shadow
Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Ooh, looks like another club banger
Get a lil' drink on, they gon' flip for this Akon shit
Pedicure, manicure, kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Lookin' like one of them Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my drawers
Creeps up behind me, she's like "YOU'RE â€”"
I'm like, "Yeah, I know,
let's cut to the chase"
No time to waste, back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace,
shall I say
And plus I got a pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singin' the song that's playin' (Akon!)
I feel you creepin'
I can you see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like TaeBo
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
Eminem is rollin', D and 'em rollin'
Bo and all marvelous them rollin'
Women just hoein', big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be all in them and throwin' D
Hittin' no less than three
I feel you creepin'
I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place
And just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over
Look back and watch me
Smack that, all on the floor
Smack that, give me some more
