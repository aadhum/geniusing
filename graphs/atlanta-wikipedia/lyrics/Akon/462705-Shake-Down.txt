Stand up
Salute
DeVyne Stevens
Up front is in the building
It's the Konvict album
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them gats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down
A fleet of European cars in my driveway
Murcielago, Gallardo, Ferrari
Bumping sadie
Ya know I got that African connection
Locked up in a facility correction
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them gats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down
Hey now
A bunch of gangstas strapped
So make a wish now
When they come wavin' them gats
Ya know to lay down
And give em all ya got
Cause it's a shake down
