One hundred if you real, dawg
This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city
Never said a word to the police
Same nigga I start with, out the gutter, ate garbage
Same niggas I bought cars with, shrimp, steak, and ate marvelous
And while you playin' ball, tryna D up
I had a dream that I'd be rich, call that Martin Lutin'
choppers
