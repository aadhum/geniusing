The pressure's buildin up (oh) I feel like givin up (oh)
How in the fuck am I gonna back my first album up?
Well everything has changed (oh) it'll never be the same (oh)
It's no different, every day it's just the same thing
Now it's been months out on the road
On tour doin so many different shows
Head spinnin feelin like it's gonna explode
And I just wanna know
If anybody out there's feelin me
I'm losin my mind and I can't believe
I let this shit get the best of me
Look in the mirror, my reflection looks different now
It's all over but - I can't escape the raaaaain
