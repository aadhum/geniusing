Locked up, they won't let me out
And I had a long day in court, shit stress me out
Won't give me a bill, they can't get me out
Now I'm heading to the County, gotta do a bid there
I used to living luxurious, I don't wanna live here
The walls is gray, the clothes is orange
The phones is broke, the food is garbage
Lotta niggas is living with these circumstances
Knock me on D-Block when I was burnin' the hemp
Had a brick in the stash
Hope they don't take it to a further extent
I'm steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what I do?
The freedom ain't getting no closer
No matter how far I go
My car is stolen, no registration
The cops patrollin'
And now they done stopped me
And I get locked up
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
Heading up town to re-up
Back with a couple ki's
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Product's moving fast
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
Now that I'm locked up I rep two sets so
I'ma Ryde or Die and stay D-Blocked up
Two toothbrushes up, whoever want it with P
Go and hit the bar when the wrecks be out
They won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up; they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
They won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
No, they won't let me out
