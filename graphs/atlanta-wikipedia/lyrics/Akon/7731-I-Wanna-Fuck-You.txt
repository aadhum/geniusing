Konvict… Konvict… Konvict
Konvict… Muzik
And you know we up front
I see you winding and grinding up on that pole
I know you see me looking at you and you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know
I wanna fuck you, fuck you, you already know, girl
[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Money in the air
ho sale
don't tell, won't tell
Baby said I don't talk, Dogg, but she told on me, oh well
D-O-double G
and I'm here to put this dick on you
I'm stuck on pussy and yours is right
and them doors is tight
‘Cause pussy is pussy and, baby, you're pussy for life
[Hook: Akon]
Shorty, I can see, you ain't lonely
Handful of niggas and they all got cheese
Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spending a couple dubs
Throwing bout 30 stacks in the back
Make it rain like that ‘cause I'm far from a scrub
And you know my pedigree
Ex-dealer use to move 'phetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothin'
And besides, I got a thing for you
[Hook: Akon]
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoking section (Just smoking)
Your titties is bouncin' (Yeah)
Baby, you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
[Hook: Akon 2x]
