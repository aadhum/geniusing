My nigga, I’m a beast!
I can go thirty days and nights with no sleep
Like the mice in the streets
The only meal that I see every day is my cheese
I don’t think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don’t think you can keep up
Keep up, hey, keep up, hey!
I don’t think you can keep up!
Cause when I’m riding in your lane, getting it poppin simple and plain
Konvict model
I’m watching all these haters getting close to my fame
Only if they know what it takes to maintain
i
l
y
Used to hang out on the curb
Now I’m living lavish in the 'burbs
Women used to never pay attention when I flirt
Now they see me out in public, steady ripping up my shirt
No longer sitting in the coupe handing out birds
Conditioned by the slums and raised by the streets
And if you’re as hard as steel, then you and I will collide, yeah
We gon' rush at each other like two rams fighting in the grass land, yeah!
And i’ma be the last man standing!
