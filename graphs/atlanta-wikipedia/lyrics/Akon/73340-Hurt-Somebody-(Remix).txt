My mama need a crib, son need some Jordan’s
Band’s listening and the band record it
Trying to flush the pen hoping I survive the morning
It’s getting hot-hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Want her on the block? Then you got to put your work in
Smoked got my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Never judge me before you judge yourself
