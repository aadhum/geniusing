Another day up in the hood can't believe these cats still bangin
All my dawgs got guns ready for action, they won't betray me
Ain't the type to run or to hold my tongue when it gets crazy
See I been through this type of thang before
Even had trouble with the law
On the couch when they smashed my door
Drivin somethin, pronounced mad strange
