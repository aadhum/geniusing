Money to blow so I'm ridin 'round with that Nina (ride 'round with that Nina)
With a Hollywood ho with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya? (how can I meet ya?)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
My diamonds talk for me they say how can I meet ya?
I got t-pain around my wrist, Gaga around my neck
Got o' money so long, I ain't movin' cash in them checks
I keep wide 3's on my feet
still ridin' 'round with that heat
Foreign cars in my garage, all these bad bitches I beat
Oops! Ridin' 'round, gettin' head from a girl named Nina
Oops! I'm sorry, but I'm on my Ike and Tina (Ike and Tina)
I'm African so you know I got hyenas
I cashed out on my whips, I cashed out from my check
TV again, got that stations all in my bed
Got a indoor court, outdoor court
Indoor pool, outdoor pool
I ain't lyin', nigga tell it's true
Ask Ray he done be there too
With a Hollywood ho with lips like Angelina (lips like Angelina)
Got an island on my wrist, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Got an island on my neck, girl, I'm cashin' out (I'm cashin' out)
Ok, I drop the top, hop in
Hoes they coming by flocks in
Birds they coming by flocks in
Pass them birds like Stockton
Play with my money I'm popping
Got Spinz on the beat so we ain't losing
Don't act like your ho ain't choosin
I done blowed up, yeah I'm the bomb
Riding round blowing on stank bombs
Top floor suite chilling at the Palms
We want the whole loaf leave y'all the crumbs
Til then I'm running my check up
And it's fuck a Bugatti I'm calling my jet up
36 O's ho riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
Time to cop the Maybach already had the vert
I got big money visions, Sammy Sosa pigeons
What that mean? That mean they jumping out the kitchen
And you can skate on my ice just like you playing hockey
And in the booth I beat the beat up, call me Rocky
Yeah I'm cocky
36 O's ho riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
Got a condo on my wrist girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck girl, I'm cashing out
36 O's so I'm riding round with that nina
