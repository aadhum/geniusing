Every evening you will find him around our neighborhood
It's the old dope peddler doing well by doing good
(Shawty get them kids out the street!)
I said I pull up to that club like motherfucking ho you don't know me
Most of my niggas got gold teeth
Most of my bitches got tattoos
Most of my niggas think cash rules
And I mess up hairdo's like it's a pair of shoes
(Let me take my shades off a little (...) See what these bitches looking like!)
See what these bitches looking like
Stick in all crooked like
Louie V is my Kryptonite
Chrisette Michele
Way I'm running shit man I should have a shoe deal
Pockets on Fatburger
Going so hard you'd think I mixed a Viagra with a Soda
Staying focused, this yola here
Black and white ice: polar bear
You hold her hand and I hold her hair
When the shades of night are falling
Comes a fellow everyone knows
It's the old dope peddler spreading joy wherever he goes
