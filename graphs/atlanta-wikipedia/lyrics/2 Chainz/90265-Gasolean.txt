See I be rocking Truey and my belt by Louis
I hope that ain't your girl cause I know you seen her choosin'
See I be rocking Truey and my belt by Louis
Yeah, I'm on that gas,
and yeah, I'm on that lean
We mix it all together and we call it gasolean
I say first I hit the gas then I lean
First I hit the gas then I lean [x3]
First I hit the gas turn it up and make it smash
Hit them with they Keith Sweat cause I'm a make it last
Put some shoes on that bitch count money till I get arthritis
And my belt by Louis, and your girlfriend shoes
And keep your eyes on the road before you crash like a computer
Yeah my name is 2 Chainz I'm about to put on two more
I don't love them hoes,
don't play me know I'm like
Everyday VIP the way I draw the lines
It's cold in the booth, I should rap in a snow suit
Ninety three octane got me gassed up
Hit it with the codeine dick now I'm assed up
