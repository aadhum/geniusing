I walk in the rain
Still won't get wet
Started with a nick and got a 62
my planets were digable
It's an amber alert I gotta missing roof
you are what you eat but I am not a pussy
Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper
Started from the bottom now we at the top
Graduated from high school and bought a choppa
Orville Redenbacher bitch we got it poppin on the block
With that white girl, Cindy Lauper
When they saw me they used to think of dope
But now when they see me they just think of hope
Hand full of ones pocket full of Hunn
If I was sellin swag man I woulda sold a ton
Designer sneaks leather seats
Big ass charm conversation peice
[Verse 3: Dolla Boy]
