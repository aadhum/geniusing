That’s how many ounces in a brick
36, 36, 36, 36
That’s how many ounces in a brick

I might whip your bitch if she ain’t with that shit
Young whippersnapper, I might eat that snapper
Got a yellow bitch, gotta whip to match her
All I know is soda bakin’, all them other niggas fakin’
Did it for my city sellin’ crack out my building
Now I ride around with a crack in the ceiling
Exhale, Ziplock, flip-flop with them burglar doors
Yeah, I got that hard work, nigga, you are unemployed
just made a mill
So you know that’s what I’m hungry for,
get it how you live
