I be ridin' through the park like I'm A-Rod
Walkin' through the park like I'm A-Rod
Smokin' on that strong, that's that steroid
They tryna kick me out like A-Rod
I used to run the base like A-Rod
When I get me a check, niggas gotta respect it
I earned all my stripes like A-Rod,
worth 25 mill
Que pasa, que pasa, you know that I'm proper, I run with my partners
I just said that shit with my eyes closed
I can count a hundred thousand while I'm blindfolded
CUI, nigga, mean the chopper under influence
dreads hangin' under my A hat
If I got sucked by a teller, I would never tell you but that would be Bankhead
A1 nigga from the south side
I need a chinchilla, before I get frostbite
Put the white girl in the middle, call it Klondike
Take her the to the room after dinner, and fuck her like it's prom night
Move around my town like A-Rod
When I get that check, I'mma call Madonna
Call up Cameron Diaz, call up Daisy Fuentes
Dikembe on them hoes like no-no, not in my house, you can't stay
God dammit, I done came up, nigga
Breakin' up the rock, Dame Dash
Playin' with the base like A-Rod
Playin' with them M's since yay high
Mix it up, drink it, stay high
