This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
Money tall, Tyra Banks
Couldn’t believe in Santa Claus ‘cause I ain’t have no chimney
Soufside with a F and the F for Fendi
Had two SS’s like Mississippi
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
And all my woes is athletic
Leather soft, you niggas softer
What’s that smell? Rigor mortis
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
This the shit you play when you in a Bentley truck
This the shit you play when you smoke a zip and up
This the shit you play when you sippin’ out a cup
