Diamonds talking back, they say "fuck y'all"
Rock Givenchy shoes like they All-Star
Crib the same size as the Walmart
Yard so big I got a golf cart
Diamonds on me dancing like it's Breezy
buy
I just got a call from Jeezy
ink on my body, graffiti
And you know I come from CP
Can't fuck no bitch with no VD, nah
Ain't wore the same shoes the whole month now
Mr. Chow
Bitches bi, they liking girls and guys
winterized
When I die bury me beside the Cuban links
a lot of Z's 'cause you niggas sleep
Rings so big you could go boxing
Diamonds talking back, yours ain't saying nothing
