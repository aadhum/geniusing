Okay you know that I'm illy,
And I got acres, I never met my neighbors
Got her on the D and I ain't talkin' 'bout Decatur
This that yellow paper, yeah I'm talkin' murder
See I'ma dog, come in your yard and take a shit
I'm the man
Would you believe it?
Dreads underneath my skully, name brand on my skully
Still sippin' on that muddy,
Niggas gon' leave here buried,
A nigga start tryna fuck with me, a nigga gon' leave here early
I pull a titty out like eject
might shoot a nigga right in the v-neck
