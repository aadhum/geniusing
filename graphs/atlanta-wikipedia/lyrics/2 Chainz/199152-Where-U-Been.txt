I keep my hoes in check, you buy Nike for yours
Say they want that loud, I'mma bring that noise
Check my watch on a flight, yeah, I call that airtime
Murk 'em in the middle of the street, that gon' be his deadline
Yeah, you gon' respect mine, got a body on my Tec-9
Say you nobody 'till somebody gon' body you, flatline
Pocket full of dead guys
and you know I'm anti
Anti-social, anti-lame, but ain't I cool nigga, ain't I?
You looking at a star that's spaced out
Trying to take my style then take off
I go to work with no days off, everything all paid off
Shawty pussy hair shaved off and she did it just for me, nigga
Would skip you like a spacebar, but I much rather delete niggas
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?
Gucci hat (Gucci hat), Gucci belt
If you wrote a autobiography, you'd have to sue yourself
Yo' lying ass,
codeine in my wine glass
I get high and I fly past,
I'm working this iPhone, they need an app called iTrap
White cup, white hat, laying on a white couch
Got that presidential in a residential white house
Nigga saying "who?" (who) like a white owl
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?
Turn five to a ten to a twenty to fifty
To hundred, my niggas get money, I want it
Ride through the city, my niggas got choppers
Run up a check while they watch out for police
a brick on my Rollie
That Cali Ferrari, I'm feeling like Kobe
T-R-U, that's to the death of me, nigga
I can't, I can't share that whole recipe with ya
That .40 got hollows, that bitch, she gon' swallow
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting money, where the fuck you been?
I been getting to the money, where the fuck you been?
