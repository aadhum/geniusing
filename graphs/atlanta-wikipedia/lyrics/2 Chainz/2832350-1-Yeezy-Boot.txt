Gon' make me take a shot of, gon' make me take a shot of apple Crown. Ain't no apple Crown? Uh Cap, that's all Cap
Where I come from, my bedroom was real little
Now I'm mansion status,
When they bring my check, I start cabbage patchin'
When she look down, I know that's chain reaction
Introduce me to your nigga, I had a lame reaction
Had me all itchin' and shit
