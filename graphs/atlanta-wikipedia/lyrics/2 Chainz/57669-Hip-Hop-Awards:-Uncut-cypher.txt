What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Hair weave killa I’ll show up to your funeral
Different color diamonds like a rubrics cube
If this was New Edition, I’ll be Bobby Brown.
Free Boosie, wipe me down.
My credit card is black and proud
I’m going to the money and I took the paper route
Uh Yeh, I’m hood approved and I’m street tested. You a nobody; anorexic
If you stay next to me you’re close to a blessing
They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse
I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma
