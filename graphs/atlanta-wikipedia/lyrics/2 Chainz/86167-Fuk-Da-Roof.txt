(Okay) Free Tunechi, Yeah
2 Chainz! Hey, Hey, Hey
I got a bad bitch, she more than cute
And bitch I'm balling, I'm talking more than hoops
This is that fish scale, nigga we water-proof
I got into it with my car and I said fuck the roof
I'm in my black car chilling with my yellow ho (Yellow ho)
It's a two seater but it's known to carry fo'(Okay)
And I got four zips off in my Styrofoam
We the two gun gang nigga, uncaged
sharpay
And I bought my yellow bitch a mustang (Get out of here)
Long hair, nigga no fade
I'm blowing smoke in here, tell me where's Smokey Bear
They say I look like a chimney when I'm on the chair
Yellow ice caution, I'm cautious, yield
Twenty-eight inches make this bitch levitate
