I am smokin' on that gas,
life should be on Cinemax
Movie,
bought my boo bigger tits and a bigger ass
I smoke strong; that Popeye
black diamonds; apartheid
Bread up and my top down,
Dope enough to go in yo' nostrils
I take your girl and kidnap her, feed her to my mattress
Got your car note in my cup,
and your rent in my Swisher
And all I get is cheese, like I’m takin' pictures
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?
2 Chainz and Champagne
You want true, that’s true enough
Forbes list like every year,
my office is my tour bus
She came through, she brought food
She got fucked, she knew whassup
Aww, that look like what’s her name
Chances are it’s what's her name
Chances are if she was acting up
Then I fucked her once and never fucked again
She could have a Grammy
I still treat her ass like a nominee
Just need to know what that pussy like
So one time is fine with me
Young as an intern, but money like I built the shit
Streets talkin', they'll confirm
Go ask them who just killed the shit
So I’m extra charged like a state tax
Me and Chainz go way back
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?
Name a nigga that want some
I’ll out-rap his ass, out-trap his ass
Put his ass in a plastic bag with his trashy ass
Take him out, bring 'em in, them whole things
2Pac without a nose ring
Thug Life,
one wife, a mistress and a girlfriend
(Tru!)
YSL belt buckle,
y’all niggas sure is lookin'
Y’all niggas sure is lucky,
two chains on my rugby
Left hand on that steering wheel,
right hand on that pussy
I say fuck you, 'less I’m with ya
If I take you out of the picture
I know real niggas won't miss ya
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
No lie, no lie, no lie-ee-i-ee-i
That's a thing I don’t do
Nah, I just do it for the niggas
That are tryna see a million 'fore they die
Whattup?
