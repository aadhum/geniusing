I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
I wear Versace like it's Nike, you don't like it do you
I bet you feel this bankroll if I bump into you, oh yeah
Chopper bullets flying errywhere, got them chopper bullets flying errywhere
.223 chopper clip
as long as Stacey Augmon.
I order 2 fried lobsters
Napkin on my Balmains, smokin' with lil mama
Sprinter van on me
I got them Zans on me
Driveway so damn long by the time I leave I'm damn asleep
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
I done put so many on I can't fall off
Trying to see how much the West End Mall costs
I might buy a Maybach and paint it all gold
Buy a crib fill the rooms up with all stoves
drop the top off the whip, hair-line receding
Rims on the car make it six feet, so I can park the car wherever the blimps be
I drink syrup with no pancakes
Yeah, bitches round my pool, I make them hoe look like my landscape
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr
I'm the king of the trap, El Chapo Jr
Anywhere on the map, I bring it to you
El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, El Chapo Jr, I'ma bring it to ya
