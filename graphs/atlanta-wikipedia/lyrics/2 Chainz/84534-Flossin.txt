I came in a porche
I came in to floss
I got a phone full of dimes
I don’t know which one to call oh
I just know I wanna floss
I don’t know if I should cheat
‘Cause I love my nina rose yeah
Dem niggas acting dirty
We gon’ take ‘em to the cleaners
In a beamer with Sabrina
A daddy got the refill baby
Daddy in the chain game
He got it out in december
Making niggas see my view Whoopi Goldberg
How could I get caught over if I had a chauffeur,over
Treat the backseat like a couch
I’m in love with the bitch we clicking like a lighter
Take her everywhere I go because I’m not tryna fight you
