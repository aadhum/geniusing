In the fastline, I move him over to the right side
Mama's only child, the crack house was my daycare
Kenmore stove money
Everythin' I did in the past was intellectual
Now it's Mr. Gimme-your-section-with-a-extra-booth
Show you what the extra do
Want a four door, so I bought me an extra coupe
One for me, one for me, really ain't no effort to it
Mr. Impeccable, turn you to a vegetable,
fuck her on the sectional
Pull on her hair while she's lickin' on the testicles
Aimin' for the stars, so I fucked her on the balcony
Laid on the floor and I made your hoe come vacuum me
