All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
All my niggas A1
All got street cred
All my niggas ballin'
All my niggas athletic
Pulled up in the Phantom
Pulled off with a dancer
Got a pocket full of money
Kinda hard to keep my pants up
Lil Quay fucked the Xans up
Kinda hard to understand us
Duffle bags in the Escalade
Call the bitch there a bread truck
Got the bitch going retarded
Call Uber for a spare truck
All these niggas never scared us
All these niggas never ran up
Bitch tryna put the head on me
Niggas tryna put the feds on me
Niggas tryna take meds on me
Everything for the players only
Niggas sunny like Arizona
Gunshots just for sayin' something
Spraying shit like aerosol
You a foul and that's a fair ball
Nigga can't reach the goals
Keep shootin' a damn air ball
My partners still smoke on parole
They say that I'm crazy
I used to talk to a stove
Go to the dealership, fishtail off the lot
You know I'm comin' straight out the block
You know I'm comin' straight out the top
Shawty said she want 5 million
'Cause I told her to leave and call her a thot
Shit, you can like it or not, damn
Still got some ACT in my stock
You wavin' that thing in the sky
We wavin' that thing at your body
We wavin' that thing at your eye
Told that lil bitch I'll pass
Nigga watch the assist
I run the trap like the marathon
You know what it's like when the feelin' gone
I know what it's like when the ceilin' gone
I had a sit down with Farrakhan
Turn the White House to the Terror Dome
I used to serve at the Chevron
I used to serve with my necklace on, bitch
