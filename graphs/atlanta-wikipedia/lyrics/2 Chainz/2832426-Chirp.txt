I got Bloods in Savannah
I got Crips on Old National
Pinky ring on Alaska
Illest nigga in Nebraska
Six Flags, lotta rides
Turn the beat to a homicide
I'm doin' 75 on the 75
85 off of 85
200 on 285
None of my cars take 89
Stash spot is my boxer shorts
Weed smellin' like underarm
Turn you suckers into bubblegum
Try to take my style, nigga, brr brr
Try to take my bitch, nigga, brr brr
Damn, try to take my swag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to take my bag, nigga, brr brr
Yeah, try to hit my gas, nigga, brr brr
Thumbin' through the cash, nigga, brr brr
Thousand dollar pants, nigga, brr brr
Shit, try to take my dance, nigga, brr brr
