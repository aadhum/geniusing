If Puerto Rico wasn't gone he would be right here with me
If True wasn't gone he would be right here with me
And free all my niggas tryna get some guap
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
We some street niggas, we got next, bitch
Gucci my feet too
I got Cuban on my links
I might pull up in a Brinks
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
Concrete damn floor
I Golden State the schedule
It got a hole in the ceiling
Shawty sucked mine so damn long, I got a hickey
She step in blood when she walk
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
I'm tryna drop some babies in her jawbone
