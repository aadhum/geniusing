I said I take care of my kids but I'm flexin' on my baby mama
I'm like, "Damn, I shoulda wore a condom!"
My shoes sold out in one day
In a Maybach, pockets stay fat
shoot barrel long range
breakfast time I might sea food it
Lunch time I might lamb chop it
smokin' on that propane
I could tell ya ass one thing, I like gettin' head wearing both chains
I been trappin' fore the Grammy nods
I been countin' money so long I'mma need a damn hand massage
So many cars, I can barely park
So many cars, I need another damn garage
I'm famous with my fam around,
damn I wish I had my dad around
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Aye, European style my dresscode,
Walk around with a .36
with six shots in my .38 Special
black Timbs
I'm the rap Ernie Barnes
firearms
Viacom
if she bad I invite her home
Rims taller than Kevin Hart, Ride Along
I ain't hidin' so you ain't gotta find me, nigga
Came in rockin' all gold
Smokin' on that Lee Haney,
sippin' on that hard boiled
This that get back - click clack, get back
Smokin' on Raw paper, this ain't zig zags
Snakeskin wallpaper, rose gold chandelier
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
Watch how I'mma kill em for the summer
(Watch how I kill 'em)
