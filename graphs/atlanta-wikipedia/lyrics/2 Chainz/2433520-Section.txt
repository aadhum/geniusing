You niggas ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
You niggas ain't talking about nothing what the fuck y'all doing in my section
Stunna
My favorite rapper is me
I got them commas on commas
I went to jail, I might go to Hell, I used to sell drugs to my momma
I got a scale, I'm ducking from 12, eat Benihana’s like McDonald's
Fuck my girl with no protection
I got the loud of course
Shawty said she wanted Houston's, so I flew her to Texas
I got a selection in my collection
My favorite rapper is me
I walk around my house with a lean mug
And then the bitch swallow all of these cubs
Shoot first then I ask questions later
Nigga mad when I get no response
Been had hoes since peach fuzz
Been had money since peach fuzz
I got that money, money’s not a problem
How you like my Spanish, money’s no problemo
Smoking that loud I know you want to shoosh me
