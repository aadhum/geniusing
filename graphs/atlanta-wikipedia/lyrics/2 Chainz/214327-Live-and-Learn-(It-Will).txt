So many watches, I need a time capsule
Graduated from the streets, that's beyond tassel
I'm raw, using all caps
I got A on my ballcaps
No, I didn't do it but I thought about it
If I would have did it, it would have chalk around it
Yellow tape, never hesitate
2 Chainz derived from Section 8
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Live long enough, it'll happen to you
Live long
It will, it will
It will, it will
Then he turned around and died on me
Oh yeah, I'm God's son
Tell Nas he got more than one
I'm so ill I need penicill
Rockin' ice cubes, talkin' kill at will
And these days, you can't tell who is really real
Ridin' on some Emmitt Smith's, long way from Emmett Till
Death of a dynasty
I'm talkin' major, not the minor league
And you the last of a dyin' breed
Follow caine like a menace to society
The richest nigga in the city cosignin' me
My shampoo days done showed me the way
As I pray, lord willin' but the killer's still vague
And everything I see is adding up to what you told me
Death before dishonor
