Here I go, here I go this that C5
Bitch I’m back, with that crack like panty lines
Asinine, I get blow like dandelions
Fuck more hoes than advertised
They say Tune you’re dead wrong
I say wrong, had to die
Pussy nigga don’t keep it real no more
Drug dealers changed but the high stay the same
Prices go up but the high stay the same
Gotta watch for undercovers like crying in the rain
I just cut off the lights, hope I don’t shoot my hoe
I eat so much shrimp, I smoke so much hemp
The world too small it feel like 4 walls
You see I got holes punched in
My chances are cold cut thin, but I still took ‘em and nigga we made it
T roll that killer, weed up in the swisher, and make it as fat as a pig in a blanket
My BFF is Benjamin Franklin
they cry for help we get ‘em a hanky
Niggas is assholes, or enemas, finna get anal
I throw niggas from off of the plane I’m in
Oh my god, it’s raining men
Said the weatherman to the anchorman
Cold hearted, starting to feel like I’m in Anchorage when I think of this
Bitch I smell like money, dope man cologne
I say bitch I smell like money, that’s that dope man cologne
When you this rich they call it wealthy
Shit they gotta call it somethin’
Lord I done got too rich for stuntin’
Totin’ double barrels in a horse and carriage
Ain’t scared of nothing except God and marriage
Through the concrete grew a rose petal
If trapping was a sport, I’d have a gold medal
I steal her like Jerome Bettis
Call me Trill Cosby, I might spike my own beverage
Parallel park in front of Neiman Marcus
He ain’t never fly nigga, like an ostrich
Might have a swag contest and give out free Versaces
Yea, lobster rolls for an appetizer
Bad red bitch give me a lap-etizer
Codeines, Xanax and liquor
Prescriptions and couple pistols
Got clean molly with the crystals
Middle finger to the judicials
Fork and a pot is my utensils
Had a threesome with 2 sisters
I get head and you kiss her
I got every gun except a missile
Only child with trust issues
Last night I prayed to God and asked for him to make a drop truck
Polo T and ice watch, moccasins without socks
