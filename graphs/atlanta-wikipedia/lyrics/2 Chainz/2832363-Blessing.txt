I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
I'm a blessing, I'm a blessing
If I know you, I'ma bless you
You my folks, I'ma bless you
If I love you, I'ma bless you
If I trust you, it's a blessing
If you flexin', then it's a blessing
And if they test you, then it's a blessing
When I'm alone in my room, sometimes it look like the mall
I done bought at least two chains more than twice
Count money from the night 'til the mornin' light
My partner bought so much pussy, man they gave that boy a discount
paid so
I just dropped the top on the whip, I'm in fuego
Ate a caesar salad, I dropped carats in my salad
Pocket full of money, nothin' less than a 50, yeah
