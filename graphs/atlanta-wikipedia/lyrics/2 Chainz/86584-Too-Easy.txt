Call me Tity Boi you can call me 2 Chainz
Fire, fire, fire, let them feel the gat
Nigga four Os nigga throw like a quarterback
Just got dressed I'm colder than the flu season
Menage a trois and I dont change the rubbers
Nasty nigga so dont ask a nigga
Black and ashy flashy with charisma
A pack of cigarillos and 2 liter
And that's just for two people
Trynna get numb nigga cuz my feelings hurt
Dealing work I'm a go to jail I keep killing verses
I got a hard top I'm about to convert
Name brand head to toe walking in strokers
I say its too easy me and two Breezys
Pack of bitches trynna make a movie for the final edit
That paper stacking like Kinkos
Me and 2 Chainz go too nuts
Louie V got Damier
