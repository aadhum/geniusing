I got extra, I got extra
I got money,
I get money,
Fucked your girl on accident, that's a hit-and-run
I pray for all my niggas with a federal case, damn
Southside, I got all this
Snake skin on my hat, albino
I'm rich, like Lionel,
I get head like rhino
I just went on the run, 100 piece for a show
Last name Chainz, first name 2
Put it in her tummy, pu-put it in her tummy
Hit her with the morning dick, ooh, I ain't pissed yet
Yeah, I rep the A, the only thing I flunk is piss tests
Okay, I'm rich, like Homie
Used to have a little room, now that's a house and an acre
If I get her in the room, she gon' suck my babies
If you owe me money then, real soon, you better pay me
Me and 2 Chainz just like shoe strings, strapped like laces
boy, I'm a star like Macy's
And I got your main dame, yeah, the one you call your lady
First million dollars, most important thing: saving
