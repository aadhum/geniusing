Okay, so I got the ambiance just where I want it (yeah)
My ego is enormous like my crib in California
Now I said I'm from the corner of the ATL
I held Glocks, sold rocks by the mailbox (ooh)
Gas in a Ziploc, now that's loud and clear
This one outta here, this is our year
Pussy tight
Maybe I'll spend the night, yeah, yeah
That's a vibe
Bust it, bust it wide
This the type of shit I like, yeah, yeah
