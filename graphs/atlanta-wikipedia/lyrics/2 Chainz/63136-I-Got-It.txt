The only way to come up is to stay down, A-Town
The world is my playground
your girl wanna play round
Knock that P off now your girl wanna lay round
Hair weave killa, mix it with a Trey hook
facebook
vodka proof
Damn, I got them chickens nigga cock-a-doodle-doo
I got the flu, I need lobster noodle soup
I got weight I'm tryna lose a hundred pounds
So much swag, "swag" could be my adlib
I'm in the drop I shoulda brought the top with me
I gotta go to court I keep killin stages
Now I'm headed to the top, call it elevation
The only nigga in first class
Still got last night on my mustache
Hit em with the louie belt and louie on my foot
Ten racks on me I don't need no wallet
I'mma throw it all don't need no pockets
Got my loose change putin hoes through college
Like I ate some bad pizza and I'm bout to throw some dough up
Haha, you bout to blow up
Nigga you bout to blow up
