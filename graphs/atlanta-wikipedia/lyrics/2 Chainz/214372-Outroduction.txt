I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
I'm blessed, some might say I'm lucky
pockets on husky
If you look at my pockets you a weight watcher
From a dishwasher to a kingpin
Remember how the scene end and how this thing is
Two kids later, I mature like fine wine in the basement
Vino, different kind of pinot
I'm tryna make it count like a free throw at the free throw
Line, it's a thin one between
Getting high and committing crimes
I've been locked up more rapping than I did tryna get a brick
I'm the illest, I wrote that shit in cursive too
And I smoke just to ease the pain
So hungry I used to try to eat the rain
He called to tell me happy new years
I had to tell him nigga, it's March
They had dough and we didn't
How did it dissolve, alka-seltzer
This is the outroduction
Niggas stab you in your back like acupuncture
