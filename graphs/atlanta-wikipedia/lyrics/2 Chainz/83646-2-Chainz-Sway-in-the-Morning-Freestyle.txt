My rhyme style real nonchalant
Trust me rude boy ain't what you want
Hit your ass up have you doing somersaults
Then I drop your trashy ass off in the
Every week I get my car washed
Slap a little ass recording
I'm from the south but im smoking on that
I let my girl wash clothes on the G4 so I can let the jet dry
I'm the best I know this
And you ain't even notice
Until I rode up on you
Like fuck it im focused
Im fucking with bitches thats only fucking with soldiers
I got a old school the color of Okra
The tires as wide as Oprah
Watching it when its approaching
Peace up
A-Town down
You know I got that piece up
so I won't play around
2chain!
