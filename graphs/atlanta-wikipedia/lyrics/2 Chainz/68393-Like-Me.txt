[Hook: The Weeknd]
Girl, I'm just a bird
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me
Girl, I'm just a bird
Don't make me make you fall in love
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me
Girl, I'm just a bird
I'm just another bird
Don't make me make you fall in love with a nigga like me, like me
all I need is one lighter
So cold I frostbite 'em,
On top, from the back, I thundercat like (HOE!)
Mustard, ketchup, I take pills, expert
And now I got me a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch, who got a bad bitch
2 Chainz and Tity Boi
Nigga thatâ€™s 2 stories, who want it?
