Drumma boy (Drumma boy)
I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word
Niggas know I call my Porsche the baby elephant
You ain't talking money then you got speech impediment
And I done sold a 9 at least 9 times
9 Milla, clientele Look Like Thriller
My Penny loafers had nickels... UGH
I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
Everything that I got I got from slanging birds
That's my motherfuckin word nigga
That's my word
I'm slangin Chickens
I'm slangin Hawks
I Take The 4 up out of the brick bitch I can write in chalk
You know I know that white and green like a chalk board
What you doing? Just chillin look like the top bored
So many chickens in the kitchen it looks like a soup
This for my niggas cooking 9s like they chicken breasts
No, I ain't tripping
Put the pigeons in the Cherokee
What I ain't get from slanging blocks I got from slanging words... SNOW
I got a car, that bitch a classic
Black scale white work clear plastic
Got 2 chains on, bitch I'm icey as fuck
And where I come from niggas bang for none
Every nigga in the hood gotta stand for some
Drinkin soda bakin soda I'm yammin up
In the kitchen at the table just a gram and up
My niggas grinding we banding up
These pussies know not to be playing with us... WORK
