Choppa kinda old, but a new clip
Shoot your ass, put yo ass on a news clip
Hope her two lips smell like tulips
Put you in the ground right next to the tulips
Got her in the suite, looking like a hooker
Jumpin' on the bed like Jimmy "Fly" Snuka
karma, but I believe in Kama Sutra
Then I skate away like Winnipeg
Got a dope spot called Escobar
Member when I used to play basketball
Now I'm out here playing ratchet ball, ooo!
Purple that Sprite in, then you pour it, you know we want it
Trap out that house with the doors open
She brought a friend who brought a friend
We gonna have us a foursome
We started up around 4 or somethin'
We did not stop til like 4 or somethin'
