Woke up this morning
Dick look like a flag pole
bad throat
Shit, 200 on the dash board
If you feeling froggy lil nigga gonna jump he still a lil tadpole
Here we go again
I drink a four again
Not going poor again
Young nigga supposed to win
I asked the Lord to forgive me
I used to jugg at Spondivits
Diamonds for wife and the children
This is my life I'ma live it
I got Jesus on my pendant
Make shopping look like a fitness
Ran the trap fuck the Olympics
I posted pics on my Insta
Don't you know I know logistics
Still got Riri on my wishlist
Spondivits, that's some south side shit
Some Atlanta shit, Virginia Avenue
I used to go up in there get me a bucket of crab legs, melted butter
But at the same time I got a jug in the parking lot though, you dig
I tell em', I tell em' meet me over there by the Waffle House
I'm selling bags though no lil shit no poquito
Muy grande, muy muy grande, plug talk
You muy poquito, me muy grande
