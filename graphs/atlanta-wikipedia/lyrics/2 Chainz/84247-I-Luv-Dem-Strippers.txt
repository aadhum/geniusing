Let's play big bank take little bank
You are looking at a shark in a fish tank
[Hook: 2 Chainz]
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
Yeah, I love them strippers
In my foreign car, got the trunk by the engine
So when I back back, I'm fronting on you niggas
Louie backpack
Where's Paris Hilton? Where's Kat Stacks?
I'm Rambo with this ammunition, my camo come from Tru Religion
your cutie missing, New Edition
Mr. Telephone man, there's something wrong with my line
When I call my baby's number, I get a click every time
Every line is dope, you can snort it
I can make you do aerobics
I'm haterphobic, they mad cause I'm winning
My weed so loud, everybody listen
My Boost Mobile chirping, it must be my amigo
Bitch, I rep that rich gang, Where's Stunna? Where's Wayne?
That's red on my wristband,
SB,
Mack Maine
Tell Tyga, lookin' for this bitch called Blac Chyna
Take a nigga bitch in a hot flash, menopause hot flash
Yes that's why I'm crowned queen, and I ain't lookin' for the prom king
These hoes' careers ain't promising,
killing these bitches -- crime scene
My door so cocky, my door so stuck up
Bitches stay pressed, I call them a space bar
Man I wish a bitch would,
hundred-thousand dollar engine,
I wish a bitch could
[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
