You be savin’ hoes (fuck ‘em), you be rest haven (fuck ‘em)
See the bitches blinkin’, BLUE C-NOTES, 
All of ‘em singin, BLUE C-NOTES
All of ‘em Franklins, BLUE C-NOTES
Draws come from Macy’s,
I keep on switchin’ wifeys, you gotta Uncle Phil me
Dreadlock Rasta, hair like pasta
I don’t see what’s your problem, I need an eye doctor
Flying to them dollars, ducking fly swatters
Told some dead presidents I’m finna bury you
When it come to presidents I like ‘em black and blue
I’m bout to buy a hog, I’m bringing home the bacon
