[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
Oh, oh, oh
Drop a hundred of them thangs put a little on my baby
Lil baby, lil baby
Oh-oh
I just bought a pair of Rollies, got one for my baby
Lil baby, oh-ohh, lil baby, ooh
Now I'm living for PETA cause I got a fox on me, ah
We gon' bust stops on the highway
I got my hands on her thighs
I play with her pussy and listen to Sade
Remember I barely used to eat
Now that my weed is so loud you can hear it down the street
you can't get rich off sleep
I call her my lil baby
She act like a lil baby
She spoiled like it was the worst
She trip I buy her the suitcases
Had sex in a few places
Bedroom, living room
Bathroom, kid's room and the basement
Straight shot, no chaser
Going down like the fire escape
Walk around with your dream on me
Never front on your team homie
