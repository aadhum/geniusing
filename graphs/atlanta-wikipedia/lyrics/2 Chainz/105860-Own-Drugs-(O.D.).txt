I ain't gotta fuck yo bitch, I got my own girl
I ain't gotta smoke your weed, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta drink your drink, I got my own drugs
I ain't gotta pop your pills, I got my own drugs
While you stressin' me, God keeps on blessing me
I know how to make money, this the recipe
Your pussy get rest to peace, especially murder scene
Hit her from the back, she like, "Hercules! Hercules!" (tell 'em)
Started from a pot, then I took over the spot
Then I took over the block, then I took over hip-hop
Then I started geekin', then I started tweekin'
Then I started reachin', then I stop speakin'
Finished Monday, started on the weekend
Gas in my car, I got gas in my 'gar
You can smell it when I'm passing your car
Its the last of the raw, all you need is a straw
And when I ain't feelin good, all I need is a mall
Your pockets on doughnuts
Got my posse out in broad day
Styrofoam cups got flying spirt
Double cup full of Ms. Buttersworth
Brownskin bitch in a tennis skirt
With some rolling papers, full of purp
I swear this game been good to me
Im a veteran in this game, why would I leave?
Real niggas, thats all I see, Pimp C, R.I.P
I'm up all night, like "Fuck some sleep"
Push start button, like "Fuck the key"
Ya'll niggas out here savin' hoes
I'mma start calling you niggas "Justice League"
I'm on codeine,
I'ma dope fiend
Got Molly world for that party girl
Ecstasy, she want the best of me
Turn her out, she a naughty girl
Your bitch choose my girl, like
I ain't gotta speak my wife, get her
Lickin' on me like an Optimo
Get a boy a Sprite and now pour a pitcher
450 for a zip of strong, codename: gas money
Magic City, cuttin' up, bitch shakin' their ass for me
Fuck the bitch in my back seat
If she hit the window, she a crash dummy
I'mma dope boy to get fast money
