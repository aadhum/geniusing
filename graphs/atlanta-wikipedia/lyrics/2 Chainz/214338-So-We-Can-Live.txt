If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
He got a badass niece with a donkey
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
