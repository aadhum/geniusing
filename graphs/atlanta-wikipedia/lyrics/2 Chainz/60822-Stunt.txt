Ok I'm stunting on you hoes, denim True Religion
9-1-1 I'd like to report my ceiling missing
What you know about that, I'm balling like leukemia
I'm off in Neiman's 'bout to buy a Fendi fur
Them niggas over me didn't understand
If I say it then I did it then I fucking meant it
I'm riding around in my city wit' the top down in my Bentley
And my windows up, nigga what, going hard and I don't give a fuck
