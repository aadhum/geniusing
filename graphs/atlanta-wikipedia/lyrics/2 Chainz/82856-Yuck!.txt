[Intro]
Yuck Daddy
Yuck Daddy
Cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
2 Chainz talking on the FLX phone
Former Posturepedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
all-black Ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in her tummy
Before Benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was Similac
I'm from where they send shots then we send em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Two guns on me, both with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the girls, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
How it go, it go fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the blickers, automatics no clickers
Man life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
one big chopper bitch
I got the chopper for the correspondents
The codine got me standing horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
We next, weed never left Holland
cop a tool
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her
He be like you could get her
I be like you could have her
He be like you could have her
He be like it don't matter
I be like, me neither
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
