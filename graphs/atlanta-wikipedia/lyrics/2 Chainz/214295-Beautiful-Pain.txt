Niggas studying shawty know what a hundred do
Actually the nigga backing me is right in front of you
Niggas can't even ball but bunt on you, them niggas lame
I hope you get testicular cancer in the brain, dickhead
Highly flammable, barely keep getting in Canada
Trying to express the beautiful pain witcha
Like a tattoo of a framed picture
Of a dead homie, maybe a family member
Scared money don't make no money
Bet now motherfucker gonna take them from me
[Verse 2: Ma$e]
Daddy deserted so now we syrup sandwich serving
But who I'm I kidding I had bridges but I just burned them
I gave my life up, I gave my rights up
You don't see my pain
I guess it's beautiful pain
It gotta be beautiful pain
Sometime you don't gotta say much
