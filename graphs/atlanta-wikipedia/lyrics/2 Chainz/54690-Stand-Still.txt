Long nights, more white and foresight
Foreseen in a foreign with the fog lights
Blowed up last summer off of the freestyles
Year before that, the plug was on redial
Couple years remove for the penile
State of mind: criminal enterprise
Individuals who want extra sides
And desert, so we gone need extra pies
Emphasize I pull girls like a exercise
I pull so many hoes I need extra guys
No sweat although the temp too high
She got me fucked up, I think the bitch too high
And I’m a southside astronaut,SA, that’s the acronym
The truck so big, it go beep backing in
Eating noodles, being frugal, open mic at Crucial
Martial arts flow, what I'm kickin is brutal
Fuck you busters and you suckers, you ain't shit in my pupil
Toaster in the kitchen, but I ain't fixing a stroodle
Cause I hang with street niggas that's still getting boodle
Cause my words are beautiful, I'm Mona Lisa of the speaker
Me and 2 chainz backstage blowin Keisha
Witta black and yellow bitch, you can call me Wiz Khalifa
You in park partner, I'm in eighth gear
I hear you haters hatin, I got great ears
Cause the ATL on top and we stay here, yeah
