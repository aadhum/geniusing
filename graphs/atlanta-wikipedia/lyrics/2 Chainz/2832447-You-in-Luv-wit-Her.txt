That Chanel shit, I like that
Got your own ride, I like that
Got your mind right, I like that
In a fantasy world, I'd wife that
At the blue flame with 2 chains on
Used to make juugs off the payphone
Hit Benihanas for a thousand rices
Garlic butter with the yum yum
You know the south side where I come from
Don Julio, trap house needs cuticles
Trap house need a studio
Trap house need a new sofa
These young niggas keep fuckin' on it
I do this shit so big I can get Puffy on it
I can tell you in love with her
Tell you in love with her
Yeah you can tell I'm just fuckin' her
Don't you tell that I'm fuckin' her
Yeah you can tell you be cuffin' her
Steady cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah you be cuffin' her while I be fuckin' her
Yeah
Drophead, yeah the brain gone
Yeah I smoke good, paper long
Paper good, wish you would twist the wood
Grip the wood, grip it good
Go and juug, get the good, split the goods
Get the guns, split the guns, flip the guns
Pour a deuce in a Mountain Dew
I still got her suckin' dick while she cottonmouth, yeah
