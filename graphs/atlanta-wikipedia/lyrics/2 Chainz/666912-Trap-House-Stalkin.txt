Turn the whole block to Vietnam
Made some legal money, ran off on Uncle Sam
Every seven days I might smoke a quarter bag, bag, bag
Bad bitches in my picture
Take yo ho and fuck her on the low just like a whisper
I used to eat at Crystal’s
Nah, I’m just lying, I used to meet at Crystal’s
Me and that bitch we gon’ ride in the trunk
Cause the hood of the car is not in the front
[Hook: Young Dolph]
Hmm, like LL, I’m in too deep with it
Little momma pussy so good, man, that I almost fell asleep in it
I don’t do dinners, no movie, no nothin’, no lunches, we fuckin’
And that’s the end of that discussion
