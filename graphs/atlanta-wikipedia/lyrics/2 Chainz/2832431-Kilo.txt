I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Pinky ring minus 30 below
And the dope man is my fuckin' hero
You know that I'm drinkin', I pour up on niggas
My style, and just like I throw up on niggas
VIP, I pour MoÃ«t on niggas, ayy
Triple beam to a digital scale, I got work in the mail
Clientele, I need a tractor trailer and a Ms Griselda
Ain't no joke like Rakim
I get it, I got it, I'm slangin' narcotics
I sold dope in college, I'm semi psychotic
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
I do this shit for the A
I bought a car just to race it
Hit the strip club in the day shift
Give a lil' bitch a donation
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo, walkin' like a kilo
Walkin' like I got a kilo
I'm walkin' like I got a kilo, I'm walkin' like a kilo
