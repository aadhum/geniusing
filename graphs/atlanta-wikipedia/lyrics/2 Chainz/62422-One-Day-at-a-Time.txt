Broken home, tell me what the fuck is wrong
Now I gotta charge a brick for a song
Trap guy, turned into a rap guy
No suit on but I still got trap ties
Argyles, pastels and some neckties
Shawty on the pill, X-file
40 hit 'em, leave 'em wet, baptised
And you know I'm a sucker for long hair and wet thighs
I got a present for you boo you looking at the future
As far as the past, nevermind that
My chromosomes read Georgia Dome
Gotta meet with my connect later on down in Malecone

All the Kush gone, gotta collect
On this mean five team parlay that a bush gone
Never on the guest list
Always unexpected
This is a lifestyle, I didn't have to write this
Look at my Hublot, watch how the light hit
Too dehydrated to cry nigga
I wish that pussy had a sign in it
That said,"Warning: If you hit it then you mine nigga"
