Drop the work in the pot, watch it cannonball
Rest in peace to my nigga, you da realest, dawg
You da realest, dawg, you da realest, dawg (x4)
I'm winning to the end, and I just made me some millions
And this only the beginning
I dive in her cervix
Chicken's, no churches
Closed casket, blasted, breathe again, Braxton
Heart filled with passion, neck filled with matches
Nonchalant and sarcastic, my bank roll gigantic
God bless all his babies
But he coulda retired and he was born in the 80's
I'm on my baby, I'm about my cash money
I'm tryna get meals like I'm past hungry
Pull your girl off my car, that's that whip appeal
I'm 'bout to milk the game, Enfamil
