Breakfast at Pappadeaux's
Trapping at the Stop-N-Go
Disect the beat and then I turn it to a particle
Cars mulatto
Too hard to swallow like UGKings
They say money is the root of all diseases
Summer vacation, one trip two bricks
(2 Chainz!)
I ran off told me catch me on the TV
See I'm from where you rob Peter to pay Paul
Big dog, big broads all in my circumference
Sipping Grey Goose
Rubberband fetish get it in abundance
Ben Franklins back to back, hundreds on hundreds
Gucci flip flops,
Yellow ring look like a funyon, or somethin'
