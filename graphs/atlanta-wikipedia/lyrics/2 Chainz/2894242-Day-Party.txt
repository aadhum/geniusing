Yeah, day party at my crib, you invited
Day party at my crib, bring a lighter
Ain't no lifeguard, yeah, I'm a trife God
Yeah, I'm a Drench God, yeah, hit up this park
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work
Yeah, you gon' need work, yeah, you gon' leave work
BBQ, no key cools, no cheap shoes
Good sea food, good beach food
Hublot or the AP, both of 'em cost 80 piece
Bales of weed down the street from the pasture
Got a garage filled up with Caspers
Me and my scale live happily ever after
