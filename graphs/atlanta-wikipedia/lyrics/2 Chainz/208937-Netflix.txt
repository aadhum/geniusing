I smoked a blunt for dinner, another blunt for breakfast
2 Chainz, got 'em staring at my necklace
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
Let's make a sex tape and put it on Netflix
I'm dodging paparazzi, my outfit from Versace
I just bought me a new watch and these new niggas just watchin'
When I die, bury me inside the liquor store
Cause when I die, Fergie still gon' be gettin' dough
You smoke that Bobby B-B-Brown,
we on that Shabba Ranks
Honor student wit' double Ds,
that ain't the bra
Yeah, yeah...
I'm gettin' to the monies, with an apostrophe
Fucked her on a pile of clothes, now she a closet freak
Yeah, I bear arms, I got something up my sleeve
Put it in her mouth, now she don't wanna speak
Yeah, I'm at the club, I got strippers at my table
I call doin' a 69 a favor for a favor
You can tell that I'm paid cause I'm high-class
We in a jet, who gon' fly past us?
And I don't get dropped, bitch, I drop the label
Goddamn!
