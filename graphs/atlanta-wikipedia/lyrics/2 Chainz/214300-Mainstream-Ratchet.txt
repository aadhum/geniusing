Got home, and I fucked her with my J's on
Her ass so big it look like she trying to walk backwards bruh
(Woah bring it back)
You from that RuPaul era
I'm from that hell nah era
Real niggas say tru
Box your ass, suitcase
I'm real, you ain't
Calamari, crab cakes
You lookin' at a star
I wish that they could add space
I'm getting money, fast pace
My hoes gay and my cash straight
He can't ball, he castrate
Balls out, I let 'em hang
Went on a double date with Molly and Mary Jane
You fuck with me, ain't no plan B
I'm a D boy with a degree
