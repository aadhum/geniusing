What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Hair weave killa I'll show up to your funeral
All this work I need a cubicle.
Clear coat cuticle
Different color diamonds like a rubrics cube
If this was New Edition, I'll be Bobby Brown
Put the check over your head and call it Nike Town
How could I be down? Free Boosie, wipe me down
I've been trapping since roxies had the ankles out
You a nobody; anorexic
If you stay next to me you're close to a blessing
So, I'm guessin' I could get arrested for aggravated flexin'
With all this ice on.
And everybody know this that body flow; bench press, cardio
They try to cramp a nigga style like a Charlie horse
I put a Glock to your eye and call it glaucoma Bow!
From 30 nights of sipping dirty Sprite
