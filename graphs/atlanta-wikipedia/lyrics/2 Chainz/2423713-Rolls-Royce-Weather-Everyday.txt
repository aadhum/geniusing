Bitches know my name and I don’t have to wear a necklace (2 Chainz)
Bought a Wraith for Winter and a vert for the Summer
Mama only child we stayed in a one bedroom (tru)
Used to ride MARTA ‘cause it had more leg room
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
First lick I made, I bought five pairs of Jordans
Drop some loose change on some clothes I can't pronounce
Bring your best friend, you don't need nobody else
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I just got a text message from wifey, nigga
I scroll down, the next message from Nike, nigga
I’m just doing it too big on these tiny niggas
I been lost my fuckin’ mind, I never mind these niggas
Pockets deep and I’mma get in depth like like Johnny nigga
Acting like they on the edge, I’m a step behind these niggas
Eyes chink like Chinese niggas
Fast lane, fast life, you blink you probably miss us
I think my palms are itching, I think my bomb is ticking
I keep that Maggie on me, I think I'm Homer Simpson
Money over bitches, should be a Bible scripture
Bitches, hoes, and women, I don’t know the difference
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
I do me, I get high, I get fly, I get paid
I do me, I get high, I get fly everyday
