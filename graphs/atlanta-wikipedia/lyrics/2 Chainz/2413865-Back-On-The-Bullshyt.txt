Big dually parked in my driveway
Hanging out that motherfucker sideways
Residue in my fingernail
make every day like Friday
This how we do it on the southside
Bumpin' Trapaveli on the car ride
Bad booty shots got you lopsided
I buy a new car if my car die
Solid gold Jesus, two of 'em
Backseat I'ma call it futon
It's four fur coats, I got a zoo of 'em
Come out that thing like yeet
Black ink all on my body
A to the motherfucking K nigga
Start spittin' lyrical bullets
We the type to ride in foreigns
We the type to ride on Forgis
Flame goin' up on a Tuesday
Big thing parked in the driveway
Squad hotter than Zimbabwe
IPhone got a nigga irate
Ringing all day, all day, like Kanye
Got AK bullets with your name on 'em
Powder on my hands, King James on 'em
Yeah nigga bout to go Ving Rhames on 'em
All my niggas brainless, need brain donors
We movin' birds, gettin' birds, shit stains on 'em
From Jumpstreet it's been M-O-B nigga
It's M-O-B since my D-O-B nigga
And since my D-O-B I've been on my J-O-B nigga
I shoot a nigga ass like Ginobili nigga
I kick a nigga ass like Shinobi nigga
I give your bitch dick like Moby nigga
She know the words to my songs, karaoke winner
Smokey Robinson couldn't out smoke me nigga
I'm on her cheese like anchovies nigga
I get a kilo and keep it lowkey nigga
Cause you on that bullshit and you nosy nigga
I'm back on my bullshit, gangster
I'm back up to full strength, gangster
Pat-pat at the pulpit, gangster, amen
And I still root for the underdog
These niggas ain't eatin' like a Ramadan
I shoot the driver in the head, make 'em honk the horn
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
I got the 100's big faces like a mongoloid (God forgive me)
And they pussy gettin' wetter than a thunderstorm
But I got this bright red bandana though
Flingin' it like I'm a matador
