(2 Chainz!)
Yeah, roll another one cause I’m winnin
In my four door looking real photogenic
Gentleman attire, in threads that won’t expire
I’m in a class of my own, my teacher got fired! (HA-HA)
Money getting long, pussy rate keep rising
Versace outfit cost me 3,000
From the P houses,did it from the wee hours
Selling that chicken no lemon pepper, no sweet and sour
First you get the power then you get respect
I’m getting so much money I can buy ya bitch
Take it how you wanna, if you wanna take it
I like clubs where all the women working naked
Fell in love with a waitress what the fuck I’m thinking
Bought that ho a ring, it was for her pinky
Uhn, that’s pimpin’ that’s slick
Got a bottle of cologne that cost more than your rent
(Tell'em!)
Skateboard on a nigga track
No lie, No Lie already got a plaque
Mama got a house, daughter got accounts
Just to think a nigga like me started with an ounce
Bad bitches and D-boys we bring ‘em out
If them niggas pussy, we douche ‘em, we clean ‘em out
This the voice of ghetto intelligence
If you got work, go to work, don’t work at your residence
