>What is it?
>Freebase
I thought if I said now, “Listen"
"Should I talk about freebase and what it"--or somethin?
And people say, "Well, no, because, then people will start doin' it"
No, let me--I gotta talk about what happened to me
See where we're from, it's all or nothing
But we take penitentiary chances like it's nothing
We came from nothing, from nothing
Freebase on top of the oven, get money my type of discussion
Ya'll could do this shit for free, a nigga like me gon' be hustlin'
Freebase (x9)
I came from nothing
Me and my niggas, we came from nothing, sold that caine like it’s nothing
Told you from the introduction I came from the pain and suffering
Two pit bulls and a TEC-9, TEC-9 use to jam up on me all the time
Swear to god if you come up in my mama yard
I’mma shoot that motherfucker till it get tired
And I keep shitting on the competition, I'm about to put out me out a shit tape
Guess we ain't playin' by no rules,
every night I freestyle on Pro Tools
Tell Flex come to the A we'll carjack him by one of them regular ass old schools
I don't respect my elders,
these right here Maison Margiela
I been a felon since fifteen, my expedition had a big screen
Half you niggas was constipated, half you niggas wasn't shit then
Zone one all the way to zone six,
Fuck y'all, I'll buy my own whip,
I done did a song with everybody from Jermaine Dupri down to Papoose
I came from nothing, I came from nothing
I came from nothing, I came from nothing
I came from nothing, I came from nothing
Work hard, play hard, work hard again
My bankroll had twins, can you comprehend?
Seafood lover, I don't eat pork
Used to hit them J's like a 3-point,
Nigga asked me why I don't drink, man, let me tell you what the wine do
My partner came in and said "This my girl", I had to tell that motherfucker "Mine too!"
Court dates in the summertime,
might pull up in a vert
No matter what the charges is, I'mma pull off with a smirk
This right here for Old Nat,
this right here for Godby Road
This right here for Riverdale,
trappin' at the Stop-N-Go
Trappin' at the Texaco,
it was Amaco before it was BP
Sold drugs to my loved ones and it's hard for me to admit it
The first time I've seen a crack pipe was in my parents' kitchen
