Hop up out that motherfucker swagging
Hop up out that motherfucker dabbing
Had an old school on some 'rellis
Used to go to school in some
Bally's
Flexing Macho Man Randy Savage
School of hard knocks I graduated
I got all my rims straight from Bailey's
Laying by my chopper, chopper laying by my safe
Ya my role model was Project Pat
Ain't judge a book by its cover turn the page
Codeine in a Styrofoam
