You know I'm different from them
I'm from a different cloth
I got a nina ross
9th grade, gettin' paid
Sunshine, no shade
All day, errday
Southwest Atlanta, A
I like it then I buy
Seen through you niggas like Ziplocs
Had me more white than a avalanche
I put that gas in a turkey bag
I'm back to my condo on Jupiter
Yo, Skooly, my nigga
What we gon' do on these niggas?
Rockin' Medusa on niggas
Quality tru
My cousin coolin', meant to say... my bousin boolin'
Then I'ma G5 it, just switched the climate
I'ma get married at Benihana's, have the reception at Follie's
