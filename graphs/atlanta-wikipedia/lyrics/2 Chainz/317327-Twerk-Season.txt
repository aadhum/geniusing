Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talking 'bout you popped the molly? You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino,
she is hot as jalapeno
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
Have you ever got some head while driving in reverse?
I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
keep it a C-note
When my main ho act like a P.O,
ain't that frio, that's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch, who just want dick and some to eat
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerking going on?
