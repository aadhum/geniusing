Got a red car so I bought a red bottom
I'm just livin' baby, and you got that right
I'm just livin' baby, I'mma enjoy this night
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
I'm just livin' baby, I'm just livin'
As far as running game, my nigga, I need a whistle
If you think you're alone then there Bobby Womack
Hold that, ridin' that Phantom down Old Nat
23 and I'm still livin'
Where's the Versace and where's the Tom Ford?
Everything we rap 'bout, that shit be ours
