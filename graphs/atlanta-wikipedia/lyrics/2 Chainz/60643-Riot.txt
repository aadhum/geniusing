I said lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
You in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet, lame niggas be quiet
You in the real nigga presence
Ya we smoking loud, so lame niggas be quiet
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators,
I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Iâ€™m true to this, True Religion
Cocaine on my left knuckle
