Take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
Take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
I say take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
Ta-take it off bitch, bend over let me see it
Rain hit my building make my window cry
My uncle on that gin that's like genocide
She start catching feelings I'mma catch a flight
She say I hurt her feelings now she dating dykes
[Hook x2]
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it
I say take that shit off, bend over let me see it
Take that shit off, bend over let me see it
They say the world is finna end so I made me a bucket list
They hollering Pimp C back, now what the fuck is up
Pimp C back, now what the fuck is up
