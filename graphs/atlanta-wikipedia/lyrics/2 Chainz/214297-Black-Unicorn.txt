And when you spiral through the atmosphere, all they see is motion
They never see the tears, they never feel the pain
They always think it's nothing but it's something, such a shame
So caught up in the fantasy, humanity has made a love story out of tragedy
But there is no romance in life that's on the ledge
Let the power paint the day, let the god have his say
Free at last, free at last, that's what I said when I got out my last deal
Some people can't relate, sleep is the cousin of death, that is some Nas shit
And everything is a obstacle
When they watching you, the hospital needs a hospital
Now they mocking you, they say the flattery is sincere
I rhyme like a nigga younger than me by ten years
Instagram pics of my lobster omelette
Selling that Parkay,
Now I got more nines than the fourth grade
Hear ye, hear ye, you can't come near me
Lyrically I could be Talib Kweli
But with gold teeth, it'd be hard for some to believe
I'm not a rat but I love the cheese
And my yard so big I got pet deers
I put my apron on, I taught myself how to make meals
Hit them loco jokers with the hocus pocus
Dirty ass niggas, we'll sell your ass a ki of soap
I done seen it all, watched a pregnant lady smoke
When the baby come out, he gon' be geeked
You never know, he might come out to feed me
