Smokin' out my brain cells
Got the trap doin' numbers
Got everybody wonderin'
How the hell I come back
N all summer got back to back to back back
No panties with the skirt
Don't make me have to flashback, nigga, and go buy 100 pounds
Drop 'em off downtown, smoke a L anyway
My hundreds hold they breath, cause they blue in the face
Roberto Cavalli, Dolce and Gabbana
Louis and Vuitton 'em
My pajamas designer, yeah
Shoppin' bag got me off balance, uh
Bet a hundred thousand with the Falcons
Lost a hundred thousand with the Falcons
I put my X at the end like Malcolm
Shopping spree
I don't really look at the prices
