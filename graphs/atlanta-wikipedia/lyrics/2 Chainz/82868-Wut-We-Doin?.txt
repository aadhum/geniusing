Crocodile dundee
At the strip club, two girls in front of me
Bend over hut one, hut two, hut three
Polo on my drawers, Polo on my shirt
I don't like her if she got a 'fro between her legs
I'm a real nigga, and bitches like real
Woah kemosabe, smokin' is my hobby
Woah kemosabe, big ballin' is my hobby
If I die tonight I got a bank roll on me
cheese on my broccoli
suicide doors
Rest in peace to my car door
Everywhere I go I'm strapped got that fuckin' tooly
