Tity Boi back,
Louie bandana
Tall ass nigga
look like I play for Atlanta
Look at my whip, it 2011
Look at my watch, this shit so bright that it's yellin
I'm a a problem like arithmetic
I have sex with my necklace on
Niggas know I got a special flow
Tity Boi they call me deuce for short
I just had an accident now I'm on Kush support
2 black cars on 24 inches
That's my first 48 I'm killing these niggas
Yeah, 2 Chainz, ya feel me, it's gonna be a hot summer man
I'm telling ya
I'm a burn you niggas personally
Burn you niggas,
bow bow, ya feel me
No guarana either nigga
