I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
I'm ghetto, excuse me
Yeah, I came from the mud
Came from the bottom
I bought a bandana for 600 dollars
Mr. Miyagi
I like that pussy real soggy
I used to stay with my cousins
Heat the house up with the oven
Airport tried to make us move without payin' us
We told 'em we ain't budgin'
I got some gold on my front tooth
And my hair grow like it's kudzu
Told her take a hike like hut two
I was raised by the Huxtables
See through you niggas like radio-ology
I dip my bread in the Kool-Aid
My partner wrecked the new car
He only had that bitch two days
I put hot sauce on my tater chips
The fact I said tater chips
Me and Ruth Chris, we got a relationship
For Christmas I want me a stove
For Christmas I want me a scale
For Christmas I want me some sandwich bags
But excuse me, please, excuse me. I'm tryna go that way... that way
