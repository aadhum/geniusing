Sitting in the trap 'bout to go bezerk
I take a sip of lean then i go to work
OK now when I was five
I went to Popeye's
My mamma said "Tit, you want some chicken and some fries?"
I said "No Ma, instead I want a brick"
I ain't learn ABC'S
Cause i was slangin keys
My whole team had free lunch cause i was trappin
Only time i don't be trappin is when i take a crap
[Verse 4:Kayne West]
You looking like some black cauliflower!
I went to New York and they booed me off the stage
