I'm 'bout my commas, I'm 'bout my come up
Tats on my stomach like Makaveli
They will act real really niggas acting sidity
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this for my, this for my road dawg
This for my road dawg, this is a real nigga role call
We spend it and get it back, we had invented that
See we on the internet, fly as an insect
Shine like the moonlight, told 'em gesundheit
I'm throwing cheese up like it's a food fight
They talking â€˜bout that dough and I tell you, I do not believe 'em
When I was on Codeine I went to the store and bought all of the liters
[?]
Trapping all night, you know the rules
Trapping all night, it ain't no rules
And all I do is sell shit, I should go on a cruise
