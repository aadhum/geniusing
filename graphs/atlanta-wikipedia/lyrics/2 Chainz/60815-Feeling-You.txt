2-hour long conversations on the phone, can't get you outta my mind
Breaking up with my ex was the hard part
Had to pull the ass out like the gar-bage
Bout to take this new thang to a pinnacle
You feel me, feeling you I ma-ssage your physical
Thank God... I'm spiritual
She ask me what I'm finna do I say get into you
One leg up followed by the other
We don't talk on the phone - we Tiger text
You 'memba Shonda, the one that had a Honda
Good head on her, you can learn a lot from her
3 cell phones she got all the numbers
