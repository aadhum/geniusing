Coke prices high, than which was if a Tony Montana
I just got me a bezel
My slippers is clean
All I wear Tru Religion
I paid a grip for them jeans
I got a lust for the cream
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
I need a money machine
So when you looking at me, I give you something to see
And I'm so fly I can sue an airplane
And I keep it 100, I don't need no spare change
Some do it for the fame, some do it for the fortune
Fortunately I'm famous, 26's wheel of fortune
And I been riding foreign since the fucking introduction
I need a money machine
Strip club tour started Magic, ended at Strokers
I came up on Luke Campbell
On medication, I can drink 200 a day
And if swag was a crime, I'd be doing life plus 30
