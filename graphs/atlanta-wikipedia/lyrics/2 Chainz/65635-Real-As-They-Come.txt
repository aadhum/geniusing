I can see why niggas hate ya, I can see why they despise
Red flag, red hat
And where will I be, without my E
Yeah without my street, and that’s Apple & Eagle bitch
Haha and how can I see
When my E-Y-Es are C-L-O-S-E
Or I-C-U N I-T
D-R.﻿ C-A-R-T-E… R
Or, R-I-P haha
Woke up this morning, feeling all horny
Picked up my pistol, fucked my opponent
They on the same shit we switched up the toilets
I looked in the mirror and I said what’s happening?
The mirror said “you are, you conceited bastard!"
When the players hit the club nigga leave some way
Had your girl in the suite swallowin' babies
Like Excedrin cause it’s this big
