Yo Tunes, pass the steel, or bash the steel
The pussy niggas are Massengil
mass appeal
My past is real before I had the deal, you dig?
Pies and cakes
Got the girl pussy smelling like Codeine Syrup
Got the bands on me like a football field, I'm ill
I deserve a threesome for my birthday
If she pretty it's Magic City on the first date
yeah I’m ‘posed to boast
Goodie Mo the quote, not many coming close
Trying to smoke what I never smoked before
Dream what I never dreamed before
Woke up and see my Rolls sky high
I ride by, I drive by then hop out
Ba-da-ba-da-beee
