I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Using baby bottles for the lean, wifey say I'm trippin
Plus I got Maybelline smeared right below my zipper
I’m a kama sutra reader and a conjure drinker
All we blow is strong, that’s why you weaker!
Waiting on the meal, I already put my plate up!
Marauder
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
It’s Jizzle 3 Watches, yeah that asshole!
One platinum, one white, one rose gold
I count money all night, I need some no-doz
Throw the money in the trunk, bitch the bank roll
I go hard in the mother fuckin kitchen, nigga
Got me staring at that water like I’m fishing, nigga!
Never know about me, I pull a bass out
Drop a 250 in and pull a half out
Had to do it for the town and the trap niggas
And nothin says butter like Parkay
And nothin make them Jay's stutter like hard yay
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
Started in the kitchen, king of the whipping
Denzel in glory, tear drop was missing
Just like the roof is,
riding in that Chris Brown
Two seater deuces, peeling like I skip town
neck full of black gold
Black diamonds got the Jesus piece like Manute Bol
That’s 2 Chainz, I'm 2 Stoves
For every one I cook, I make two clones
Mary Kate and Ashley, Tia and Tamera
Bandanna round the brick, I make it look look Jeezy
I go hard in the mother fuckin' kitchen
