[Verse 1]
357, I play the odds
[Hook]
I said "fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, I get that dough
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, and get this dough
[Verse 2]
Don Perignon and Saint Laurent
Ferragamo frames, I kick my dab
RIP to a real OG
South Florida home, coconuts in the trees
[Hook]
I said "fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, I get that dough
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
Fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes
I said "I fuck these niggas, and fuck these hoes"
I mind my business, and get this dough
