Tunechi and 2 Chainz
ColleGrove on!
Mike told me this gon' be your favorite song
I bought some gold chains with my drug money
Then wore it on the stage just to stunt on 'em
Might buy an AK usin' all 5s
Potato on the barrel for you small fries
Export, import checks on deck
Once the DJ drop this shit
Make 'em shake it like Tourette's
Smoking on the top floor, I'm as high as I can get
Lean in the baby bottle, I try not to babysit
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
ColleGrove, we out here,
all these bitches want this dope dick
And our pockets look like blowfish and we higher than some voltage
I got Trukfit on my back, bitch
on this Actavis I'm active
And my acronym is HB, that's for Hot Boy, you a has been
All this bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, you ain't gang, gang, gang, gang, gang
You ain't squad, squad, squad, squad, squad
you ain't hot like Häagen-Dazs®
Out here thrashin' with my crew, all you hearin' is, "Soo woo"
From New Orleans, that's voodoo
got a baby with New-New
And I'm smokin' like Badu
hoodie loccin', I'm Piru
No more YMCMB, hocus pocus, bye bye, poof
Bitch you mothafuckin' right, get a mothafuckin' life
Lil Tunechi out this bitch, drops the mothafuckin' mic
