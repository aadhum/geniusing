Started wit' a model, then I fucked her friend
making music no piano
Every beat I get on it end up dearly departed
Fuck how much it cost, I got to go have that
And if you been hustling, then we took the same route
Alligator belts when I flow no Izod
And I got techs like Georg-a, in my yellow jacket
drinking on that lavender
