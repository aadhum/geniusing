[Intro: Mike Posner]
Girl I'm on that clean shit, you already know
You ain't never seen this, I'm ready to go
I got em saying, I, I, I, I, I, I
I know I've been away
Baby I just landed, you gon pick me up
Heard you like to squirt, I might lick it up
And I slow it down like I'm on Robitussin
You blowing kisses, I throw em back, pull into that culdesac
One leg on my shoulder, other leg and it's over
Met her once and you missed me, girl you crazy
No makeup on, you're still pretty lady
I don't know if I should buy my wife a house, or make you my house wife
As far as race, you're first place, I'm only in town for one day
No autotune was used in the making of this recording, thank you for listening
