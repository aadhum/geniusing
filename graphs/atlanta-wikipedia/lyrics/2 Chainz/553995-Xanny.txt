There’s never ever a drought
My partner just did a whole decade
I just put the beam on the AK
I do it
I do it, I do it, I do it
They busting like mortar
they busting the hollow
Everything on Forgiatos
B’s
[?]
I’m just blowing money like a fan
Got them gold [?] shoes cost a band
I done came a long way from that Impala
Got gas, need 34 hundred for the bag
