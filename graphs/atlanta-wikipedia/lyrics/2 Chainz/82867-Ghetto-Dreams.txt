My ghetto dreams always turn to ghetto nightmares
At night I can't sleep, I toss and turn
Candlesticks in the dark
I was whippin' it hard
You Looking at a Nigga That Drove To Hell And Back
Got goons while you at it at this present time
Still Got Them Waiting In Line They Gotta Have
Last Night Was The First Night I Got Sleep
Tossing And Turning For Two Or Three Weeks
My Nightmares Are Triggered By Bad Memories
Lord, Send Me An Angel Right Now While I'm Having Ghetto Dreams
Used to dream about a bigger couch
Woke up in a bigger house, c'mon
So much money I had to let the banker count
But he died too young kuz the game cold
Got you lookin' at your homeboy sideways
They tell me crime pays, but I don't think so
A nigga in the game right now
Must be working for them people cause that shit played out
