It seems like everything I do is wrong, right on time
So I'll just stuff my bong
And try to drink some wine
To ease my mind
living in a nightmare
I need rehab, I can't take it
Find me so high, up in smoke clouds
Walk on the sky,
Then I start thinking, then I start drinking
I can't walk in the AA meeting
Know I'm addicted, my mind is afflicted
When I can't kick it, I need a one-way ticket
let my legs unfurl
I'm sick of my job, I'm sick of my boss
I'm sick of myself
I'm sick of this drink and I'm sick of this weed
It keeps me hurling, and down on my knees
Praying to the porcelain
That's when I blacked out
Either that, or I just passed out
