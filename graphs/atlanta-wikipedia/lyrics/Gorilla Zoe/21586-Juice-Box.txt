I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
Chinky like Mr. Miyagi
Extra fresh, I'm drippin' in Issey Miyake's
28's on tha chevy, ya know what it is
Buyin up the bar, cushin' a cigar
Menagin' widcha boy,
tryna drink my unborn
Shake it like Beyonce, go ring the alarm
I go hard
Hard like a rock
I pogo stick a bitch
Until she holla stop
Hood nigga shit meet me at the travelodge
Work a big chop
man I make that pussy fart
The girl can't win
Once I get it in
I turn her ass over
And make her back In
I roll with hood figgas
Real niggas, money gettas
Fuck with us, ay choppa hit ya
Choppa split ya shit
Uh enough of all that
Tryna make a juice box wet fall back
She got skin babygirl, haul ass
But I just follow the drip, follow the drip.. now
She's all on my dick, she's all on my dick.. wow
She's rockin' her hips, she's rockin' her hips.. pow
Now she's callin' it quits, callin' it quits..
I make a Juice box wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet
I make a Juice box drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip
I make a Juice box talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
I make a juice box pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop
