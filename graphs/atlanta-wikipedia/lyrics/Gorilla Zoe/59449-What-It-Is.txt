We took the 4's of the Chevy and we set it on those 6's
Twenty rubber bands you can get yourself a pigeon
Bring another band get yourself a pound of midget
Quarter milli worth of jewelry
Like that boy can't even care
Boy you better hold your nose
Cuz I'm shitting, hold your nose
Get a Louis bag for what?
Bitch I been had swag
I got 50 thou cash in a brown Kroger bag
I'm flipping like we on a plane
It must be how we taking off
Putting mileage on my Pyrex
Yeah we call that baking off
Never wear a rubber
Where I'm from we call that living fast
Puerto Rico, s√≠ gordito
I'm speaking the facts
It's Deeper Than Rap
But I'm living in a mansion
And I'm riding in a Lambo
Bunch of ganstas like Sopranos
Like keys, like pianos
Urkel purple pants are cushioned
Straight from Oakland they just flew in
If I bust that package open
You would think I started booing
