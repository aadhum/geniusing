You say ya man got a fountain
Boy I got a jet
You say he got money
Bitch I got a check
Join the Mile High Club
Get that juicebox wet
And need to fly with me
Baby flow with me
Baby fly with me
Need to flow with me
I got money on my wrist Franck Muller
So much ice
I am cool like a cooler
She got good brain, I’ma use her, school her
Send her back to you, yeah I fooled her
Fooled ya!
You can take her shoppin’
You’re a trick
You’re a loser
Me, I’m in Miami on a yacht, like a cruise, brah
Shittin’ on these niggas, grab a pooper (scooper)
And baby could you see me where a G like me can smoke?
See my dog is from the hood & he just wants some hen & coke
Nah, just the actresses
They know who we are, so we fuckin’ on their mattresses
Twenty thousand feet in the sky smokin’ Mary Jane
On my own plane
And I ain’t lyin’ mane
See the logo?
That Gorilla face…
