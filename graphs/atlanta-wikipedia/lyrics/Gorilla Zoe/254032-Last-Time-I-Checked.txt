It ain't about where you at it's about where you from
If you ever go back they might hit you with a drum (bah)
You a g somewhere else but at home you's a bitch
Pusy ass rappers fake ass niggas
Metaphorical gangsta studio killas
Everybody know you been lame
Tryna hide behind a chain and a nickname
That's a damn shame
Talk dat shit like da hood don't really know da hood despise you
I kick it with da same niggas use to bully you in highschool nigga
Who you lyin to? nigga we ca' see straight through you like a x-ray nigga
Me I'm Gorilla you'd be me if you could
But I don't think you can cause they say you Hollywood
What if the same dude you looked up to was a rapper
And you realized he wasn't nothing like you (damn)
He ain't watch the shit bubble
He ain't see the same struggle
He ain't never go what you been through (aight I'm finna keep it real with him now)
Real niggas don't feel dem nigga
And on some real nigga shit man I feel you niggas
We like we miss Pac we need to hear Dre we miss Big N.W.A
Well what do they say "well here go this and listen to that"
Man somebody tell these labels that they artists are whack
? cds are frisbees we call em drink coasters
Wastin all ya money on these flyers and posters
Try to make it look good buy you a sound scan
Is that the damn plan well here's a helping hand
You want some real sells you need the damn hood
If you don't want to sell wood then don't go Hollywood
Oh surrounded by security and police
But you claim gangsta bullshit pussy nigga show me
