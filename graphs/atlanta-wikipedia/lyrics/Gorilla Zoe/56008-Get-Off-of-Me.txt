My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her I don't care cause I got all these hoes all over me
I got ice all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Get off of me get off of me get these hoes up off of me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
I got racks all over me
I bust her thirty minutes bust a nut now get up off of me
My ex girlfriend called and said that she was over me
I told her I don't care cause I got all these hoes all over me
I got tats all over me I got ice all over me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
Get off of me get off of me get these hoes up off of me
I'm brushing off my body tryna get these hoes up off of me
That A I get 'em off of me
That hundred round drum like a grill
Tell 'em bring the beef
I do it so properly
They do it so sloppily
These boys ain't got no game, so mane they tryna take it off of me
Man up, that's your girlfriend
Tell your girl stop callin' me
Textin' me and stalkin' me
Get your girlfriend off of me
Treat her like a dog dog let her lick it off of me
Smokin' on some purple tree
