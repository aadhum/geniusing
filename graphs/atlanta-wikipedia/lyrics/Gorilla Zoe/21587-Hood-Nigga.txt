Nigga you can hate but ya bitch steady watchin
We bottle poppin, you cock blockin
Told ya girl you rap but your CD floppin
Say you gettin money man we ain't seen nothin
Man she say she want a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
Trunk stay bumpin' y'all know we run the town
I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Any my chevy's sit on 24's
Flats look like flapjakes, pancakes
Hood nigga
But I'm a keep it hood folk
And I dont need a scale for the work
I can eyeball purp
I am not you jerk
Hatin' on me will make your situation worse
You dont wanna take a ride in that long black hearse
All eyes on me, shawty I'm a bomb first
I'm the truth and they say the truth hurts
Hustle mean hard work, hard work
If you scared go to church
Man this rap shit is easy, every beat I get I murk
Cause I'm a hood nigga
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
Hood nigga
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
Hood nigga
And my chevy sittin on 24's
Eveesus we dont rock white tees
Camo bathing apes, 10 pair every week
Manasha 3
the gurls suck me to sleep
Z-O-E climax to the peak
I see you, naw you see me
You'll see ICU fuckin with me
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
And I keep a bad bitch around
Thick bitch, long hair, yellow, white, red, brown
And my chevy sittin on 24's
They can take me out the hood
But I'm a keep it hood folk
Watchin out for goldiggers like kanye
But I will pay beyonce
Or ashantay
Make kieshia cole say she should've cheated if she eva come my way
Get some head from fantasia on the highway
Trickin off majic city
I keep the purp by the pound
The trunk stay bumpin, y'all know we run the town
