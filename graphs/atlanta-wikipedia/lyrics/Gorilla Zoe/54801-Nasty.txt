Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
Million dollar trap, but the spot so nasty
White so clean but the pot still nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, that nasty
Nasty, Nasty
Nasty, you're so nasty
A hundred on the coup, so the whip look nasty
Fifty on the watch, so my wrist look nasty
Same color as your daughter prom limousine
