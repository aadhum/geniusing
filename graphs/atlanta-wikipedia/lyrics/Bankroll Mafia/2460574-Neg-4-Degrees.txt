Free the Goat, hey
I'ma pop the seal and pour the Act up
Excuse my french, but you can’t find a bitch we ain't bagged up
But I’m too rich for her so I backed doored her
I saw my name on a Coke-Cola, it said Jeff, shoulda said Thugga
They say me and my cup is the best couple
Cause I drink it for breakfast, lunch, and supper
I'm not a fuck nigga, didn't go to the other side
If I pull up my sleeves it's Negative 4 Degrees
I’mma pop the seal and pour the Act up
tender
We on Actavis Dinner,  on Actavis Dinner, on Actavis Dinner
I’m pop the seal and pour the Act up
Excuse my french
Chris with the rock and the way with i
I’m pop the seal and pour the Act up
