R.I.P. to Troupe
My IV is red like thermometers
Se pasa en mi casa
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie
A.K.O.O. and Hustle Gang did thirty somethin' million
Another seven off of television, put that with it
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie
Se pasa en mi casa
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie
Yellow, purp, red drank though
I put on that gold like Gaddafi, yeah
Se pasa en mi casa
I got stripes like a zebra, homie
I'm laughin' like a hyena, homie
