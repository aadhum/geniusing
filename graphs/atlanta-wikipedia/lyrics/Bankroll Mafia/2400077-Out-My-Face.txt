Let the yopper rain down if you stop my pay
I'mma pull up in the Porsche with a hoe in that bitch
The Cayenne baby, gotta go foreign that bitch
First my palms was sweating now then they was itching
Now i pull out them thigh pads on them bitches
I talk to Roscoe every day like he ain't missin'
I'ma pull up in the Porsche with a hoe in that bitch
The Cayenne baby, gotta go foreign that bitch
I gotta, top off it ain't for rent
Fuck a, tongue bitch I'm not a lick
Jump, jump up on that baby ribbit
No frog, but I came up out the motherfuckin' trenches
Dig it?
Pimp her ride like Xzibit did it
I'm in Japan like a fuckin' skillet
Do you dig it?
but I know that she with it
Dig it? Dig it? She bought a cat I bought a jag kitty
Boy, you a dub, I ain't talking twenties
Raining bullets on your cuz man I hope he with it
I'm that boy yeah yeah but I'm not kiddin'
I asked her do she got a passport she said if she didn't I would purchase it so what'd I ask for
I'ma pull up in the Porsche with a hoe in that bitch
The Cayenne baby, gotta go foreign that bitch
backwoods stuffed with Chevron
Trap 24/7 like the telethon, banging heavy metal call him Megatron
Miss me with the bullshit is what you better do, Boyz N tha Hood, young nigga with a attitude
Bitches fuck, I give a fuck right now
Might try me, the plug'll pull up right now
two cents,
I'ma pull up in the Porsche with a hoe in that bitch
The Cayenne baby, gotta go foreign that bitch
