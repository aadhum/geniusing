Yuh, yuh yuh
I bought the coupe just to play with it
Lil mama want me to save the bitch
On the block like I'm Jadakiss
Said she hard to find like some Actavis
How you feel with this money on you?
How you feel with this rollie on you?
This how you feel when you came from nothing
This how you feel when you up one
Up one, up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one
This how it feel when you up one
Hundred thousand, yea I got it
Me and my niggas, hardbody
We don't really talk about it
We rather show 'em
Let you talk about it
Migo Gang, Bankroll Mafia
I bought the coupe just to play with it
Lil mama want me to save the bitch
On the block like I'm Jadakiss
Said she hard to find like some Activis
How you feel with this money on you?
How you feel with this rollie on you?
This how you feel when you came from nothing
This how you feel when you up one
Up one, up one
This how it feel when you up one (x4)
Everyday you do Margiela shoes
Keep them pistols what the fellas do
I picked up deez blue hundreds out the dirt
We ballin hard we need some headbands
We smokin hard we on that headband
