If a nigga out of line the .45 go to squirtin'
I'ma probably about the hardest ever out of Atlanta
Forever I love Atlanta like a FILA
hitstick Madden, Eli
I might get caught up with lots of guns like TI
I don't want your ho, I want your honey like a beehive
I don't want your ho, I want your honey like a beehive
Plain hundreds, they like Jane
Bitch I'm all in these streets like a Reindeer
Too much cheese, got that Mac all on me
Got a whole bunch of pills in the sack, and they blue dolphins
I been jumped off my momma porch
Give education like Du Bois
Cliff, I'm a bloody little dog
12 inches in her like a yard
