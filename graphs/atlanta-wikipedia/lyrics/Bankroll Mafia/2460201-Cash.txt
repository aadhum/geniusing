Trying to get a dime to a number
take it out of town, double
Ion give no damn
broke then
,
No matter what, ion save no hoe, ain't got no cape for some
When you start getting money
A lawyer erase your case for some
These lawyers erase these cases
I put my nut on they faces
Black diamonds, today I'm racist
Had money 'fore I had babies
Cause they to busy running 'round misbehaving
When they come with questions I'm like shh
Cheese, I pulled up with it, bitch I get it
Pump tha
all on her face
before I perform
