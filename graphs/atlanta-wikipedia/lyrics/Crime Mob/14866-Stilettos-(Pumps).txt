Stiletto pumps in the club
Stiletto pumps in the club, get crunk
But if a ho say somethin, try me then her hair will get thrown
I'm turnin' heads left and right soon as he see one foot
Step out the car, strollin' through the club
Then I make my way right by the bar, yeah yo nigga eyein' me
But I got a sexy mouth, hair is done and nails are too
And I match from head to toe, then to top it off
I'm rockin' 6-inch black stilettos ho
We swangin' throwin' bows, cuz' yall boys thought we soft
I'm knockin' heads off, I'm the baddest of 'em all
Makin' niggas fall, mane they fightin' and tusslin'
Club owner scared that the gurls might start bussin'
I got my gurl Aisha and the Princess on a shoppin' spree
I get 'em for they goodies, and get richer ain't no pitty
