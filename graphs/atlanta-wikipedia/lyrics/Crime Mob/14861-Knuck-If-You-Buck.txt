Well, I'ma gat-toting, pistol-holding nigga on your damn street
Stomping, jumping, bumping, and we crunk off in this damn thing
Throwing them bows up at these hoes
they screaming, they bleeding from they nose
But when we start to swing, we make them niggas hit the flo'
Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
Yeah, we knucking and bucking and ready to fight
It be like Sadaam Husein, Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden
Jumping off from on the stage, throwing bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas starting riots, knocking down the barricade
you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets busting constantly, rapping in your city streets
I come in the club, shaking my dreads
Throwing these bows and busting these heads
I been in drama and committing a crime
Not leaving a trace, not leaving a line
We knucking and bucking 'cause I got a nine
You bucking on us and we leave you in plastic
Anybody make a false move, dead bodies on the flo'
