The sun takes a bow for a day well lit
Next act is night with an audience of brothers and sisters
Sisters have always fascinated me
The many shades, the many sizes and features
I try not to admire what I can't obtain or have
Things beyond my reach don't exist to Speech
Seeing how I'm a bit shorter than the average man
I live my life in an outcast tribe
A tribe that strives to see a brighter day
I foresee that I'll walk with closed eyyyyes, until dawn
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Dawn of the dreads
Rejection is a fear of mine, for one reason or another
But I still asked for a date with this woman
Slowly, all, the shades, sizes, and features
Became less different, and more, the same
Except a certain female with all new featurrrres
But I knew not her name
