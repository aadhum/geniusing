Ladies and gentlemen, there are seven acknowledged wonders of the world
You are about to witness the eighth
Space ain't man's final frontier. Man's final frontier is the soul
Guided by someone more powerful than any human being
Someone felt but never seen.
You will be surprised of what resides
In your insides...
