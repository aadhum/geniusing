We sittin' on lebron back over here
I'm sittin' high ridin' on lebron back (uh, ha)
Des 23's (uh, ha)
I got more grams than Teddy
Look like I'm glidin' on nothin', when I ride I be skatin'
They only ridin' on 20's
They might as well ride on hubs, if it ain't deuces or better
Or white leather guts
23's on my fuckin' so I ride and I swerve
Michael Jordan's mounted up darts 23's on the ride
I got man in the trunk, I'm workin' the alpine
big boy drop
Got 66 lebron back home, look I'm sittin' right on it, comin' up in
cutlits
lean 'n rock
in the rear view mirror
