Yeah I switched it up, I got a 9 cuffed tightly
So you'd better do the right thing like Spike Lee
rock jeans with a white tee
wanna bite me
Yeah these niggas mad cause I'm shining like a light beam
Muhammad where they sold that
We stepping on these niggas like a mother fucking door mat
When I hit the scene they take pictures, call me Kodak
These ho's goin crazy, yeah I think they need some prozac
spendin all tha
thriller in manilla
So So niggas, ain't no crew illa than
We lounge around in our white tee
deep down to ya brown tee
Six 0, six four four
Blow 'dro with the windows up on deuce four's
?
Same chick, same clique, more bricks in the bank
It ain't no showdown for no crown, I'm holding that
They saw me on VH, pay great till this day
Been in love with the mic since Run-D.M.C. walked this way
JD pays me,
I'm Bow Weezy, prince of the O-town
I ain't gotta act hard, I'm under 21 with a black card
And yea I know that was kind of a low blow
But the dough for the So So don't come slow
