Give me Georgia Dome like I'm sittin' off at The Omni
Like the Flintstones, yeah, makin' the bed rock
Give you some, and you some, and you some, and you some
It ain't no fun if my homies can't have none
Rollin' like a fool lookin' for me some cut
Let Parlae hit, together we like twin towers
Askin' where the purp, where the Goose, and where the pills is
I don't wanna fuck though, I want me some pigeon lip
Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Do it with no hands
Fuck 'em good and straight get ghost just like Casper
