Lean wit it, rock wit it!
I bounce in the club so the hoes call me Rocky
Posted in the cut
looking for a blockhead
Yup in my white tee
I break a bitch back
Oh I think they like that
higher than a plane
Perfect example watch me make your face beat up my hands
I'm too clean to wanna pop lock
From left to right a nigga lean
purple green
grams in my sock
Old school people pat cha feet
I keep a full clip and my pistol in my pants
I ain't Fat Joe
But snap your fingers then you lean back
Call me Teddy, I got grams
Lean back like Fat Joe
Slow it up do the Matrix
