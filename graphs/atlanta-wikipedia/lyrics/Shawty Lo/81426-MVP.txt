Ey, ey, Audemar parkay
Gonna hunt
Westside Bankhead, I’m from Bowen Homes
Fake ass rappers tryin' to live like us
Dope boy loving all that fake ass jewelry
Y'all some twitter gangsters, facebook bullies
And everything cossa, (cossa)
Cossa Nostra
He eat it, I beat it, found out she cheated, he heated
He text me, wanna question me 'bout a bitch I deleted
I be the fucker and leave 'em, you tellin' her that you love her
Can’t hustle the hustle her cause I’m busting her while you cuffing her
