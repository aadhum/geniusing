I'm the man 'round here, capiche?
Brown paper bag, ol' dope boy money
Ol' dope boy money
Small face hundred, ninety-fo' money
Easily I approach
The microphone, yeah the kid's no joke
Tell your ho to get off of my dick
Hypnotized by this shit that I spit
Now I'm gettin twenty thousand fee
DAAAAMN~! 20 thousand to speak?
Seventeen-five if you want a ki'
Get a 10-pack, 17 apiece
Call me Big Bird like Sesame Street
Cookin up a chicken cause the rent due, monday
Magic City money, still blowin money
Body Tap Wednesday, still throwin money
"Units in the City" I done sold another hundred
Real brick runner, nigga on the corner
On my grandmama, got more chickens than a farmer
Got 'em get 'em ready cause them country boys is comin
Where yo' peoples at? Tell 'em go on and place they order
