I come through in somethin real foolish
And they like, boy you a fool with it
And he like, boy you a fool with it
And she like, boy you a fool with it
I come through in some real Coupe-ish
Transparent; see right through it
And oh yeah! And this that new shit
L-O, and bitch I do this
Shawty Lo, I'm ten toes down
Up the sideline tryin to stay in bounds
I just sold a hundred and it just touched down
Call them aliens, time to re-up now
Yeah! And yeah, love my D-boy style
Man all the dope boys got the girls goin wild
Yeahhhh~! I'm like nah nah nahhh
I'm laughin at you niggas like ha ha hahhh! Let's go
They know, I'm Lo, I'm C, E-O
Yeah! Yeahhh, come fly with me
I hear 'em whisperin on how fly he be
I'm gettin money, dubs fifties hundreds
I stay with them goons and you don't want no problems
Early in the mornin in the kitchen like my momma
