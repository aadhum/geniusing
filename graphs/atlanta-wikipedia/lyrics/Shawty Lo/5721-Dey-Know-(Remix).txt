Eight balls same price as the kilo
Like Kells I believe I can flizzy
So I took the top off like a Playboy Bunny
Riding down 85 while I'm stunting on my
Gixxer
And six David Beckhams or a trunk full of kickers
Take a picture of the mister it'll last long
I'm in my Cool Whip, inside's Jello
Hop up out that pretty muthafucka like hello
(Hello) Hello, ladies how you doing
That nigga crazy girl, don't say nothin to him
Hit da club with twenty broads like Flava
I'm on the top floor no neighbors
Who you kidding I get my 87's tailored
Went from two ounces to a Maserati
Before they know what's under my shirt the Glock 40
Get twenty-five a show next month I want forty
Cut my dog off I heard he snitchin too
And that don't sound right
I swear you can get a full clip not a sound bite
SU-WU gang and if you ain't with it then you in the food chain
I keep a black Glock red dot blue flame
Feet hanging out the window jock my shoe game
Cause all my kicks fly like Liu Kang
Old player new game
I'm focused I'm thinking like I got two brains
I don't know what you do but I do thangs
