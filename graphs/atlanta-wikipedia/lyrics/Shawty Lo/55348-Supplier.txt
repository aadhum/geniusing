I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
I got diamonds round my neck like a baseball field
I married Snow White 'cause she make me cream
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
He can spend money but we can spend a day lil mama
Shawty, I can carry you like Mariah
I got something that they need, I got something that they want
I got something that they need, call me the supplier
