Like 40, don't save her
Shawty Lo, ATL, I'm the mayor
Every day and then, shawty might rock gators
I'm the man and they know that
A hundred grand, what's that?
I hit club and I blow that
You said they see three, I'm the one in the middle
Yeah, now I'm geeked
A-Town fitted, who but me
L-O, she know, he know, they know, I am
