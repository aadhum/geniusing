Chronomentrophobia, the fear of clocks
The fear of time...
High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say, be strooong
Hooo yeahhhhahhh
I ain't' got tiiiime
Leave me aloone
Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Born in 1975
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
Using welfare as a crutch
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient
Remember what I said
I'm gone
Bow ya heads
