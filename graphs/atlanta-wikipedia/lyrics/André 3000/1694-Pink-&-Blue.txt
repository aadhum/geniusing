Age ain't nuthin but a number
Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
In a Claire Huxtable type way
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun
You're sophisticated
Just me and miss lady
You've got me talkin like a baby
You make me talk baby talk
She makes me talk baby talk
Got me talkin like a baby
Like ga ga and goo goo
