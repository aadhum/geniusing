Its about to get bananas in here
Hey look at that ape,over that baby
But just don't tap the glass
Don't tap the glass
I'm telling you i'll go crazy
I beat on my chest because I am the best
I'm the king of the jungle
And I ain't lying
Get I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Naw I a'int no lion
Now you can tell King Kong
He don't run this
You can't throw no monkey wrench in this
Hey, can you tell Mr. zookeeper to please order me a 1000 pounds of banana pudding
I would love that
