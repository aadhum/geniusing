She said boy do you think this pussy free
You know a young nigga can’t hit it and quit it
Quit her then come back like Frisbee
Ain’t gon lie, I think I’m addicted
And my main girl keeps tripping
My side ho taking my benjamins
And she might leave you wet, you call her natnat
Hit it and quit it, I’m leaving her dripping
Walk around with jewels, no Dipset
And she might leave you wet, you call her natnat
Said she was feeling my feng shui
And the way that I macho man flex
Giuseppe steppers or the red bottoms
That’s 1000 dollars each feet
She sucking me up, out of control
Lord have mercy, take my soul
Addicted to her like dirty Sprite
And she might leave you wet, you call her natnat
