Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Model ho, yeah she with me
Living life like I’m Diddy
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap, trap house jumping like Jordan
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap, trap house jumping like Jordan
Pulled up in the drop top phantom
Niggas in the hood can’t stand it
Whip game is so special
I got Molly, I got white, Marilyn Mason!
Feeling like Mutombo
Dark skinned ho, cook up the dope, she look like Nestle
Auggh!!
Uh, aye bitch, tongue out
Tim Duncan
My nigga came with some white girl
I told that nigga no doubt
If I ain't the rawest out, I'm like Willis what the fuck you talkin' bout
At D.O.A with 40 thousand, with 40 bitches bout to blow it
Rich game, LK
Tatted up like a esse'
My AP worth a house on the lake
Got the trap house jumping like Kobe
Cashed a hundred K on the rollie
I’m Jordan, you not even Kobe
I’m a free man, no Morgan!
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter
If I start shooting, turn to a track runner
