My bitch too foreign, need a visa, I don't need her
My bitch too foreign, need a visa, I don't need her
I woke up thinking about bands, Hop off a jet to a check when I land
put the plug on three way, Maserati go speed race
Drop a baby on a bitch face
the pharmacy knowing my name
I fuck that bitch cause she bougie, she suck my dick in the movies
Trap jumping like 23
she a foreign girl, a freak
I woke up thinking about bands
My bitch too foreign, need a visa, I don't need her
blue cheese in my pants
fuck on your bitch cause she bi
She know that young Fergie the man
cause I put them big stones on my hand
Aye, she say trap lord what's the plan
My bitch too foreign, need a visa, I don't need her
Wake up to some neck, Rich told me to flex
Dominican ones, shawty wanna have fun
Backwood on her lip
Yeah stay up in your lane, Tokyo make it rain
Ten bands on a coat
My bitch too foreign, need a visa, I don't need her
