Lil nigga quit bitchin', I ball like a Piston
Looking for me, pussy nigga you found me
All my niggas got a stack of the cheddar
Pull off in a foreign like its Andretti
I beat my case, fuck the cops
Bring that scale, fuck the 12
Drop a bird on the stove
Had to get it, god knows
Rich nigga, I was broke
Now I’m ballin’ like a champ
Break a bitch with a stamp
Them diamonds they shining lil nigga
The chopper it hit you, my shooters official
Bought a chopper with a scope
They was hating, I’m the GOAT
Drop a baby in her throat
I ain’t doing shows if it ain’t dividends
eighty-nine
Nigga run up, that’s his arm, that’s his leg, that’s his head
Then that nigga dead
That’s what happen when you talk to feds
I put that bitch in Chanel
Geeking on molly, can’t sleep
Then I crashed the Maserati twice
You won’t make this much in one life
