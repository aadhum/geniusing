Bitches, they get on my nerves
The Rollie it cost me a vert
I just might put all my chains on
Still sippin syrup outta styrofoam
Bitches I fuck then they goin' home!
Racking and stacking the paper
Sipping the syrup in the morning
I'm flexing on purpose, I bought a Bugatti
Addicted to chasing the cash
They asking me what I been doing
The money it's coming it's moving
