Rich on the beat one time
I got that white like Topanga
Walkin’ in trap with my banger
A mansion I don’t got no neighbors
The Goyard got racks you a hater
Run it up, got 50 racks, my pockets stuffed
I got a Glock like a ranger
You cuffing’ that ho like a cop, I'm bagging queens on the block
Rick owens it cost me a whole lot of guap
I'm just tryna' duck them people in them crown vics
Pour a four then slow up
Recording on the back of the bus and I'm poured up, (Swear)
Make the lil bitch jump like a frog yeah nigga I told her
I need that lean like a patient
Give a fuck about magazines, pistol came with magazines
They hating’ on me I don’t care, Fendi socks and underwear
In love with the man in the mirror
We
The Mazi paint it matte black
