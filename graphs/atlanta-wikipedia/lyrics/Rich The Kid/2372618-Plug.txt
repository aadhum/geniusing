The kitchen done turn into Michael like Jackson, I'm takin' the pint and I'm beatin' it
I'm mixin' the chemical, turn to a chemist and people done call me a genius
I was 13, ran up on the plug, stickin' 'em up for the drugs
They callin' my Motorola with zippers, I'm out in Jamaica with strippers
jugg
set
Bitch, you know I bag it, Raf Simons bag
Bought my hoe some Palace
bale
It’s snowing in my attic, it’s snowing in my yard
I'm ballin' on you niggas don't nobody fuck wit you cause you a scrub
30 inches on that G body, nigga I don't ride dub, really, im the plug
Kodak, why you do me like that? I just want a lil love, lil bitch I'm a thug
Nigga already know what's up, so don't try to dap me up, when you see me in the club
What you expect? I'm booted up
I got the key wrapped up in the Louis V now they call me the plug
