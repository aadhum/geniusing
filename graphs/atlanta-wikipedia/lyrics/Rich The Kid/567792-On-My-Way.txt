On my way to the jeweler
Told nigga that I need a new chain
(that I need a new chain)
On my way to my jeweler
Told that nigga that I need like two chains
(that I need like two chains)
And if a nigga try to snatch it
Then that nigga gonna need a new brain
(he gonna need a new brain)
Chewy 7:30 loco I'ma show you nigga's how to do things
she looked at my pinky she gave me the brain
Walk in the bank and they knowing my name
I'd rather be rich before the fame
You ain't drop 50 racks on the Rollie
In the trap I been trappin' until I OD
Bitch I’m trapping and dappin, like my young nigga Rich
Red dot on a Glock, that’s a beam on it
