My bitches are foreign
Young nigga, trap jumping like kangaroo
I meet up with Kirko in Houston
Too much for you nigga, my whip cost too much for you nigga
Young nigga taking off like a missle
She’ll suck me, she’ll swallow, you’ll kiss her
young nigga I pull up in ghosts
All my hoes got money, red bottoms ain’t nothing
Pull up in the Masi, she stunting
Like Biggie, want more money
My necklace it look like the glacier
It’s way too much ice
