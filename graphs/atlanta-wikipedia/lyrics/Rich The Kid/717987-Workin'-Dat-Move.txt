Flooded out Rolex, flexing like Boflex
Bitch looking so hard, bout to break her neck
Used to be the nigga with the flat screens in the back
Say you don’t like me when you see me, like Matt [?], we can get to clapping
Woah, you better move, don’t be mistaken by my Loubotin shoes
I’m not a fool but I dropped out of school
I made a million on the avenue
