[Intro]
Eye, caught my eye
Baby, you caught my eye
Caught my eye
Baby girl I ainâ€™t just playin'
I really need you
I was tourin' on the road
Came home to see you
Thank you God for my soulmate
I told you that we gon' be straight
No chance it was fake
Got outta jail beat the case
Now we ridin' round the hills out in Hollywood
Told your momma you with me
And we gon' be good
Diamonds all in your ring
I'mma show you what I mean
Now we onto better things
Forever you and me
Neck good, extra sloppy
I'mma buy you a Masi
[Outro]
Eye, caught my eye
Baby, you caught my eye
Caught my eye
