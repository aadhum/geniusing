What you tryna do shawty, I’m a millionaire
I’m in Haiti, bitch I ain’t gon have no problems
I got rich nigga problems
I got issues, I got motherfucking problems
I got problems, I got rich nigga problems
Red bottoms, I bleed when I’m walking
At the age of 13 I was in and out of juvie
What you tryna do shawty, I’m a millionaire
I’m in Haiti, bitch I ain’t gon have no problems
I got rich nigga problems
I got issues, I got motherfucking problems
I got problems, I got rich nigga problems
Walking around with a fifty, Versace like Biggie
I’m richer than Diddy
The lean is killing my kidneys, Monefa she got to stay with me
What you tryna do shawty, I’m a millionaire
I’m in Haiti, bitch I ain’t gon have no problems
I got rich nigga problems
I got issues, I got motherfucking problems
I got problems, I got rich nigga problems
