Real trap niggas where the bands at
Real shooter nigga where your straps at
Let me see, Let me see, Let me see
Let me see, Let me see, Let me see
When you pull it out, gotta hold it real real low
No need to let the fucking feds see
You a trap nigga, where your bricks at, nigga?
You a shooter, nigga where your strap, nigga?
BOING BOING BOING, the Js annoying
You a trap nigga, where the bricks at, nigga?
Breakin' your bitch like a Kit-Kat, nigga
So nigga you can get you a whole key
Or nigga you can get you a OZ
Dodging the F-E-D
