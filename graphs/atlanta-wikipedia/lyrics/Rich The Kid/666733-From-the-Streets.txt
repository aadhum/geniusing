I got ice all over me
I got ice all over me
She wanna fuck, yeah cause of my diamonds
I ain’t finna buy the bitch red bottoms, she must be crazy.(Bitch you crazy!)
Shooters on shooters, ain’t saying no names
I got the gwalla just look at my ring
Put my wrist in the pot water whip with the watch, cause my motherfuckin’ rollie is a waterproof
Everything Vintage, you can not find it.
I ain't really worried bout nothing cause a nigga keep a chopper.(In the trap..trap..trap..)
Eating Busy B’s, Rich Nigga in the foreign I don’t need no key
I ain’t never been a fake watch busta.
Ridin’ round, sippin’ on lean. My chopper got an infrared beam
Trap gon’ Jump got fiends. Ain’t talkin bout Alicia, got keys
Rich the Kid, I’m from the street, Yeah I made it, so I got to thank Jesus
She gave me nothin’ but head, no Beavis.
Like French, I ain’t worried bout nothin’.
