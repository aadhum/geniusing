Wake up in the morning get paper
Money real long, got acres
Fuck it, we don't need no neighbors
Richer than a motherfuckin' mayor (I'M RICH!)
I'm livin' my life just like Diddy, I'm livin' like Diddy!
I'm livin' my life just like Diddy, I'm livin' like Diddy!
Livin' like Diddy, the king of my city
I ride in a masi I switch to the Bentley
I ride in a Audi I switch to the 'Rarri
Sippin' on lakers
Katrina call FEMA
Shoe grain safari
California
engine
This money is dirty, it's nasty
peasants
