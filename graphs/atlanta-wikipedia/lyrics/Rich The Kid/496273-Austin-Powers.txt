Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
Shizer
you gon' need a visor
In that Aston Martin and I’m crawling like a spider
Everything gold, I’m a gold member
Six rings on, I got gold fingers
My name is Austin Powers, 3 bitches in the shower
And they ready to get groovy, make a movie baby
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
Bitch make shawty crack, like they in the 80’s
Nigga living life just like Walter Payton
How many times have I told you that I would eat you like Denny's?
I took her out of the cheap shit
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
Garbage bag full of grass like I just mowed the lawn
Got a super plug, so I got super power
I feel like Austin Powers, real gangsters move in silence
I feel like MC Hammer, I can’t be touched
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
3 hoes in my bed like I’m Austin Powers
We gon get groovy, Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
3 hoes in my bed, like I’m Austin Powers
Austin Powers, Austin Powers
Bitch, my money stacked tall like the Eiffel Tower
