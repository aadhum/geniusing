I ain‘t worried bout shit, young nigga I’m rich
It’s fuck you, pay me
Don’t let your ho come around me
Imma take your lady (Imma take your bitch)
Riding round in the A
In the coupe going crazy [x5]
Maserati to Bugatti, a motherfucker start running from the paparazzi
You see the diamonds in my watch, it ain’t a G-Shock
Balenciaga on my feet this ain't no Reebok
I'm at the W, never ever been to the double tree
Gianni Versace,
I come to your city, take over like Nazi
I pass the OG stuffed crust cookie Snoop
Blood diamond came from Africa, call me Al-Farouq
You think I give a fuck about a bitch, I ain’t a sucker
Versace, Versace, my fabric
Counting money in the mansion, your girl in the living room dancing
And it don’t take nothing to drop her panties
Ain’t a damn thing changed, still serving the J’s
Felicia, she want to borrow my microwave
Deebo still in the hood, creeping through your window
I’m fucking Mrs. Parker, took her to Puerto Rico
Me, Craig, and Smokey smoke dope and we be choking
Which watch should I wear today, the heavy Breitling or the Rollie?
