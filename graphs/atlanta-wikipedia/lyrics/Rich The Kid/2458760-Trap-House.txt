(If you talkin' then I pull up to your momma house)
I'ma air it out
Free Gucci ridin' to that Chicken Talk
Crib has more TVs than Wal-Mart
Go ahead and teach me a lesson
Ain't touchin' a brick with no stamp
My diamonds they look like a lamp
I cut off a bitch like K Camp
Like Slime Nudy, I don't beef
Cut her off cause she a leach
I'm a savage I'm a beast
All this money, I'm obese
I ain't the Kid but I'm rich
In the 'Rari with a stick
I'ma dog, Michael Vick
I'ma dog, Michael Vick
They fuck 'round and hand me the torch
Smokin' gas look like Donatello
Zone 6 is a motherfuckin' hell hole
Drinkin' on Act', nigga fuck the yellow
Fuck a diss song, I'm lettin' shells go
I'm in Neimans, drop 100
