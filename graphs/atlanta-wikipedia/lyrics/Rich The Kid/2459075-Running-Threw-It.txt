She said that she fuck with the new me
I fuck that bitch in my coupe
Pouring the four, with a doobie
I was riding through the six
I got a trunk full of bricks
I got a robber no Chris
My foreign ain't got paper tags
Got a pool like I'm Drake
Got a mansion on a lake
Iâ€™m a juug servin' dummy
I'm a fiend for that money
