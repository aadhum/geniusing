Trap house jumping like Jeremy
And the trap house jumping like Jordan
Savages, savages, savages
"Dis Ain't What U Want" got a nigga on the map
No seatbelt but a nigga stay strap
Fuck who don't like us, 300 where it's at
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Take off on you niggas, Jeff Gordon
AP, it cost me fifty
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap house jumping like Jordan
Got the trap house jumping like Jordan
Trap house jumping like Jordan
Pulled up in the drop top phantom
Iâ€™m whipping at the whole grand canyon
My coca game is frantic
My whip game make you panic
My plug is Phil Jackson
Reginald
Dark skinned ho, cook up the dope, she look like Nestle
And the pyrex trap go crazy
Medusa my underwear
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter
