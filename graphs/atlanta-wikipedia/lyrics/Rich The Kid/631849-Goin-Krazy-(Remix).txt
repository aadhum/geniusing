It's YG 4 Hunnid
I'm in the coupe going brazy
No home training like my momma ain't raised me
I'm a hustler with customers
I sell dick to bitches, before I whip out they pay me
All I got is 4 minutes ho
I can't go broke got too many ways to get the dough
I'm bipolar when it comes to that cash flow
If rap don't work ima get out a bitch pussy or asshole
I'm in the coupe going brazy
Chucking up trees out the windows the enemies hate me
Bompton to Inglewood, the east side villa's good
Got niggas from the J
bitch im from every hood
I been fucking with Atlanta since Michael Vick
Been fucking with the A since the
She said damn, he ain't say nothing to me
Cause if I can't fuck you, then I don't speak, woop
