Young nigga smooth with the wrist [x12]
Wrist game, Wrist game
Young nigga in the kitchen made a mill with the wrist game
Fucking your bitch in that matte black
Taught her how to whip it in the kitchen
Made a come back
I was countin' up racks when they was sleepin' on me
Bankroll too big, can't put a rubber band on it
I could whip it with a motherfucking broke wrist
Had to come up to the plug for the whole brick
Young nigga smooth with the pot
I got 22 pigeons in the drop
They know I'm rich, but a nigga still trappin'
Diamonds on froze, like the South Pole
Gas bag
Gas bag
I know they watching, so I'm trappin' smarter
Gotta make love to the pot
Love to the pot
Gotta make love to the pot
Love to the pot
When you scrape the pot
Better not miss a spot
Boy you missed a spot
Made a lot of guap
Off my fucking wrist
I done took some risks
That made a nigga rich
Shout out my brother Rich
Shout out my brother Flip
My blood brother, man, man
Oh Lord, not again
Oh Lord, not again
I think I hurt my hand, man
I think I broke my wrist
Wrist, Wrist, Wrist
Yeah, I really whipped a brick
