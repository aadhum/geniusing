Hit it wit the remix, re-rock
No straight drop,
My diamonds is dancing
I pull up in Phantoms
I trap out a mansion
My bitches they come cross the border
They naked no bra or no panties
I fly with a fish & i fly with a fish
And I whip and I'm breaking my wrist
I'm sipping the Lakers
Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm rich, I don't give a damn
I just fucked a nigga baby momma off of Instagram
Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
The money is coming in an orderly fashion
Young nigga I'm capping and trapping
Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula
My nigga got choppers, berettas and uzis
I promise they'll damage ya
How does it feel to be broke?
White diamonds like coke
Chapo wit' the red beam
No Rockets I got Yao Mings
I'm speaking bilingual
I'm talking in spanish
Mota
coca'
Baking soda
Feeling like Pablo Escobar
Trapping in Louis V Loafers
So much got damn cash
I feel like a Bank of America broker
Got shooters wit me nigga
I thought I told ya
The game is not checkers it's chess
No spades it's poker
Mo bags then Krogers
White (Coca), bricks
Wrap 'em up, ship 'em out
My whole hood trap, my whole hood trap
Walk in the hood wit tha K's out
Tornado arms
Play wit the water like thunderstorm
I play with the bombs
So please do not call me Saddam
You bitch like my cum
So I skeet a lil bit on her tongue
Work in the trunk
Hunnids in the back
I ain't never seen hunnid racks look this flat
Blue benjis!
QC we winning
