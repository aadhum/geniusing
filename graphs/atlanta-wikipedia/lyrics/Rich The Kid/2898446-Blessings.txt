I had to learn a lesson
Lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing
Get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson
Lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing
Get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
Harley
I pull up in a i8, she blowin' up my i7
I had to learn a lesson
Lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing
Get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
I had to learn a lesson
Lose it all in a second
I made it here that's the blessing
Get the money not stressin'
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
You better count yo' blessings, you better count yo' blessings
