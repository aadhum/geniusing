My trap jumping, my spot bumping, my phone ringing
Quit playing, chopper on me right now
And my Rolex white like the White House
Imma fuck your bitch in the back of your Benz
And you can have your girlfriend
Dabbing in Loubotins
My trap jumping, my spot bumping, my phone ringing
5 rings, that’s 100 bands
Thank god I’m a rich nigga
Bitch I’ll never go broke again
You know it’s QC the chain
Foreigns they all in garage, diamonds they hitting like Floyd
My trap jumping, my spot bumping, my phone ringing
