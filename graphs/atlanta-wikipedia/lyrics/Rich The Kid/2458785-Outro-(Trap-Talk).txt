How to get a skateboard on the grind?
Look at my diamonds, go blind
Ain’t pick up no fork, you ain’t whippin'
Look what I did to the Sprite
Lil bitty
bitch want them bands
Lamb'
I'm flexin' with a Rollie, have no job
On the way to Miami on a jet
I'm a real savage like Offset
All this (?) all up in the 360
I had holes in my shoes, now the black card
