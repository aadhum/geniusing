It's Gucci!
All my young niggas!
Burr!
Woo! I'm rich!
[Hook x2: Rich The Kid]
Trap (x6)
All my young niggas
Trap (x4)
Hit it wit the remix, re-rock
No straight drop, my whole hood trap

[Verse 1: Rich The Kid]
My diamonds is dancing
I pull up in Phantoms
I trap out a mansion
My bitches they come cross the border
They naked no bra or no panties
I fly with a fish & i fly with a fish
And I whip and I'm breaking my wrist
My ice from the glacier
I'm sipping the Lakers
I'm rich like the mayor
Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm rich, I don't give a damn
I just fucked a nigga baby momma off of Instagram
Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
I don't even know how it happened
The money is coming in an orderly fashion
Young nigga I'm capping and trapping
Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula
My nigga got choppers, berettas and uzis
I promise they'll damage ya
Migo gang, pull up flexin' 30 chains
Lamb no brains, got it off of cocaine

[Hook]
Off the packs so quick pac hit me up then kick the shit intact
Zone 6 EA
[Hook]
