Bitch so bad but the pussy so good
Walking in the mall with a whole lot of bags
I'ma take you shopping
Want to ride like me, want to shine like me
I'ma buy you diamonds
Young rich nigga, I ain’t lying
Young rich nigga I ain’t lying, bitch take a look at these diamonds
Bitch wanted diamonds from Tiffanys
Young nigga had to grind for the cash
I swerve in the Masi, my haters is mad
I bought her a Rolex and took her to Jacobs
Sipping on Actavis, two cup
Bitch not mine like Maury
Diamonds they hitting like Bruce Lee
Putting 3 5 in the swishers
I’m smoking on nothing but OG gas
Bitch so bad but the pussy so good
Walking in the mall with a whole lot of bags
I'ma take you shopping
Want to ride like me, want to shine like me
I'ma buy you diamonds
Young rich nigga, I ain’t lying
Can’t put no ring on that finger
Look at my chain and your eyes are in danger
Got a bad bitch with a banger, always keep one in the chamber
She said she don’t fuck with the molly I know that shes taking a boot
Bitch so bad but the pussy so good
Walking in the mall with a whole lot of bags
I'ma take you shopping
Want to ride like me, want to shine like me
I'ma buy you diamonds
Young rich nigga, I ain’t lying
