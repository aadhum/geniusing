Racks!
I might pop a perc and just go crazy
Fucking on your bitch like I want babies
Leaning and tripping on two pills
Sippin' on pints of the double seal
They told me to stop but I'm sippin' still
Momma' said be patient
I had no Mercedes
I was on the block I trapped that rock, like back in the 80s
Just know that I pour up a whole pint
Like fuck it I'm back on the dirty Sprite
I'm catching the plays like Jerry Rice
My young niggas killing might take your life
Pull up in Porsche and it's all white
I'm all in her head like fucking lice
Play with the money you pay the price
need
adding
dab
I might pop a xan and just go lazy
I got all these bitches like I'm pimpin'
And your baby momma' now she drippin'
Walking around with a lot of cash
Rari' I ride with a paper tag
I got the molly and Katy
Bricks disappearing no magic
A whole lotta' racks cause I gotta have it
adding
dab
