I’ma jump in it like this
I don’t party with the kids
I get lit and I sit at the crib
You my baby, no bib
I’ma jump in it like this
All I want is the neck
Dive up in it, she wet
Woke up, dreaming ‘bout a TEC
She be my girl from the city
She got a body like Nicki
She put a scratch on the whip
Baby I'll fix it, no biggie
Gotta hit it two times
Gotta cuff her, it's a crime
Bust it open, now it's mine
Put my life up on the line
Swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin'
I roller coaster through the women
They lay their back up on the linen
Yo me and Richy 'bout to get it
They ain't even see it coming
I was broke, turned nothing to something
Maserati in my pocket, just stuntin'
Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin
Trappin' out a mansion
Made a million dollars, now my diamonds dancing
I was thinkin' 'bout a check
Rich forever, got a deal
Motherfuck how you feel
Fucking a ho out in Calabasas
Why they want to see me broke
Took your bitch and now she broke
Doors go up on the Tesla
Young nigga, I flex like a wrestler
I get geeked like professors
I get head in the Bentley
Ridin' 'round with a semi
I got cheese like the dentist
I'ma jump in it like this
I'ma go- I'ma go dive in a bitch
I'm finally rich
Want a model, take a pick
I’ma jump in it like this
I don’t party with the kids
I get lit and I sit at the crib
You my baby, no bib
I’ma jump in it like this
All I want is the neck
Dive up in it, she wet
Woke up, dreaming ‘bout a TEC
She be my girl from the city
She got a body like Nicki
She put a scratch on the whip
Baby I'll fix it, no biggie
Gotta hit it two times
Gotta cuff her, it's a crime
Bust it open, now it's mine
Put my life up on the line
Swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin'
I roller coaster through the women
They lay their back up on the linen
Yo me and Richy 'bout to get it
They ain't even see it coming
I was broke, turned nothing to something
Maserati in my pocket, just stuntin'
Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin
Let me hit it, let me hit it
I can't cuff her, let me flip it
I'ma pass the ho to Jaden
This Chanel, no Lacoste
I'ma flex like fuck the cost
Hit from the back then she suck it
She call me daddy, I'm bussin'
Me and Jaden on the hills
Skateboarding, shit for real
I’ma jump in it like this
I don’t party with the kids
I get lit and I sit at the crib
You my baby, no bib
I’ma jump in it like this
All I want is the neck
Dive up in it, she wet
Woke up, dreaming ‘bout a TEC
She be my girl from the city
She got a body like Nicki
She put a scratch on the whip
Baby I'll fix it, no biggie
Gotta hit it two times
Gotta cuff her, it's a crime
Bust it open, now it's mine
Put my life up on the line
Swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin', I'm swimmin'

They lay their back up on the linen
Yo me and Richy 'bout to get it
They ain't even see it coming

Maserati in my pocket, just stuntin'
Let me hit it, change my name to McLovin
