Was raised in the streets, I barely seen my mother
Young rich nigga came from the very bottom
I ain’t have no choice, all I knew was robbing
Bitch nigga I ain’t finna starve
Had to rob, I ain’t have no job
Was raised in the streets, I barely seen my mother
Was raised in the streets, I barely seen my mother
