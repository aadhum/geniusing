I got a bank all of bags
She wanna fuck for a bag
I was in the trap fuck class
I had an A in math
Look at my finger the glass
I bought the bitch a new ass
Flexing around with the cash
Rollie watch, Goyard
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
I need a brand new foreign
Bad bitch pullin' up with my cheddar
Strap on me like I had a Beretta
I was broke but made it happen
disappearin' like magic
choppper
In love with the money we marry
Wet you up like a Squirtle
I got a bank all of bags
She wanna fuck for a bag
Look at my finger the glass
Rollie watch, Goyard
Ain't lovin' these bitches, a cold heart
Bobby's
Hard to kill call me Steven Seagal
Wait, I'm off the flats, fuck the bars
Never leave home without my 40, might get you
Bullets hit you like ketchup
And make you dance like Step Up
I got a bank all of bags
Look at my finger the glass
Rollie watch, Goyard
Rollie watch, Goyard
