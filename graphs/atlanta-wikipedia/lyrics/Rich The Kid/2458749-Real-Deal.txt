Percocet, pop a pill
You was talkin' to the 12
I don't really fuck with atheists
Crosses on my neck, I'm bankin' it
Skippa got the chopper, aimin' it
And we ain't shootin' at your legs
And we ain't shootin' at the pancreas
QC, the label dangerous
Real gold, ice grill
Three grams in my wood
And Yeezy's on, check the weather
I'm goin' through it so I pour away
