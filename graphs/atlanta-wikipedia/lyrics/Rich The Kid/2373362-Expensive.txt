I was trapping I was lying to my mama
Niggas hating I was looking for a come up
What would you do for a rollie a bust down
The price of the fame is too much now
Real niggas they'll die about respect
Back then I was broke now I flex
Pull up in a Bentley or Maybach
The rari I ride in Miami
I promise you won't understand me
medal
Model bitch only eat rice
I need a guy have a master plan
[?] came till tomorrow
