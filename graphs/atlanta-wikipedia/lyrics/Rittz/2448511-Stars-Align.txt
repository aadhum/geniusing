Fly as fuck or scared of heights or aviation
Uneducated but I ain't dumb, paint shinin' on my Cutlass
She's my pride and joy like Stevie Ray Vaughan
Got ho inside em', they should go apply at Avon
And those the type of guys I try to stay away from, they be too lame,
but they say they keep it A1
I bet I lay one
Out across the pave-ment
I feel like I should listen, now I'm wishin' that I didn't
I would
[?]
Black hoodie but the fabric's made of leather
Looking fresh like I was Fred Astaire, with a better head of hair
With no fedora on, fuck is going on?
Mike was cooking up the beat, he hung his apron up
But everybody's looking for something like Annie Lennox
Higher than Bob Ross, watch me while I paint the canvas
you oughta know, shout out Alanis
Morrissette
You must've been born deaf, really you can't be serious
You making Silkk the Shocker sound like he's the greatest lyricist
That ever lived, that's not a diss, I'm just comparing them
