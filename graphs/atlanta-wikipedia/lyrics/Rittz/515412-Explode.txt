You sleepin' on me then that's your loss
The shit I hear you listening to the type of music that I’m bored of
Some of you dumber than a door knob
"Blowjob Betty" I’ll be in my super sport bumping short dog
Old-school even if I could afford a sports car
Throwing up the north still reppin Lawrenceville and Norcross
Lilburn, still burn, still on that pure soft
Paint a visual got the skill of a Warhol
With my lady she was down when I was broke so I would never go and leave her for a stripper or a porn star
Fuck a judge and his scorecard
Your magazine don’t cover me your company been doing a poor job
I’ve been going hard in Atlanta since the 90s motherfucker now you finally want to try to get on board nah
My goal is so close I'm focused
This Journey's been like a roller coaster of broken roads
Back when I was broke and hopeless
And hoes would look at me like I was gross, repulsive
Now they’re showing up the shows with posters
Posing naked and posting pictures, it got me mixed with emotions
Listen to my flow and under go hypnosis
Snakes crawling all around me seeing boahs, cobras
Sick of penny pinching like I’m trying to hold some roach clips
