Cameras flashing
Spot lights getting hot on me like
Turn this suntan to ashes
And you cannot match it
I done blew up
And covered the competition in volcanic ashes
Let us
the
a plus
Yelawolf changed my life so much it chokes me up
You talk about me when I was broke and
He gave me the hope I lost
And now I'm gone on the road so much
And I know you're lonely love
I just wish we could touch through the phone but just
Stay focused and note that I'm trying to make a living for the both of us
I might close enough to finally buy us a car
shy town
I'm a give you the life you deserve one day
While you crying all alone in our bed
I'm on the bus and the bunk
Having dreams barbequing with a back yard for the dog to run
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now your love just seems so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
Fights on facebook
All you see these pics they took with me
You can't believe the hype
Every night we fight about girls you see
On the internet, thinking I'm cheating
And I gotta defend myself from bullshit you accused me
Losing you is the last thing I want
on
Cause I've been thinking about you all day
And I've been walking down this hallway
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
And every day my heart aches
I'm just sitting in this dark place
And now you love to see so far away
But maybe that's the way it's always gon be
