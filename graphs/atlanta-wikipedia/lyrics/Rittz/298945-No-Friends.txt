I'm even havin trouble trustin kin
Shit, I ain't spot no tens
Hang around when you got no bens
Mothafuckas sayin we been tight
But there they go hatin again
I'm a loner
Then they take my kindness and confuse it with weakness
And mothafuckas only come around me hopin they can benifit
Dick ridin everyone i introduce them to
Like "fuck rittz i do music too"
Embarassin me when they look and im like "Who is you?"
Im finally cuttin my ties with everybody that corruptin my life
