I'm just a kid from the G.C
Who would've thought you would see me
On MTV one day, I done came a long way from printing up CDs
cameras
Now I'm doing shit in the House of Blues in LA
dry egg stakes
They like, "Hey, would you please sign my ladies tits?"
I'm like, fine
You can touch them Rittz I don't mind
I say congratulations on your ladies tits
You got pics donâ€™t put em online
Cause my girl might trip out
Me and her we done had a hard time
7 years we ain't never had a dime
Even though it ain't much it, I feel like I'm getting rich now
I just signed a deal so I'm a get it now
I told Tech and Trav I won't let them down
It's an honor to be a part of Strange Music
A label that's down to go to the extra mile
And I could crack a smile without faking it
Cause a few people knew me in the A
Now I got dudes over in the UK
They getting tattoos of my face they know me all...
All around the world
All around the world
They know me all around the world
All around the world
Shit over heated in Tennessee
Hundred degree weather stranded by Ruby Falls
Danny Boone
Demun Jones
Help me expand my fan base
We done stayed in some shitty hotels
Sleeping on top of the covers, wearing socks in the showers
Opening for rehab again
Burn One
drinking crown
I was just a kid in Gwinnett with a dream
Tryna' be like Dre and Big Boi
I just bought a new car and shit
we start the but
Shortcut name Rittz and kids named me White Jesus
Look what you started bro that's love
