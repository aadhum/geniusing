All of sudden murder wasn't so uncommon
Before we quit high school, selling drugs was cool
But drugs took a toll on her pretty face
That along with hard times combined
Anyway I hope you rocked a rubber
If you fucked her though
Cause shit gets thick like the fur on the neck of a buffalo
When you piss and your dickhead hurts
But you gotta let it burn like an Usher song
We was young and dumb and full of bad ideas (bad ideas)
So for the past five years (past five years)
I be looking back like, "Shit! How the fuck I make it?"
