knot
squad's squat
I've been given carte blanche
Riding Beaver Ruin I just rode this shit from 29 on Buford Highway
Smokin out from Berkmar High to Norcross
I bet if these police they see me
They gonna pull me over just because, watch
Bumping Jazzy Belle and Extraterrestrial
Catchin' feelings bet you if I met you you gon' let me drill
Like a Craftsman or Black and Decker
have screwed
have
Plus up
food, he
That had the superfriends
menage
It's just another day in her life
with Don Shula
I can coach you how to move like a maneuver
aid I do the kool and fuck if you a goon or you a shooter
Dacula
tool
Bitches try to lay me like they met me at a luau
