[Chorus: Poe]
Jonny, Angry Jonny...
This is Jezebel in Hell
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
I wanna kill you
I wanna blow you, away
You changed so much over the years it's like there's barely a resemblance
Of who we used to be, I never thought that you'd be physically abusin'
I wish I knew how bad your temper was
I caught you cheatin' on me once but I was scared to leave
I can't believe I told you yes when you said "marry me"
