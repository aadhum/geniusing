I'mma head turner
People wanna sweat me I just let 'em stare
Disrespect me and I'll check 'em like a questionnaire
Yeah, Gwinnett's in here, so bring the sireens
Cause we in the club rollin' up some sticky lime green
High beam spot
Light is mine for the time bein'
On a murder, rappers turn a track into a crime scene
Ridin' dirty, no I'm not referring to my hygiene
No sir, brushin' my shoulder there's no dirt, no
I'm so fly that I should be stylin' in a fur coat
Oh, my pinky is twinkling, I let it radiate
Two step n' snappin' in the pattern leather bathin' apes
Some 808's, boomin' like a cannon ball
I ain't knockin' where you from but this is how we do it in Atlanta dawg
Purple herb
xanny bars
rollin' on them hard drugs
Splurgin' in a fancy car, survin' on the hush hush
In the club buzzed like a yellow jacket
And we can get those cigarillos crackin'
A b-bread burner
770 is where I'm reppin' you better let 'em know
Where they be lettin' them o's go for the extra low
I'mma let what I gross grow till I get it sold
'til my necklace is rose gold with those precious stones
Let it show
I used to flex and my bread was low bro
Stretchin' dough, I ain't talkin' pretzels and crescent rolls
But now there's several O's in front of the decimals
So every ho that knows it approaches me sexual
Where them gold diggers at
Probably at the club sittin' on a go-getter's lap
JÃ¤gerbombs
Redheaded Sluts
Or in the Chevy with the red leather guts gettin' some cut
And I'mma beat it and butcher it
Teasin' her with the green that she couldn't get
Ain't nobody else in the county fuckin' around with us
