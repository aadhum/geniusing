loss
But they ain't really mad 'cause I don't call no more
They just jealous of the squad on tour
Cause when they really get to know me, solely
They wanna hold me, hopin' that we grow ta be oldies
In Holy matrimony, snatch a Brodie
From rap, the road, see a sad emoji
Cause that will never happen, I'll be forever rappin
That ain't love, walk around the club and fuck everybody
