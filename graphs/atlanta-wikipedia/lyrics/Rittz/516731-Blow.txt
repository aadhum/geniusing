I just got some drank, I just hit some herb
Took a couple shots, instantly I got the urge
I called my homie’s phone, he asked me where I am
I told him I’m at the crib, come thru and bring a couple grams
This ain’t every day, this ain’t once a week
But sometimes when I get drunk, all I wanna do is geek
So we started snorting lines, when it drained it tasted sweet
You could tell that shit was good, my mouth was crooked trying to speak
Chillin’ with my homie: me, him, and my girl
When we’re on that cocaine, it’s us against the world
Did 1 line, 2 line, 3 lines, 4 lines, 5 lines in a row
My hands are gettin’ clammy, it’s fuckin’ up my nose
Blow (blow), oh shit
I be on that blow, and I said I’m gon’ quit
I’m fucked up on that blow (blow), oh shit
And I really hope I don’t end up overdosing
This blow will make you talk, drinking while we chat
Talking bout our problems, yapping about the past
But that shit is a secret if anybody asks
Trying to come down with them Xanax, we’re popping Lortabs
Last time we was high, my girl done spilled her glass
The coke was on the table, that drink got in the bag
So we started freaking out cause that was all we had
We tried to microwave it, had to throw it in the trash
Seven in the morning, starting to  see the sun
Got one more line left, one a piece until it’s done
I pick up a CD case and spill that shit cause I was drunk
But instead of saying fuck it, tried to snort it off the rug
