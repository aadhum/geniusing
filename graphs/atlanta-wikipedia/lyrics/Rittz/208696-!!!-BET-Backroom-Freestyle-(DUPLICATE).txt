Juyeah
Live from the backroom,
baboon
I'm an animal
I blow like boom
Every lyric that you hear feeling like a stab wound
Get your nose broke, get your eyes black, raccoon
85 North
A-town
homie we ain't riding skateboards
hit a lick
Rapping for the underground until im in a graveyard
got soul like im BB King
a rock star like im B. Springsteen
Its The Life and Times of Jonny Valiant
Strange Music,
Slumerican,
Northside A-town
