[Hook]
These motherfuckers make me laugh
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Look at how they dress
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Listen how they rap
They L-A-F, they Lame As Fuck
Trying to say they fresh, trying to say they tough
You ain't ever been about it, you just make shit up
You lame as fuck
You ain't spittin' and your music don't jam
Try to study me like I'm a student exam
Hard for me to take a lyricist serious
Especially a dude in sweatpants wearing unisex Vans
What was you expecting, made a song 'Fuck Swag' and
A.K.A Mr. Make-'em-Wanna-Rewrite
These guys get a feature from me study me on every record
Then they switch they whole style up
Homie I can see right through it
You ain't never used to chop like that
Now you talk about your girl and your struggle
Tryin' to get it, how you did a lot of soft
How you're pissed off at your boss
You ain't used to have the same 9 to 5 I had
Need to find your own lane, you and I might crash
Rap game looking like Revenge of the Nerds
And ya pants and ya shirt too tight, is that plaid?
With your lame ass socks showing, stop trolling
Going online posing with your Glock showing
You ain't never shot no one, stop lying you are not blowing
Comment under my photos bout the way that I look
I bet that I could get your lady to fuck
And suck dick, quicker than you
You said the two of you was in love
You're lame as fuck and I bet that you the type of dude to come up
And tell me that I look familiar, knowing damn well ya
Seen my videos and know my name and it would kill ya
Not to be lame so instead I gotta tell ya
Washed up rappers acting like I owe 'em something
When I needed them before I made it, they would never help ya
Lame ass homies wanna party at my crib
So they can drink up all my liquor they don’t ever buy they-self none
Lame ass bitches insecure and distorted
She tried shave her head on some Cassie shit
Now she thinkin’ she gorgeous
A lot of people in my city try to say that they relate to me
But still so many in Atlanta don’t appreciate a thing
I did or even heard of me
Its almost like they trained to be a slave to what they playin’ on the radio
They proceed to put me in a cage because my record label Strange
They need to listen, if they did they'd probably end up devastated
We don’t play, we put the music business in a Strangeulation
Other record labels lame to me, these motherfuckers L-A-F
They be actin’ like we cooler than we are
If I met you doing music, don’t be stupid, this a job
You are not a friend of mine, just a dude I never call
Bombing on 'em, Shock and Awe
