Fake smile on my face, feeling suicidal, safety off of my gun
Can't tell it was real or a cry for help but I feel like if I don't make one
The doc said if I keep drinking Coke and Crown, I won't make it to see 38
Then I'm wasted again on the floor in the hotel room
With puke stains on the drapes and the carpet
Gotta call at eight o'clock in the morning
Said my boy took the keys to my car and drove it through the front door of an Exxon and
Cops came and, locked him up, they said they had a warrant
Now I'm spending all my tour money on his lawyer
Lord if, this is you sending us a warning
I hear it loud and clear and please God I swear
I won't ignore it anymore
He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
But one day when the rain is gone
The thunder from the storm rolls on
I woke up and I seen the sun and it shine right
And it feels like
Euphoria
Some kid just said that they in to me
And told me everything I rap about
Feel like it happened to him identically
Im tryna rap and I'm flunkin' school
The only thing I really care about in this world
Is my girl and she been fucking with another dude
and he blackened it bad
When you feel like you sitting at the bottom; You not
To get better, shit gets worse first
He told me when it rains it pours
And I can hear the pouring rain
to push the rush
