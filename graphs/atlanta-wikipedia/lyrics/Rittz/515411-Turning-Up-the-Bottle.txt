Everything is bad, but it all seems OK
When we're turning up the bottle
Trying to see the sun but the sky seems so gray
Drowning in our sorrow
Oh, oh, o-oh
Turning up the bottle
Oh, oh, o-oh
Drowning in our sorrow
Now they can drink without a conscience, no one was there to tell them it was time to grow up
Plus the color of her skin and eyes had turned a tone of yellow
Indicating that she may have got cirrhosis of the liver or maybe hepatitis
told her not to drink a lick of liquor
But she never listens, turning up that bottleâ€¦
