[Verse 1]
See Jonny says that life is overrated
He says that every day is so monotonous he hate it
He's had a 9 to 5 since '99 and he don't make shit
He lying on his applications saying he graduated
And he blame it on his parents back in the day they separated
Sedated on you name it but it made him feel creative
[Verse 2]
