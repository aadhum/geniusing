It's a problem when you
Can't afford to eat shit but a double cheese from the dollar menu
Gotta pay in quarters
Bitch behind the window pissed she sick of taking orders
Shit aren't we all
Ridin round on E waitin for the car to stall
With a engine cut chick lookin in the mirror puttin on lipstick wishin that she lookin like a barbie doll
Infatuated with all the stars in hollywood wanna wear what the rappers wore
Buy shoes that you can't afford
With no gas in your car to go to the package store to get a pint of martins
Wishin you could drink ciroc
I had a brand new watch that didn't turn your wrist green its not cool to shop at K-Mart
The Girls all think you twat
You start hustlin n bumpin
You was movin and end up getting pop'ed
And now you locked up
Pacin and Facin time
Every time you call home your lady cryin
Talk about her period late and I'm pregnant no you ain't what you think I'm blind
The doc say It's a boy we gon name him Brian
He said first we gon make sure the baby mine
I know you out there fuckin bitch thinks I'm blind
Holdin' to the scars
He said that he fell in love with some stupid bitch in one month she was movin in
All she wanted was to have some kids
And a husband, love and happiness
Sayin' where does a life like that exist?
No family, she ain't seen daddy since she came out the womb with a bunch of bastard kids
who got dissed with the disadvantages
So the optimism vanishes
Made a wish when she lit the candle stick
I appreciate you
I don't wanna seem like I'm being ungrateful
I'm lucky that I'm livin I ain't been no angel
Need some medication or at least some love
My boyfriends cheatin, he beats me up
Please God forgive
In the name of Jesus I pray Amen
She hit the chittle again cause that's all she know
