Check it out we taking shots, posted up
Drinking that Crown we toasting cups
we elevated
Slick brought the pills Rowdy Bizzle brought the white
When I mix em' it's a feeling that I can't describe
But I guess I'll give my best to try
Daily shit can get too heavy to carry so every now and then my body needs the opposite of exercise
So I pull the plastic wrapper off the cap of my
Crown Royal bottle
somewhere in Gwinnett you'll find me
Cause we ain't trippin' on the past or the afterlife
This ain't no champagne, they already know what's in my drank
I pull that crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
Crown up outta that purple bag
That purple bag
We've been turned up all day long, long day off
We gon' drink until the alcohol is gone
Neighbors saying that they're going to call the law
I ain't tripping on that blas√© blah
Playing music loud as fuck and the house is a cloud of smoke
These hoes be showing titties like they been at Mardis Gras
Her song came on I guess that's when her bra came off
We gon' party all night like we got insomnia
