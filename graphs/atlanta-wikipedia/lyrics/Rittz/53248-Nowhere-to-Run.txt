[Hook]
I want to run away
Because I know there's got to be a better place
Sometimes I really want to run away
But the more I try the more I can't escape
Because there ain't nowhere to run
Instead I'm drunk, praying to the Lord
Saying, "Here I come,"
Sitting on my bed with a loaded gun
Pointed at my head
And then my girlfriend screams put the gun away
I told her love just saved the day
Let's pack our stuff and run away
From all this bullshit
Man I hate my life, my job, I feel like my days is awful
Working nine to five
but give her five to eleven
Limping in my front door looking tired and sweating
Last thing I feel like doing is going and writing a record
My fuckin' socks are soaking wet, my girl gotta go to bed
These opposite schedules getting harder to manage
Working in a kitchen with a bunch of Mexicans
And I swear these motherfuckers talk about me in Spanish
My only plan was to make it rapping
After so long you start thinking if this shit was meant to be it'd happen
If it wasn't for my homie Yelawolf believin' in me
I'd probably still be feeling like my dream was shattered
Cause my team is scattered, but now I got a second chance
And it's time to get the fire back
At a young age, I done developed so many bad habits
I feel like I'mma have to snort a line to even try to write a rap
On top of that I can't afford the power bill
Rappin' ain't payin'; makin' nine dollars an hour still
Can't afford to have a kid, can't afford to put my girl on the pill
Plus I hate the way a condom feel
How's your family feel 'bout your music 'bout your numbers?
Y'all they said that it was dumb and never gave a shit
I be smilin' now, when they tell me they proud
But then the climate turn around and say some racist shit
So it's strainin' my relationship
I told my girl I need her; I'd never leave her if I made it big
One day I want to marry you and raise a kid
Gone all night long but I ain't chasin' chicks
I just missed another show cause I gotta work
If I try to request any more days off
Then my boss gon' fire me
He said he's tired of me tryin' him
I wanna tell him to go fuck himself
But I know ain't nobody hirin'
Besides I'm twenty-nine, my future's on the line
Doing drugs made it easy to accept
That I settled getting used to, having nada
Can't afford Crown, so I'm sippin' on McCormick's
Tryin' to write a rap, but I can't think of a chorus
Wolf
scanning the
sick of kissing ass
So I pour another shot, trying to calm me some
Alcohol really can't resolve it none
Still pissed off, thinking everyone is dumb
Because I don't give a fuck what team LeBron is on
But they can look up and I'll be gone
