So many celebs that live in Gwinnett
Tryna say Downtown when they tell you where they from
Me, I'm from the 'burbs, never had much, I'm -
White boy in black Hollywood representing Slum
I'm incredible like Burt Wonderstone
Middle finger up saying fuck Paul Blart
[Verse 2: Rittz]
Dooly State Prison
My lawyer's suppressing the evidence
I had some dope in my residence
I had some guns in my residence
I would not tell on no Mexican, I would not tell on no Mexican!
