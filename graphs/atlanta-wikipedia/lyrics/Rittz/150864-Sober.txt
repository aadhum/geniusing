The city is glamming
In the spot coming from my gucci lenses
I ain't used to this I came through the trenches
Now my cousin fill up on boots and end em
Now I give all my hommies all my hand me downs
Shit I used to get a hundred bucks a show
Now I get a couple grand to come and stand around
And drink shots of crown
One too many gotta catch some air
Rooftop parties bars everywhere
Late night bunch of hoes at my doorway
It's 4 in the morning and the party don't end
Baby come over, baby come over
Our clothes on the ground drinking Crown till we spin
Fuck till we're sober
go in
Have my iphone out making homemade porn
And she screaming oh Lord, like she born again
One of us going down on snorkeling
Lying cause your really bout an eight and a half
But a head game is the greatest I had
Bet it was a blast she was making the splash
Can I put a little bit cocaine on your ass
[Verse 3: Suga Free]
I'm feeling like a rabbit coming out of the egg
Feeling like a motherfucker breaking down record my tool
The nerve of this nigga with a flat on glove
Hella body with a bounce this is pimpin ho
Polished, Groomed! shake with a fine grim
And buffed out to a shine that’ll blind a bitch, don’t I walk like I Got I all down to a science bitch
Kinda like domino's pizza
And don't get too comfortable in the morning
Money always feel better than sex to me
The trick if I pick it up and ask for free
Motherfucker flamboyant
And the sound of Sade
jamma bitch which fills my pocket
I like to wiggle wiggle it more I'm a hustler
Walk around pimpin' I don't touch 'em
I thought you knew that pimps don't go to jail
For pimpin', they go for mispimpin'
So don't do that...
And understand God made pimps so a ho can have a man
And a trick won't understand
