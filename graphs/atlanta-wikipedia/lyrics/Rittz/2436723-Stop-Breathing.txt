Thinking 'bout sticking me, you sort of unfortunate
Cause I be ready for you when you and your boys run up
Poor son of a bitch, give us a board at the morgue
Fuck it though cause I was broke up rollin' up
Hopin' we gone get through the storm comin'
Fuck around lose a limb, nigga saw me
You about to get everything you said you ever wanted, literally finna blow up
I don’t rap like them, I don’t play that way
And I don’t wanna fan out, looking for a hand out
Or acting like an idiot because I wanna stand out
Drop without warning, I’m neighborhood watch
They suffocatin' and heading for peristalsis
Never forget about Eric Garner, I can't breathe
