What bitch all of a sudden I’m attractive?
As if, last year you would laugh if I asked you out
All high and mighty in your cap and gown
She’d say it’s a disaster
While she tries to figure out my facebook password
And I ain't even doin shit
She liked it better when I had a job watchin time waste away
