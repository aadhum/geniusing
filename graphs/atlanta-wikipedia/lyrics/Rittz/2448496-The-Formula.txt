Yeah
Nobody fucking with us
Rittz up in this bitch, when I spit I'm a warrior
Still got that Crown Royal in my cup, 'bout to pour it up
From the second that I connected with Tech
Killin' a beat for Seven's effortless
Nobody - I'm just resurrecting Keith Sweat for the heck of it
I keep rushin' up the field like
Emmitt Smith
Cocky like a boxing champ
Savage like I'm Macho Man
Hola, que pasa guey?
Fuck around and now you lost a leg
And now you look like Drake in his Degrassi days
Crippled
lame as fuck
You a cartoon drawer, motherfucker I'm Picasso
Xannie bar,
coming harder than Lamar inside a brothel
Simply miss, another Caribou, where the Lou?
Missou is the truest
Bickin' it back
cheddarrun
'bout the bread Iâ€™m makin'
That I made and never gave it yo where the heck is they been?
Dishonorable when they hate the Snake and Bat logo upon the coat
Gassin' like conoco
You should prolly think about it 'fore you get up and you
Doubt it 'bout the pen game, definitely insane
Hook
At first, So Dope
she wanna off
Jonny and Donnie, we get money, no illuminati
[?]
They can stand back cause Sam going ham sandwich
When we chop, it's kinda hard to understand we be
Speaking like a foreigner, maybe it's the formula
[Hook]
