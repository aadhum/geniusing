Waiting on my Xanax to dissolve
Eat a bar just to go on stage
On the “Slumerican Made Tour” last Fall
On that Blow, and I know you heard that song
That was me the whole tour
When I got home, I was so embarrassed
Had me feelin' like I need to call - Wolf
And say “Sorry” for bein' so obnoxious
Just say no!
Up at Whistler center
Why your nose is the size of Gonzo's
Just say no!
