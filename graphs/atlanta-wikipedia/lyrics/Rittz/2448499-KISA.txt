never really
lot, no matter what she bought
Beneath the surface was a girl in search of true love, she's a queen that deserves to be crowned
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
And you can find me
We both used to be heavy into drugs, until we finally got each other clean
Used to fuck on a hand-me down twin bed, now we make love on a California King
Had to share a car, working double shifts, Christmas came around, couldn't buy each other gifts
Summertime couldn't turn on the A/C, Fan's blowin in our face while we eating frozen fish
Had to go and pretend like we had our own place
Saving up to stay up in a cheap motel
Now we got a two car garage, three cars, a big house, paying bills we don't need no help
65 inch T.V., she don't care about no money, she just love me, and I feel the same for her
Told her she don't gotta work, kick your feet up
She's just about to get the life she deserve
Together we gon' fight through all your problems
Until they all go away
We're both so crazy, 10 years in never lost attraction
I pulled a David Blaine inside the bed, never lost the magic
