Nine deuce was the year my ears got introduced to rap
Stealing instrumentals off singles, I’d use the tracks
MC Pooh, Mellow Man, and Jeru the Damaja
"Tears" from the King  and I, was the few I had
Practiced in my room for hours, improved my craft
Bought every artist's album that I heard
On the song, "Bring It On", number fourteen
Till death do us part
Wishing that I was from the 5th ward of Houston bad
A white kid from the burbs, bumping
5th Ward boys
Too much trouble and Seag that Odd Squad Cassette
Up in class rapping bum stiggity bum, giggity gangsta gangsta
Biting Spice 1 and
Das EFX
Kriss Kross and Method, Redman in my headphones
Blasting "Time Time 4 Sum Aksion"
The bell rang, start a cypher in the bathroom
to grow, the talent show, I rocked the vest like Treach
Miami Hurricane hat while I held the mic
Haters talking shit like who, this fake Vanilla Ice
And I don’t care if he’s nice, on my life
I don’t like no white rappers
31, I would go out and perform
Open mics, where no one’s white
Almost quit and when I did got introduced to the guy
That put me on, and he'd been through the same struggle as I
A white rapper
Now the rap game is flooded with rappers
From every nationality, a ton of them crackers
The fact that I finally came up is miraculous
My album is on the rack at Best Buy
I was at the BET awards, I was sitting right next ta
Luda and Rick Ross, but who woulda thought
I was just at Jim & Nick's, flipping chicken tenders and French fries
I used to hate when people asked me what I do for a living
It feels great to tell em you’re a musician
Until they ask what type of music, I tell 'em I rap
Then they laugh, looking at me, they be like "who are you kidding?"
I be like "Google me bitch,"
They always compare us white boys to one another
"Is your music like his?"
Even though a part of me agrees with Lord Jamar
We are guests in hip hop, I’m appreciative
That you finally let us in the crib
But I busted my ass to get respect for my craft
In interviews they never forget to mention this
That I’m just a white rapper
