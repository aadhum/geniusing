Driving Cadillacs through the ATL
Trying to make it to Heaven
So I'm going through Hell
Nobody knows my pain
So my cup is full
burning packs of ports
Hoping the weed gives me relief
Try to envision the future but how can I possibly succeed
My dreams are bleak, I need to go to church
Hate when people preach, faithfully believe in Jesus
Recently The Devil won't leave me be
My lady just told me she pregnant and begging that we can keep The baby that she conceived
I wouldn't consider it, told her we got to get rid of it
Why are you tripping and acting like you don't remember what we agreed
Was thinking about myself, selfish and overwhelmed
I just paid to kill my unborn child
The guilt was setting in, I felt like filth
There's people picketing outside this building
Saying I'm going to Hell
But shit will come to pass, sippin' bumping Kast
