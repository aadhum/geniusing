Welcome to the Jonny Valiant show
I'm about to blow
Independent with a hundred thousand albums sold
You ain't ever heard of me, fuck it now you know
Saying nothing, making noise with your mouth like you're out of road
Never seen an ounce of blow, flexin' like you Al Capone
So we can seek to sneak the brownie a la mode
Pocket full of bread, I ain't counting sour dough
Got reversed, when it was him, they never said, "Look out below"
With no balance in my bank account, and just a couple 'O's
If you don't start shit, there won't be none
They all went ghost on me
Ain't nobody coming close to me
It's like a goddamn ghost story
Your stage show is hard for me to look at
Like the unibrow on Al B. Sure!
The difference between our music's night and day
Beat 'em down and settle out at court
I'm starving like the Army was in Valley Forge
When all these artists talk like they the hottest and y'all
They don't get away with murder
distract
The fact,
thicker shit that's
I'm on another planet and these rappers I'm on Saturn, Mars
we the C-N-T
An open casket, I just killed a Kato track
If you feel it, play it back
