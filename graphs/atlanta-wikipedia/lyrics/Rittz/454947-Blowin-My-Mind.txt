You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
I may be out in Norcross, maybe up in Lawrenceville
see me partying on Beach Street
Looking Japanese cause I been smoking on that green green
Sniffing shit like porn stars, partying like animals
I drink then I pop more bars
At night I pop a couple Adderalls
Fuck her to the rhythm of the 808 bass
You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
Bumping DJ Burn One
Got candy on the outside
but the leather in it’s cocaine white
My 15’s kicking down the street like it’s a stampede
Waving at some bitches that I seen up in the Grand Prix
smoking with the windows up
Accelerated on the pedal and I fishtailed
You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
Showing off, gold flakes in the paint job
I make motherfuckers bite like crocodiles
Go ahead jock my style
It’s all good, it’s impossible to be me
Jonny Valiant, white bitch with me got titties like Foxy Brown
So when they see me at the red light, you can see her head lights
I ain’t talking bout the European front four
Smoke another like a locomotive does
You can find me riding 85 north for the A
Where the bitches fuck for riches and they see me getting paid
And the ladies they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
And these bitches they be blowing my mind (my mind my mind)
