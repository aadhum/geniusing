Don't know what day it is
Every day is the same on tour
Not sure what state I'm in
But I woke up in Missouri
Holla to the homie Abnorm
Got the bars and the perks, got the white if its norm
Fans give me free weed as a gift but I'd rather have some yay instead
I ain't even fucking with these hoes
I be cutting out the blow, oh shit, now there isn't any left
I get drunk and I be cooking shit like I'm a chef
You don't wanna sit down there's a wet -
Spot from a thot that somebody must've brought on the bus
What the fuck? It was red?
All night I'm (x9)
