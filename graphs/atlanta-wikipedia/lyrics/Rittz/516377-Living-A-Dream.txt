My shades more expensive than your J's
My chain indicates that I'm paid
My lady say it's time to get engaged
She say I go on tour and misbehave
Our bills are never late
On the stage rocking like I'm Jimmy Page
But fuck swag, I ain't dressing up like Kid 'n Play
Trying to snap on every track like Eminem on Renegade
If you ain't heard of me then you been living in a cave
Or sitting in a grave, or listening to Drake
This music business is fishy like penetrating a bitch who didn't bathe
Wanted on the streets like I went to prison and escaped
Fuck the police, these authority figures get disobeyed
It's like I'm pinned against a cage, fightin' in the MMA
Bitch
When I roll through in my old school Cut' Supreme
From the outside looking in it's different, looking through the glass
Me and Tech ain't Bernz and Wrek, me and Wolf ain't Snoop and Daz
Cause the truth is that this music crap is difficult to grasp
That's why you never see me go on interviews and bash
Other rappers, I'm not the dude booin' while you at bat
