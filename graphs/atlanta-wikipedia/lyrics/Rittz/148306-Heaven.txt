I wrote this song on mushrooms,
It's like an illusion
Have you ever been to outer space?
Tour bus living liquor bottles all over, no counter space
Suckin' helium out from the balloon
Vickâ€™s vapor rub sticks, we snort for fun
Knowing that the real shit was coming soon
(Erus Rof)
Started thinking back when I was scared to say bad words
Before for the internet making up Facebook passwords
I see Casper floating in my room
On some futuristic shit like a Jetsons
Looking at the world with my eye lids shut
We give it all to live but when we die then what
My high's electrifying like the lightning struck
I look up in the sky and hope that I end up
In heaven, heaven
Hey, pass me the squeegee (Somebody threw up)
You done brought 2 hoes backstage (The the the Sammy Hagar)
You told me 3 hoes was Dio cause they was (Headbanging)
Hey let me get another shot of Jack (FUCK YOU!)
What?! Oh you drank it all (FUCK YOU!)
Fuck it where's the Canadian mist
Now I'm on some plastic bottle drinking shit
Represent, represent-sent
Tribe called meth, represent, represent-sent
3 more shots of moonshine I do fine, I
