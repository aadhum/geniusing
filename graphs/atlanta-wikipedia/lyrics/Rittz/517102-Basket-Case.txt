Self, self-pity, self-self pity
Why the fuck is everybody else giddy?
I woke up and felt shitty
Matter fact I felt the same all week
like
And I think I might need help getting out of bed
Cause I'm here and I keep spinning out of thread
I'm my own worst critic and I gotta write a album
But I keep hating on myself, it's like I get obsessed
Cause I hate what I write
I be thinking too much wondering what they gonna like
I don't got a lot of fans, I'm afraid that I might
Let 'em down if what I make don't relate to them right
My manager clowning, "what you write another deep song?
What is it this time, your lady, your struggle trying to be some{thing}?"
Not in the mood to write a weed song
I take the beat and give myself a mental beat-down when I rap
I'm my own worst enemy the energy I have's a waste
Cause I use it battling myself cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
Staring at this glass of whiskey, wishin' I would pass away
But I'm always wishing for the worst cause I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
(Da, da, da, da) I'm a basket case
I can't have conversation with rappers
Not to quit and
Anyone can rhyme, thinkin' and drinkin' and sinkin'
Inside my Lincoln
This music industry is dumb, dumber than the comments on YouTube
Saying that I use the N-Word? (Hell Naw)
