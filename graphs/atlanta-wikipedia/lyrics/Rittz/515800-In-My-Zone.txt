I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
I've got Sade in my tape deck, I'm just movin' right along
Cause I've got sunshine in my pocket, I'm just right here in my zone
[Bridge: Mike Posner]
In my old school bumpin' that "Kiss of Life" beneath the city lights
Caught up in the moment, getting misty eyed
Bout to give my past life a long kiss goodnight
This dream difficult for me to visualize
And now it's real and they say the limit is the sky
But my feet set on solid ground, no more stalling now
On the road to get it cause, when it rained, it poured
But now the storms finally calming down
Up in my cutlass driving, the sun is shining
My Strange piece studded with a ton of diamonds
I ain't got a bunch of money on a constant grind
Still it beats being blunted with my stomach growlin'
In the darkest alley, got the heart to fight
I see the stars are bright, they screaming Jonny Valiant
Rappers wanna bite me, they crocodiling
I be up in Neiman Marcus smiling
Try to walk a mile inside my J's, playing make believe
You can say that you played in the major league
Wear my heart on my sleeve on the stage and leave
I feel wet from the sweat on my Famous tee
I'm never scared, fuck shaking like a maple leaf
Cause what awaits for me is unknown
So I lit up my J, filled my cid-up with straight
Crown Royal, now I'm in my zone
This ain't no ordinary love
I was sick of being poor and said "enough"
Right up 85 North and there I was
Working, breaking down doors and barriers
Still representing Georgia
I'm feeling the support
Spread the word cause the more, the merrier
Nobody blowing out the torch I carry
I ignore them every time they point and stare and judge
All because I got Jordans on, I got a gorgeous blonde
jewelry blinds,
Getting' paid doing music now, I'm putting' huge amounts
Inside a few accounts
I got a crew that's down
In case you wanna come and duke it out
If I was you, I'd throw the deuce and bounce
And we just blew an ounce
My hotel room looking like a hookah lounge
I'm blowing up like a bazooka round
I got booed and bowed but stayed positive
Even when I didn't have a pot to piss in
I was sitting on a bottle steady plotting this
And I'll be fine dining at The Optimist
Made a toast to the homies that are gone
Two for the fans and the love they shown,
My calendar at this caliber's for the life of a bachelor
I'm burning through cannabis canister after canister
Um, so many cameras, they flashing, I never glance at 'em
Lost inside of a landfill of thoughts while watching this dancer
I'm wondering to myself if she's got some booty enhancer
Either way, I feel the deep inclination of putting my hands on her
I'm a modern day Galileo who lives in Atlanta
The capital of the ratchets, aristocrats and traffickers
A practitioner, practice until I master it
Passionate 'bout my adjectives, syllables so elaborate
Anything less to describe me is just inaccurate
You're a student of classes in which I am a graduate
Immaculate vernacular
Batmobile
blues
I think you squarer than Madison
I'm-
I'm in my zone, ain't no way I'll ever snap out of it
