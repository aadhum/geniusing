Drinking while my pinky ring is blinging off the city lights
Old school Montecarlo
fuck a foreign whip
Speakers knock knocking in the trunk
And what I got is on my job some exotic I'm just happy I can finally afford this shit
My kicks still brand new cuz i move with ease
LRG Denim with the Diamond tee
Bumping Big K.R.I.T in my time machine
My chain hanging from my neck like a tire swing
I've been trying to strive for the finer things
I wanna fuck get high and drink until I hear the fat lady and the choir sing
I've been acquiring expensive tastes
Taking vacations to private beaches
On tour in Destin Florida
On a Georgia beach, drinking pomegranate margaritas
I'm in Chattanooga
drinking crown and coke
Then it's back to the ATL
Then we threw a couple dollars at the hoes on the pole got to go because I know I'll spend up all my bread
my centerfold dinner roll pussy wishin
Watching episodes of the Sopranos
Put on Stevie Wonder
No more hourly wages washing pots and pans
No more feeling embarrassed wearing this uniform trying to find a place to wash my hands
He said "dog, Wolf wants you at the radio station" just great I'm late
Funny how we was talking about quitting last year and giving up on the wildest dream
Casinoes
streets of Greensboro
gringo
Who ever bought my shit and showed love to me thanks again cause this must be paradise
