Somebody gimme high five
Jeremy got Adidas on my feet and got the biggest
Pinky ring you ever seen upon a white boy's hand
White boy going ham, ya'll wearing tight jeans
Going glam, going going going damn
Got em buzzin in the club like, boing boing blam
Like a fat couple fuckin in a dodge ram
Cup fulla Crown who drunk as I am? (I am!)
Coinstar
I know the magazine'll wanna gimme five mics
Feel like I'm the hottest MC times nine
Kick shit like a Kung Fu flick, hi-ya
Bout to go down on this bitch, sky dive
Yela put me on the elevator goin up
Any rapper steppin to me on the mic I'mma bury him
I ain't scared of bein arrogant, never gets
Hard, but these bars hard, like a barbarian
Now I'm in the limelight, I might, take a ho to see twilight
Have her on the bed sceamin OMG like
I'm Usher
I just wanna see
Kill a motherfucka like I'm Chris Benoit
Have em screamin "Oh Lord" like a Christian choir, man I'm finally on fire
I, got Crown up in my Styrofoam I'm
Poppin X pills and I'm rollin like a Firestone tire
Rittzo gone go skitzo when I'm sippin on the crystal
Swingin like I'm Klitschko
Fuck around and I'mma split yo wig
They was hopin I would never get noticed
I don't think I've ever seen my dick so big
thongs like Sisqo did
In my '64 smokin San Francisco shit
Kill a motherfucker then I dispose his
Dead body bury him beneath a bed of roses
Mel Gibson bitch
lid
Pimp shit like fish and grits
Gwinnett county where they found me in the valley of the crystal meth
Hello... good mornin
Still sippin coke with the Captain Morgan
Gotta a closet full of Pradas, Air Max and Jordans
