Fuck the rookie of the year bitch I'm a future hall of famer
You can see I came up
Long time coming from a dude who never gave up
You know another rapper comin' hard as me then name one
Talk alot of shit about me, I don't entertain em
Bang em, fuck hoes used to ball and chain em
The groupie at the show that blew me, you would probably claim her
Put the pimpin' on the bitch you suckers oughta tame her
Blame me cause I turned her out she used to be an angel
Stranger, but canned a strange music new addition
Fans told me to kill it I'mma do what you insisted
Famous tee and Levis we ain't got the True Religion
Coming out the super system on some slum shit
Eating mushrooms on a two day long trip
Crush it with the credit card
Or the room key used to get inside the travel lodge
Camouflage, Jeremy Scott's
Chevy Avalanche
Fuck a bitch and when I finish tell the bitch no mas
Adios!
About to blow damn right, steppin on a land mine
Representing in a A-Town skullcap
I ain't from the country bitch mother fuck a straw hat
We ain't ridin skateboards we be rocking all black
Thinking that it's all good, find out that it's all bad
Stick you up and run off with the shit y'all have
Please you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
Shit you ain't like us
We ain't like them
And if you listen close enough than you can be like I am
You can be like I am , you can be like I am
You can be
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
You can be like I am
See y'all be on some trash shit, I be tryin to smell good
I smell blood
I be like a predator
Still y'all judging me because of my appearance
You got alot of nerves everything I hear sucks
Even if I was to use a pair of ear plugs
Posing like they taking pictures for the year book
Rowdy like a white kid who got a beer buzz
Put us in the four bitch
You the type of dude to do the quit and give up on em like Deangelo
Cameltoe pussy boy, gangsta on the internet
This world small fuck a gun cause a punch in the mouth
Will put a stop on people trippin on this twitter shit
injury
No hope
They try to keep me out the gimmick that's a no-go
Pogo stick bitches still jump a dick
Cause my buzz getting bigger by the tickin' of the second hand
Make your wife try to hide her wedding band
Make your life pathetic man, Damnit that'll never stand
