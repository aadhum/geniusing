(Turn up, Rittz!)
Shut up, bitch!
Lifted on the beat, bout to murder it now
It's Rittz in this bitch, White Jesus back for the second coming
Second time around I keep it extra slummy
For the check, I’ve been a threat, I’m feeling extra hungry
Too much of a veteran to ever let them son me
Better check the record books, I rep my county
you’re flexing Gumbi
And I’m beginning to feel like I'm a black guy
Turn up, turn up
All they ever say is turn up
They know me all around the world, Australia to Europe
There’s levels to this shit, and I’m a different caliber of
MC, and you're the kind nobody's ever heard of
They need an article of me in the Atlanta Journal
Constitution, pay homage to me, they should paint a mural
Of me on 85, my shit is a brochure of
Gwinnett, respect the way I did it and didn’t switch up a minute
you couldn’t touch it if you wanted to, like you're a
Germa-phobic taking over shit
It’s bloody murder every time I burn up
[Verse 3]
Two years in a row I got skipped on the freshman cover
Got me feeling some type of way
And I ain’t hating on the rappers they picked, but I’ve been headlining tours
Selling records, no competition inside my lane
Up at the hip hop awards, killed the cypher
Paved the way for Gwinnett County, bitch you know I’m Slum
You can listen to my first album
And see where some of these double time rappers got their whole style from
I had White Jesus in my crockpot before Ross said walking on air
