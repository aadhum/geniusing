Fuck swag (4x), Swag
15's in the back of the Dodge
Out the garage
better recharge
I talk about the clientele and tell 'em they won't be off
I'm off
And be better this cars and the swap in the squad
They think they swagging but they lame as fuck we laugh at these boys
Uncontrollably like we just hit the gravity bong
Trying to dress up like a wierdo hoping that somebody notice 'em
Make me wanna strike and knock em down like they a bowling pin
Cause If you don't like me go and watch some Nickelodeon, you lil motherfucker
I'm over and I stick 'em up they say they're YOLO go and then provoking
And it's hard time for me to tell the difference between a rapper and a singer
Of a rock and roll band I don't think this shit is appropriate
Way too many rappers wanna look like Lenny Kravitz
Personally I think these pussies get too many passes
Thrift store shopping with the shit your rocking
Looks lame and your music ain't neat the shit is average
I don't sweat on people talking shit about the way I look every day
Long hair don't care, red pair of Air Jordans
And I wear all black, no hook
Fuck swag (x10)
All these rappers wanna bite like they don't know how to write
They constantly freestyle and think its tight
Every time they say a line with a metaphor in it
They wanna pause or laugh or ad-lib
Trying to sound like Gucci or Future or Tunechi
These dudes need a lesson before they get behind the mic
They was feeling me until they see I'm white
Now they like "man he raps too fast"
What you slow homie? You handicapped?
What you need a walker, a hearing aid, or a fanny pack
What you unhappy the champ is back
The Manny Pac of the rap game that can't relax
I'm bout to raise the bar and they can't adapt, the cameras flash
Cause they see a star when I walk in the room
North side, Atlanta rap, I bet you wanna walk in my shoes
It's funny that I'm hot
Last year I was just cool when you
You was too official
Where
Tied yo' dick in skinny jeans, take your Louis belt and whip you
would take a pic
Post the shit on Instagram now suck a dick
Still slum, I don't pleasant hear 'em
Bumping Big K.R.I.T. and Yelawolf I don't feel punk
Rappers with no skills come on witness me I kill them
You fucking with me I'm the real one
