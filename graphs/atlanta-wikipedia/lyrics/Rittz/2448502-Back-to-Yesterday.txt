[Hook]
One day everything that I ever loved was gone
It all got stripped away
So now I'm crying inside and I wish I could turn the time
Back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Let's go back to yesterday
Remember Valentine's Day 20-10
She was so upset 'cuz I had to go to work
We ain't got to spend much time together lately 'cuz the rap was finally taking off, I had to put it first
My boss said one of us can take off early
I was like "me please" 'cuz I wanted to surprise - her
So I drove to her job, turned my lights off in the parking lot 'cuz she was getting off at 5
My stomach giddied out when she came outside
She was walking with a guy, laughing and something didn't seem - right
And when she noticed me she looked like she was busted doing something
Tryna kiss me, I said "who the fuck is he?" - my gut
Feeling was killing me, I couldn't even eat
'Cuz I felt like she was hiding shit, I couldn't let it go
I asked her one more time "is there something going on between you and him?"
She looked at me and told me "I don't know!"
"You don't know?! What the fuck you mean? You've been cheating on me?"
She admitted her and him had kissed, crying
Telling me that all I do is spend my time writing, working nights, neglecting her, she don't love me like she did
Well the last 5 years were for nothing
Yeah we struggled but we loved each other now it's coming to a sudden end
Fighting, tryna move my furniture up out of momma's crib
Pack my shit, kiss our dog on the head then I left and I felt like...
Death
My mama said it's gonna pass playing 80's music back to back, Johnny Hates Jazz "Shattered Dreams"
I bet you
Scared to switch 'em thinking
But it's 2 a.m., I
sadness
Xanax
is
while I'm in this position
Never visioned that this bitch would do me like this
who reads slow
