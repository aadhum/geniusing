Shit my flow aggressive
I've been told that it's so impressive
Might have heard me on a smoking session
Sounding nasally, but mainly cause my nose is messed up
I've been out in California
snortin' blow with Ke$ha
There's no one fresher
But no one ever compliments me
So many dope white boys out now Iâ€™m chopped liver
But if you want Rittz, then this is what I give ya
The C-N-T
So I don't got no time to pay attention to gossipers
Slumerican the clique if they ain't wit' us, they not winners
A monster is bout to murder it, you're an eye witness
So run for cover, thought that I was bluffin', now die bitches
Your five fingers only thing the Troopers done found
The rest of your body, dump in the Chattahoochee to drown
They fucked around and shit got ugly try ta' punk me he gon' be a bloody
On any record, any second, it could be a
BLOODY MURRRRDAHHHH
Jonny Valiant in this bitch
(Tech N9ne!)
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Gimme the bomb my nigga we killas about to pillage
And abolish a bunch of you bringing battle into my village
I cannon em with calibers
look at your lady I smile at her
I let her get it bust her melon open like Gallagher
Massacre, you're gonna be pissing through a catheter
I be ripping with the lip and about to flip
They're gonna laugh, at your rap, I'm a scavenger
Tech is a cold-blooded killer leaving you lavender
Quincy Jones, he told me that I be B-boppin', we rocking
Better than ever you're gonna see watch a G-Shocking
Peeper,
how you gonna get with a creature
Murdering everywhere they be stamping my Visa
Even though people knowing I be killing for leisure
Shaking the fuck out of niggas and giving em seizures
Arriba, arriba, ain't nobody can see the
White Jesus murdering anyone, Tecca Nina!
Rap saw me and Tech (zombie attack) killin' em, chewin' em
Call me a hooligan I'm not a human I'm a mutant in the rap game
Better be makin' room for me I'm movin' in
Been hated on so much I grew to be immune of it
