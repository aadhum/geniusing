The-the-the-they say who the white boy that done signed with strange
No security, but I don't gotta hide my chain
A lot of rappers cryin' now they see that i done came up
Maybe some of these babies need a diaper change
I'm driving drunk
I'm bout to hydro-plane
Flyer than a jet-liner at a air show
Custom jeremy scott i bet you wish you had a pair ho
Try to hit a lick i'll leave you stiffer than a scarecrow
Weed I'm smokin' purple like a varicose vein
Strange piece hangin' from the franco chain
A select few newcomers get approved from us
We just make fun of no way jose
I'm surprised i gotta fan base
Can't fake with em try and I'll deprive you of a handshake
Can't wait til my album drop
Ima cop a monte carlo supersport tee top and a mansion with a man cave
growin' plants
Chain Tarzan swinging black beanie on
In 2013 I was warmin up on the Revival Tape
Sippin Grey Goose straight with the hint of lemon
I'm toxic on that white boy shit
Now turn your ass around we're going ass to mouth
We're doing massive amounts of coke
What you thought I was lying on the remix of Cashin Out
Simple minded would you rather talk about illuminati?
What you juice and do Pilates, you read and you meditate
Watch the history channel you really think
These rappers are part of some secret society
You probably think that David Blaine levitates
Probably think I'm hooked on meth I can't quit my habit
Ri ri ri rittz in this bitch and back at it
Bout' to kill another victim that shit is tragic
My dad's a maniac too I figure it's genetics
You step to me you gonna fuck around and get Be-headed
