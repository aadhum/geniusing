Another school shooting just occurred today
Thinking what on earth
Could make somebody run up in a school or a church
Little school kids stripped of their vertebrae's
The internet got us so shallow that we impersonate
Celebs' thinking that we all should be one
Hurt somebody's feelings
Shit all we do online is diss and talk bad, and we bash
Total strangers
disposed
My homie just got Hodgkin's Lymphoma
I'm praying every day hoping he gonna beat it
Strong motherfucker on the phone with me
Telling me jokes while he's going through his chemo treatment
And he didn't put one sob story on his timeline
Instagram or Facebook ain't always real life
People staring at their phones so much that they forget to look up and see the skyline
Like "I'm
My lyrics are merely mirrors to the tears in my eyes
Iâ€™ve done my best to share my life
My privacy's been sacrificed
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
I've put my soul in every word
I've shared my pain until it hurts
But now we've reached the end
Until we meet again
Ah yeah
Woke up and I checked Worldstar this morning
A cop just shot and killed a black kid
It was all recorded
Just like the incident they put up two days before it
It's become so normal that it sickens me
There's so many people with power that won't go forward
The problem ain't gonna solve itself
Then one of my fans tweeted that Mike Brown deserved it
I said, "Man, you dumb as fuck
Imagine you went to the store for blunts
And tried to run out the door with a pack
And the cops didn't bother arresting you
Or give you a lecture
But instead they just murdered you dead, man this shit ain't right!"
We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal
They are endowed by their creator
With certain unalienable rights
And among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men
Deriving their powers from the consent of the governed
All men are born free and equal
And have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights
Among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties
That of acquiring, possessing, and protecting their property
And find that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness
We've taken too many steps forward to take this many back
We've taken too many steps forward to take this many back
