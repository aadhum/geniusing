Pick up the fuckin' phone, pick up the goddamn phone
Ah fuck, oh goddammit
Baby if you get this call me back immediately this is a fuckin' emergency
I, I think I did too much shit my fuckin' heart feels like it's about to shut down
So call me back, quick as fuck please. Bye
Cocaine in my nostril hair
White lines chopped up on a cloudy mirror
Heart beat tellin’ me to slow it down
I ain't listenin’ and I can hear it loud n’ clear
Still tryna snort lookin’ for a drip
Trippin’ out knowin’ I did too much
Havin’ a panic attack I feel short of breath
I shut the bathroom door n’ wet my face hopin’ that the water might cool me off
Tryna throw up in the toilet to get it out my system my nose started pourin’ blood
And that made it worse, the blood stained my shirt, im contemplatin’ wakin’ my parents up
Tellin’ the truth I’m overdosin’ on coke but maybe it’ll go away I’m just paranoid
Got some Xanax to the dresser drawer
Here I go again mixin’ uppers and downers the sound of my heart like a tug o’ war
Closed my eyes an realized that I wasn’t sure
I calmed down and I snorted more like goddamn
(Hook)
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
But if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen
Let me see another day again
Holes in the gloves of the homeless man
Freezin’ as bad as the cold cement
On the corner beggin’ with an open hand
The weather man said it’s probably gunna snow again
There more holes in his clothes that expose his skin
Sick with pneumonia he’s old an slim
The wind is unbearable, he hasn’t ate in days
Diggin’ through the trash find a burger that’s halfway eaten some packets a mayonnaise
He just lays in waste below the underpass
The homeless shelter too full now there’s no one left to come rescue him
Life of her was so promising
Popular, a homecoming queen
Dreamed a becoming a doctor one day
They act as if they was attached at the hip
Every time you saw one they was coupled up
Neither one of them drunk that much
But one night they got the invite to go n‘ drink with friends
It was started out to be a normal night
But change the course her life and have a tragic end
And then 10 shots later said they had to leave
Her friend said stay you okay to drive?
One of the dudes tried to take her keys
She said please you’re trippin’ I’m okay I’m fine
She got behind the wheel her boyfriend was trashed
On the highway goin’ way to fast
Hit a sharp corner round a bend and crashed
She hangin’ on waitin’ for the Jaws of Life to get her out
