Live from the back room,
Every lyric that your hear feeling like a stab wound in your stomach
get your eyes blacked raccoon
My Cadillac VROOOM!,
85 north,
A-town, homie, we ain't riding skate boards
Rapping for the underground until I'm in the grave yard,
White got soul like i'm B.B.King,
You wanna battle ring the bell, homie, DING! DING! DING!,
"The Life And Times of Jonny Valiant"
Strange Music
Slumerican
Northside A-town
