Raised, in the home, of the brave,
was embraced, by the slum
Labeled as strange, but his name, will become
Top Of The Line, yeah
I suppose that your eyes were closed the whole time
I've been on the rise for almost five years
But most of my peers they hope I nose dived
Like an aircraft that crashed
They congrats you, dap you
When your back is turned they throw knives
I ain't handicapped or slow or no average Joe
I see past the smokin' strobelight
Put me up against your favourite rapper
You sayin' snap and harder than me, close but no dice
The difference be in my consistency and I don't need MC's to ghost write
Who you know that pitch that always throws strikes
Everytime I get the ball across the goal line
I done made it out the bottom on the slow climb
If you talking to my dogs they all gon' cosign
And I'm sitting on a gold mine (Gold Mine!)
Songs I write are from the heart it ain't meant for the closed mind (Closed Mind!)
Seal with the end of your rope and now I'm right here, closing by
Third time's a charm, I already let them know, twice
Let me set the record straight I'm the best, there ain't no one better, fuckin' let the rest debate
I accept the hate that'll desecrate I just set the pace
Set to detonate, some that disagree
Must be deaf cause they, underestimate
Me, but that's okay
Ain't nobody gonna come and take my crown
Mile
A-Town down
need CPR
Like Kanye's speech at the MTV Awards
I got a pair of new shoes you probably never seen before
Man I throw the peace sign,
As-salamu alaykum
All the music I hear just sounds the same
A bunch of wannabe Futures
You wanna be Eazy
You gotta be Ruthless
I got the pills and I'm fucking with a soft heart
Shit I can't recall the last 15 years wishing I could do an interview with Nardwuar
See my hair and the beanie and they get the wrong idea
Say I look homeless shit my shoes 200 my shades 250 a pair
