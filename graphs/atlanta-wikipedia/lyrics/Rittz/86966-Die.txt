What you mean you don't like my shit?
Well, it's obvious that you don't have no taste and your opinions suck
And I don't expect to be everybody cup of tea
But don't act like I ain't killing everything I touch
I crush every record I'm on
So holla if you wanna get a feature while the price is right
See I try to be friendly, the MC's offend me
And done what I done already it's barely begun
Wearin' my hair like it's hilarious tell me what's funny
Die
Haters step aside, they wanna fuck with me
I swear to God, I’ll kill 'em 'til they show respect, or not
And everybody’s gonna
Die
Dead, shedding blood
I got the grave digger diggin' ya plot
I got ya body rottin' deep in the ground
Cause everybody gonna
Die
I'm not used to this music shit
I guess that I'm cut from a different cloth
Photographers, bloggers, producer pricks
And musicians as a whole are starting to piss me off
Is it possible that everyone's an entrepreneur?
Talking to you like they a Hollywood star
And you should be lucky that they even let you get your foot in the door
All I hear a ear full of manure
I don't know them much more
I can't ignore it, they just trying too hard
To be cool, and cuttin edge and wiggle they fucking dreads
I feel like I'm surrounded by dorks and corn balls galore
Maybe I should have my boys tie 'em up with the phone cord
At gun point and tell em hit the floor
Cause everybody gon' die
It's Johnny Valiant: the head turner
I turned to a head hunter
My homie co-signed me so I came in and bull-dozed
My way in the industry
I'll prolly be a killer 'til I'm George Jefferson bald
My plan's to be famous and get a bad bitch
Maybe Casey Anthony'll marry me
