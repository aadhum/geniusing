[Verse 1: Rittz]
Yeah, my God, my God, I’m odd, I’m Strange
Tech want me to kill em, give me a time frame
And point em out I'll gun em down yelling "Die lame"
Let the wet blood spots fly, gonna drop pain
I’m game, they think I'm playin but I ain't
Why lames act hard, they far from it
Killing you ain't nothin but a walk in the park for me
Backstage doing blow with a snow bunny
Rappers that you thinks dope, we poke fun at
But don’t come at me wrong, homie you don’t want it
These coyote dudes too slow for this roadrunner
.357 throatfucking you, choke on it
with Tech
or Krizz
or Ces Cru
Or Lynch,
Kutty,
Big Scoob
or ¡Mayday!
You see the Snake and Bat upon a necklace, they know it’s (Strange)
We’re the Number 1 independent
Ya-uh-yeah!
This is what you waited for (x3)
Tech told me to kill em, say no more
This is what you waited for (x3)
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
Tech told me to kill em, say no more
Strange in this bitch and we waging war
You can say no more ain't no more to say, Kaliko
We're the Neros
underground getting the euros
(Okay) This is what you waited for
Baby boy, this ain’t the chorus
I’m just playing I ain’t got to say no more
I’m just playing I ain’t got to say no more
he’s a banana so peel him
Sucker, you never gonna get the weapon to fold the soldier
Animals in the road,
never slow the cobra
Callin me insane is a name with honor
Evil up in the brain make a Bane persona
Pickin the punk and push him to pay
Pop a pill 'pon his people and pray
Peep at you passive for penalty play
Pitches, pasta, pregnant pussy penne
Nigga Mardi Gras, hella gnarly y'all
Change the game derranged I came for gore
Came here to spray galore
I done said a whole lot and I say no more
