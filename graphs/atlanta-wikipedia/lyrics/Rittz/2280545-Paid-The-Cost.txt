wastin' time inside the jar
I ain't hard to find if I ain't touring I'm around the A
Like I should of been a member of the House of Pain
Long hair like a young Diamond Dallas Page
If you don't like me, then blame Strange Music
That's great, Johnny
So I'm battin' like Babe Ruth
But now, I got a clothing line and my own flave' of vape juice
