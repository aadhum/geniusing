Ye-Ye-Ye-Ye-Uh-Yeah
Slumerican Shit, yeah
It's Rittz,
Jonny Valiant
Bitch Bon Jour carry on board
I've been deadly on the mic since back in '04
Mother fuckers say I disrespect the art form
You don't wanna piss me off cause I'm a ticking time bomb
I'm from G.C., everybody hardcore
When they hear that gun clap like an encore
Leave the car door looking like a dart board
More holes in your body than a golf course
Fuck that I'mma stand tall, never fall short
Heard someone say I got the ball in my court
My boys,  and my gutter homies I'mma die for
I’m not a human I’m more like a cyborg
I soar on the highway 85 north
Mingling on Singleton on down to Five Forks
I'm sure you ain't heard of me
But now it's time for
People looking in the sky like why Lord
It's White Jesus
Don't trip cause this ain't blasphemy
Actually that's my nickname
Rittz in this bitch
And the beats from Plymp mane
And can't nobody fuck with the pen game
My punchline'll punish 'em
Man I'm coming like Big Pun in the 90's
Rapping like fuck 'em if they ain't feeling where I'm coming from
Cause everybody bubblegum
We ain't even listenin' to 'em, we making fun of 'em
And say it right in front of 'em
Ain't no comparison
Fucker we're Slumerican
And everything been looking lovely, the way the cake is crumbling
I've been observin' local rappers and it's troublin'
They bite so much, it's like someone needs to muzzle them
Some people's ego be so big they need some humblin'
They wishing I would disappear but here I come again
It's like I, finally got the ball run around fumblin'
Still crumblin' erb, drunken and slurd, mumblin' words
I must have emerged from nothing to something
All of a sudden everyone say they love me
And they call me
It's been a long dark road and no one acknowldege me
Feelin' my homie, kickin' me when I finally hit bottom
When I was fallin' they was laughin' at me, watching me topple
I was callin', everbody walking on me and stoppin' me
But they thought I was finished, they was sure I was done
Swung back as the rapper that I was gonna become
In the industry, noticing the majority's young
Cocky mother fuckers acting so important they just won
And my fam got me feelin' like I'm the normalist one
Cause everybody using words like "vibe", "sonic", and "viral
All I can say is fuck, got damn it's my go
My lyrics paint a picture like a Pablo Picasso
I know, that can't nobody fuck with the squad
Yelawolf, Shawty Fatt, Young Struggle and Watts
Don't let the long hair fool you
I don't play the guitar
I'm a rapstar
[Outro 2]
