Superstar, man I'm far from an average Joe, supernatural
Stepping out, looking like I'm in a fashion show
Came into this industry and now you're witnessing me blow up
Like seeing a tank of gas explode
And I'm, I'm high like I'm flyin sitting back of coach
By the window sipping Jack and Cokes
'Bout to pack a bowl but we ain't tryna bake a casserole
Looking at the globe from up high,
shots fired
Like Kennedy was riding by the Grassy Knoll
I ain't rich but I got a little cash to blow
When haters saying that I'm changing
I'll be looking at them laughing like they cracked a joke
They wasn't with me when I traveled down this gravel road
GC, I could never have my pass revoked
So step up and you a dead duck
Get your head bust, looking like a chef just cracked a yolk
Speakers in the Caddy rattling the patio
When the industry was only rocking platinum gold
I was dope back then, but you had the whole
Shit locked until I came and I cracked the code
But then again, my fans look at me as the G.O.A.T
hop in my 'Lac and float
A Ya Uh Yeah
Take a puff and it's up and away we go
Put some pimp shit on my radio and bounce, bounce, out
Tony footwork
Up in Kalamazoo,
We don't bounce 'til we spend a couple thousand on shoes
These music dudes were clueless who I was
'Til I blew, producing woohs and oohs and ahs
If  these pooches choose to bite, get euthanized
Bumping 8 Ball & MJG, from the outside looking in
I'm sitting on top of the world,
my speakers got that rattle back
And take em in and fuck em from the back side
But I ain't got no time to fuck around,
I'm feeling like a billion
I'm filling up my cup with that crown and bounce out
Smoking wood, then I’m gone
So far that you can’t even see me through the eyes of a telescope
jottin' down my feelins'
Acting like it was the realest shit I ever wrote
Mental telepathy is part of the recipe
That let me know that you want it
I'm giving it to you how you like it
Biology of a pimp, it be in the DNA
To know what you
On Forgiatos, don’t hit no potholes
Strange Music
Come and twist Rittz, tisk tisk, cause you gon get your shit split
Better be strong to live in the city I come from
And if you ain’t fucking with it then let it be known
And we can either talk about it or be about it
Me I’d rather sit back and blow an ounce
