Eat a xany bar and I chase it with captain Morgan
I hit the night life, so I can see what's on the market
I put some purple off inside my L
Hundred dollar bills will help me dry my tears
I ain't switched and went Hollywood homie I'm right here
(Reverse Talk)
We could be on top of the world like 8 ball and MJG, shit
Seemed way more simple in them days
My speakers beating like a drummer when they playing the djembe
Scarface, Outkast, Biggie and Eminem was my Sensei
I'm 32 the years in the struggle is unforgettable
Feelin' like I was unconscious finally comin' to
Looking at living now from a different altitude
T.O.P
