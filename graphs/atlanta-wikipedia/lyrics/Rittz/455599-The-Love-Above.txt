White and Gwinnett my neck of the woods
Slumerican cliental
My red afro hanging out my back, skull cap
Everybody looking at my shoes like “ooh”
You’d be lucky if you find a place to buy these on the web
Now I ride a Cadillac and let the candy paint drip
Way too fine to drive a BT Cruiser
People hear my music and it screams the future
Like Doc Brown and Marty McFly
looking down on em from above
Instead of driving slow I hit the gas pedal then I
trunk
Bust a left on Chesterridge road
My girl (?_Vox) Dj'ing, She playing speakerboxxx
Singing “I like the way you move”
I bought a Crown and Sprite, I look around the right hand
With some Crown 'Royale' in my future
People showing me love, I tell em' that feeling is mutual, Imma be back
