Yeah... They don't really want it with us. Yeah...
Shit my flow's aggressive
I've been told that it's so impressive
Might have heard me on a smoking session
Sounding nasally mainly cuz my nose was messed up
I been out in California snorting blow with Ke$ha
There's no one fresher
But no one ever compliments me
So many dope white boys out now
I'm chopped liver
But if you want Rittz then this is what I'll give you
So I don't got not time to pay attention to gossipers
Slumerican is the crew if they ain't with us they not winners
Monstrous platinum murdering you are now witness
Run for cover thought I was bluffing on dime bitches
Your five fingers only thing the Troopers done found
The rest of your body dumped in the Chattahoochee to drown
You fucked around and shit so don't be trying to punk me it's gon' be a bloody-
TECH N9NE!
Give me the bomb my nigga we're killers about to pillage
And abolish a bunch of you bringing battling to my village
Canning them with calibers- look at your lady; I smile at her
I let her get it;
bust her melon open like Gallagher
Massacre!
I be ripping with the lip and about to flip;
They're gonna laugh, at your rap, I'm a scavenger
Tech is a cold-blooded killer leaving you lavender
how you gonna get with a creature
Murdering everywhere? They be stamping my visa
Even though people knowing I be killing for leisure
Shaking the fuck out of niggas and giving em seizures
Arriba, arriba, ain't nobody can see the
White Jesus murdering anyone
