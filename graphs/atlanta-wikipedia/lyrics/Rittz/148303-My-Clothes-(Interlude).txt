Let me tell you something right now
Don't you ever try to call me back
You understand me?
I'm gonna say this right now for the record
I'm 100 percent on my mom's life
On my sister's life, on your life
I never ever ever caught a fucking girl
Never
I told you never ever ever ever ever try to touch my fucking clothes
I'm out here tryin to make a living for the both of us
You fucking ungrateful, you fucking asshole
I'm out here tryin to make a living for us
And all you give a fuck about is some bitches
And facebook, stay the fuck off of facebook
