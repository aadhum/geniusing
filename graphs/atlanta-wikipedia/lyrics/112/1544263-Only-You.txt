I need you in my life
Where do we go
What do I do
I can't live without your love
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel
Like I am the only one for you
Je-sus the notorious just
Please us with your lyrical thesis
We just chillin,milk em,top billin
Cats lay low like Pablo in milked out diablos
The more I smoke, the smaller the phillie gets
Room 112 where the players dwell
And stash more cash than Bert Padell, inhale
Inhale make you feel godd like Tony Toni Tone (feels good)
Dig up in your middle like Monie
