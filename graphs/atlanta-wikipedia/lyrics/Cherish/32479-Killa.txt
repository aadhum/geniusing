I'm in a wife beater, two seater, cruise control
Pull up and your girl might lose control
Not Playaz Circle but a Duffel Bag Boy
Guaranteed they can't get enough of that boy
Shorty is a killa but I really want him
My whips push button on car keys man
Pop the top like a sardine can
Wrist stay flooded like New Orleans man
Lebron can't stop how I be ballin man
Got big wood and some big Cahunas
I'm a pretty slick nigga like Rick-a-Ruler
Keep one eye open and my hand on that Ruger
my shades Cazal
I treat your chick like a pair of Ones
Wear a ass out one good time in the slam
