Fuck a mattress, being on the floor
I’mma need ya to do a little more yea oh
Shower is overrated
Gravity’s left the building
I’ll be on top, really I’ll be on the bottom
‘Cus we goin be having sex on the ceiling
Take me higher, take me higher boy
witch it up one time
Want you to drive me crazy
Baby we goin have sex on ceiling
And I have you standing up when I’m around boy
Nothing to make us burn the carpet
I need some furniture, let’s get it started
Victoria, give me the secret
And I’ve been saving it for you
I turn the TV up, up, up, up
Turn the bed upside down, flip me round
Gravity’s left the building
I’ll be on top, really I’ll be on the bottom
‘Cus we goin be having sex on the ceiling

Take me higher, take me higher boy
Switch it up one time
Want you to drive me crazy
Baby we goin have sex on ceiling
And I have you standing up when I’m around boy
I turn the TV up, up, up, up
I’m so proud of droppin it low
Til the jump don’t stop, let’s go
