Can’t get caught up throwing stones at a glass house
If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain’t nobody perfect
Ain’t nobody perfect
‘Cause you keeping pointing fingers
And I’ll keep pointing fingers
It’s like we’re throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters
If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain’t nobody perfect
Ain’t nobody perfect
‘Cause you keeping pointing fingers
And I’ll keep pointing fingers
It’s like we’re throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters
If you look in the mirror
And I look in the mirror
Ain’t nobody perfect
Ain’t nobody perfect
‘Cause you keeping pointing fingers
And I’ll keep pointing fingers
It’s like we’re throwing stones at a glass house
And it shatters
