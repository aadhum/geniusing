I love when you pulling up in your Jeep, bumping all your beats
J's on with your shades on, just to bring me something to eat
You the man up in these streets, but when it comes to my heart
That don't mean a thing no oh
[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Sevyn Streeter]
Baby hop in my ride, ooh it's hot as hell outside
Got the top down with your doors closed
With my hand up on your thigh
Drive slow ooh, take your time
[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
I love when we pulling up to that beach
Sand down in my feet
Sun down, nobody round, that's one hell of a scene
You rocking my body, rock rock the boat, Aaliyah
Don't it sound familiar?
[Pre-Chorus: Sevyn Streeter & Chris Brown]
Every little thing you do got me feeling some type of way
When you give me that thunder you make my summer rain
I love you to infinity
Infinity, infinity, infinity, infinity
