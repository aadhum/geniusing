Don’t play with'em don’t be dishonest
She not understanding this logic
I’m back and I’m better
I want you bad as ever
Ain’t nobody better
We ain’t happy with'em tell me what was said'em
Can’t turn a hoe to no wife
Boy say she spend up everything
She keep begging for a ring
Don’t bring nothing to the table
And this thang so juicy baby wet like rain
Got good p***y baby can I be framed
Keep it 100 boy that ain’t the only thing
That will keep a nigga around like he say up on a game
And you know that (oh baby)
