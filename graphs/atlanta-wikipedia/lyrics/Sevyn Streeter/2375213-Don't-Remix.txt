Don't play with'em don't be dishonest
She not understanding this logic
I'm back and I'm better
I want you bad as ever
Ain't nobody better
We should be together
Baby it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Ooh baby no pressure
If my nigga know that he messed up
He don't even know how to catch up
I am on a whole other level
Can't turn a hoe to no wife
call on the house say
