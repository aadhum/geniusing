eep it one-hunnid, I ain't worried 'bout what you drive
Talking 'bout what's important,
Heard you got about four bitches (Say it)
Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)
I just want you to (Prove it)
Heard you got about four bitches (Say it)
Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)
But this ain't right I give no fucks
Bout yo dough, I got my own, I got my own
Been on my line
Swerve in your lane
Cause the ladies wanna hear
Me talk wild on this shit
So I'm a make 'em proud on this shit
You think we only want
You for your money, and it's funny and that's why I came back top down
Heard you got about four bitches (Say it)
Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)
I just want you to (Prove it)
Heard you got about four bitches (Say it)
Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)
Heard you got about four bitches (Say it)
Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)

Tried to say you had less boy don't (Do it)
If you say I'm on your mind (Show it)
