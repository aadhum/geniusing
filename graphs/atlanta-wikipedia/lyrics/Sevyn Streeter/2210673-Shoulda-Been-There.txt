They say you never know what you got 'til it's gone
You shoulda been there, now she's singing this song
Before this go wrong, we should take a break
Cause you feel like you know, you know everything
Before I go and say some things I'm gonna regret to you
I'mma call up my ladies, and tell them how you drove me crazy
If you didn't want them all on me, you shoulda been there
So why the hell you calling me, you shoulda been there, been there
My whip clean, my fit new
I put the "D" in Decatur
I bring her to life with that D call that a defibrillator
Ha, niggas is funny, they all got jokes, Cedric The Entertainer
But we can't see the haters, there's way too much cheese on the table
They say you never really know what you got 'til it's gone
You shoulda been there now she's singing this song
You wasn't there, I took your place
