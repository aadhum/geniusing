[Chorus]
Now you all alone, ain't this about a bitch
When I stop chasing you and now you wanna chase me
When I stop loving you and now you wanna love me
When I stop caring 'bout me, now you wanna care
Laid up, new boo, this right here don't concern you
Smiling like I'm supposed to
I always knew you would, I always knew you would
Always knew this day would come
Bet you ain't know this day would come
