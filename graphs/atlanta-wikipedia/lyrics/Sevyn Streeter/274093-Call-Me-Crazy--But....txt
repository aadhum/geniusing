She could be the baddest ever
But you belong to me yeah, me yeah, me yeah
And I ain’t with that sharing shit
I don’t wanna know
How she makes you feel
Keep all that away from me, far
Away from me, far, from me..
Whatever whatever whatever it is
It doesn’t matter to me baby, I’m yours
You’re still my baby, to the core
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy I’m yours
I ain’t going nowhere, you’re my life support
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy
Call me crazy crazy crazy crazy
Lock me up in your arms forever
And never set me free, no, free, throw away the key
Damn right I be on that obsessive shit
