I should've I never offered it
But he made me feel like this could be forever
Never thought he gon run off with it
But that don’t make it no better
He used to hit me least 4 times a day
Til he got what he wanted
Caught me by surprise
I never saw it coming
Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…
I should’ve used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I’m a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn’t gave my heart away but I trusted you with it
Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' em do this
Bitch ass niggas
One minute call us baby
Next minute call us crazy
Niggas be on that bullshit
Bitch ass niggas
And you’ll say it’s all in my head
It’s all in my head
It’s all in my head
So ignore my intuition and
Believe every word that you said
Walls fell down and up
There goes my pride
Guards shattered
Now I realized…
I should’ve used protection
Instead of moving so fast
But I’m a sucker for affection
Shoulda never showed you that
And now I got myself to blame why did I let you come in
I shouldn’t gave my heart away but I trusted you with it
Niggas be on that bullshit
Having us looking foolish
Can't keep lettin' em do this
Bitch ass niggas
it’s
And I feel
Like you just a waste of time forever
