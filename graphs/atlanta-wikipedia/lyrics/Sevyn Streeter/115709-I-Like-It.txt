Oh I think I might need a cigarette
Don't know why we do this
Why we do this for (for)
One day we be in the Cadillac
I be riding with my seat laid back
Next day I be breaking all your windows
Keying up your doors
Don't know how
But baby
(Ooh you)
You do it so good
I break all your stuff
That's just how we love
We keep it so hood
How you make me feel
Can't nobody do that for me
And we go through some things
But I can't stop loving you
And oh
The way my body feel
When your laying right beside me
I know I be catching attitudes
Throwing things and getting mad at you
Yea it's crazy
But it's in the name of
In the name of love (love)
And everytime we say we through with it
We back in love again
