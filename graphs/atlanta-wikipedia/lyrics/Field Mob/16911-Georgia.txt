("Georgia!")
Country names, country slang,
plenty dro
YEAH! Dirty words, dirty birds, it's MEAN in the Dirty South
If you ever disrespect it, then we'll CLEAN out ya dirty mouth
Bulldogs clockin
these lookout boys is hawkin'
You gotta be brave in the state of ("Georgia")
I got five Georgia homes, where I rest my Georgia bones
Come anywhere on my land
I'll aim at ya Georgia Dome
ATL Thrashers
Georgia Tech
I'm from the home of neckbones, black eyed peas, turnip, and collard greens
GA, the Peach State,
Candy yams and chitllins',
this Peach cobbler called ("Georgia"
Look on ya map, we right above Florida, Nex to 'Bama
Under that Carolina to Tennesse, you'll see ("Georgia")
With ass so plump, lips so thick, With 'Llac trucks sittin' on 26s
Now I was born in the 'Bany on the bottom of the map
call us some bammers
And now they
Jock the grammar;
But ya hustlers on ever corner like the Waffle House in Atlanta
R.I.P Camoflaudge out in Savannah ("Georgia")
Now you might come from vacation, leave on probation
Home of the strip club
Known for the thick girls, With the chicks put tips in the tip cup
Hundred thick chicks wit' the thongs and the big butts, Wanna get the
Freaknik
When you see them confederate flags,
Yo folks picked cotton here, that's we call if the field
We on the grind in ("Georgia!")
All the time....
