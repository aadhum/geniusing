it's a celebration bitches
24s on the donk go (round and round
Round and round round and round)
24s
On the donk go (round and round
Round and round round and round)
My donk got big feet I'm drivin on the third flo'
My paint +change faster+ than the +cast of Road Rules+
My tires is skinny the rims wide and swole
My sound system like ya +life+ I got the +highs and lows+
Ya hear me comin I'll give you time to hide ya hoes
+Xzibit+ to "Pimp My Ride"
My Chevy Caprice's windows darker than my complexion is
Tinted like you ridin in the car with the President
And it's sittin way up in the air
Cause my Chevy wheels +bigger than the ferris at the fair+
I +wax on and wax off+ like I'm +Daniel-san+
I thought I saw my ceiling on the back of a milk carton
