wanna put ya lips below ya navel
Up against the lips above my chin
To kiss ya low as if ya gential's below a mistletoe
let me treat you like a postage stamp
And lick ya before I stick ya
it from the back I have her walkin like she cripple
Im the king of the quickie, I be workin it
beat it so good you'll wake up wit a sore rear in the mornin
Callin me talkin bout Smoke you knocked my period on
And how it hurts to sit down and work
Eat um up, beat um up, then switch sides
You earthquakin and shiver like its cold
pregnant glad it ain't mine
Its a fact I was strapped, I ain't lyin
Doctor say its a lil girl good
Now I get pussy and head at the same time
