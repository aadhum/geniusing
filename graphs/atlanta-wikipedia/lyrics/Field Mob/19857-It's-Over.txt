Ashy to to classy's a classic
The roota to the tooda
Is it cause we country
We easily under-appreciated
But when we rap, we snap and conquer wit lethal statements
And some of these heathens hatin
Or dumb for believin they can
Ever defeat us or make a come-up recievin bacon
I leave 'em shakin like the hands on muhammed ali
