I came up in the hood infested with teenage hustlers
Matter-of-factually, I'll stand alone with no entourage to back me
GOD is my every existence; exhalation, exactly
My tongue is my gun, revolutions already begun
I like LL, but GOD da G.O.A.T'
HE da greatest of all time, if I'm lying I'm blind
Can I get a Amen (Amen brother)
Coming to Church with a devil tucked in your purse
Sister Samantha from Atlanta, can't even much finish her prayer, Worried about what Sister Martha wear
good die
Your phone tapped, under surveillance, secretly indicted
Being watched daily, livin shady just to drive a Merdede
