Rent thirty days late, gotta be gone by Saturday
Tired of sellin' cocaine
folks tryna' trap me
Every night dreamin bout livin life lavish
A watch full of karats, a candy coated Caddy
Off the show flo', sittin on fo' Vouges
Oak wood gear shift
???
Choppin on seventeen inch Enki's
Bling bling from my mouth to my pinky
Enough about my jewelry, grill, and my Fleetwood
Tryna still live
stable so my folks can eat good
House sittin out on the hill to sleep good
Livin peaceful, just like we should
Money legal, no more sellin reefer
No more FEDs tryna' stick me like a needle
When it's cold outdo' come in I heat ya
He ain't gotta walk in the sun, I A.C. ya
Bump worryin 'bout that burgular comin to creep ya
Get trapped by alarms and the millimeter
I'm a do or die playa for my people, follow the leader
I'm my brotha's keeper, for real
I'm a have me a big nice Caddy
House on the hill for my ma' and my pappy
Live life happy and I'm still nappy
Makin legal money, no FEDs tryna' trap me
What ya know 'bout havin no dough, no coat for the winter
Remember, we poor folk
Most cut yolk and smoke
coke
Talk about they wanna 'Lac with four do's, no Vogues
Wood kit and Momo's
pockets so swol', Jenny Craig
I rap with God, cause I feel you ain't really safe with gats
We escape slacks, the government help and welfare
My folk cries to the Lord, ain't no help there
We ain't have much, or less to brag about, but mo' to lose
I ran the street, mama told me go to school
But now I got a chance to change things and maintain
Mo' so, I ain't gotta slang 'caine anymore
Now put your hands up if you're broke, folks tried
To spoil ya
With fried bologna sandwiches and sugar water
Don't disguise the dirt did cause we all know rocks
It's the real reason furniture go to the pawn shop
Cause ya crackhead cuz smokin the car antennas
(B) Understand see...
(K) It's a junkie in every family
Them my hand-me-down, tight pants, lookin slim in 'em
If they too big...
(K) What you do?
(B) Put a hem in 'em
'Member talkin over the loud sounds when the wind blow
Cause the trash bag's replacin yo' car window
