Yeah I dropped a tape
Surprised myself man
I don't know how I feel about it
Other than fucking amazing
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Let me give you lil' bio by the southside nigga
I like my bitches on their back with their mouth wide nigga
Explosion

I can't afford to get caught in a bullshit that life brings
So I hit the the club and I turn up
Fresh as fuck your ho might know me
I don't have a bunch of dimes but I keep some strong sixes like Turner
Know some shot niggas that'll burn ya
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm from the A-town for the most part
Kicking shit up your party
Ain't bothering nobody
She a choke artist like Webber
It wasn't hard for her to notice me
My James Hardened like OKC
As she hit them high notes like Jodeci

It's gonna take you somewhere you never been
