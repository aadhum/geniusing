Yo, cominâ€™ to you live from the A
I be a nigga that always stay real
Being a real nigga got me a deal
They say he go crazy, they say he too real
But being a real nigga got me a deal
No more Versace get off of my clothes
Thugnificent in the flesh and in the soul
I King Midas
Tell all these chill ass niggas
