Her skin the color
Of your choice
Trying to get her stock up
Rubber bands tie her locks up
The music open hearts that lock up
Please don't leave me alone
Cause I don't know where I'd go
Please don't leave me alone
Leave me alone
Please don't leave me alone
Cause I don't know where I'd go
Trying to find herself in vanity
Knowing drugs the only sanity
