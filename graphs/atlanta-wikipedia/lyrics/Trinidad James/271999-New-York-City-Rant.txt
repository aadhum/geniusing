New York make some noise man. How we feeling out there man?
I'm sorry I gotta come out here and do all this talking to ya, but... it's just how I feel.
I'd rather you fuck with me for who I really am than the nigga that you think I am, dawg. That's some bullshit. I'd rather just have ten niggas that get behind me.
I feel like my album is better than all this bullshit that these niggas is feeding you.
Straight up, man, that shit is just for a check and a chain, bro.
You can't tell me anybody out here who's a real fucking hip-hop fan, can tell me that Kendrick Lamar 'posed to be platinum just this year.
He been that fucking good! He been that good! He been that fucking good, dawg! He been that good!
But now, the nigga that we been knew, now he come and say shit like he the king of New York.
I gotta wear my bandanna on tilt like Juelz
and we just did our own thing.
But now we run y'all, musically!
That's crazy! That's crazy! That's crazy, my nigga! That's crazy!
I'm not trying to start nothing, if you wanna do something, we can do something, I don't give a fuck.
And now every nigga that's really popping out of New York, you might as well tell he's from Atlanta!
Y'all got niggas interviewing more popular than niggas, man.
Y'all got better interviewers man, shout out to Elliot Wilson, man.
What you wanna do next, man?
