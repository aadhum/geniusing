(Yeah, I'm talking true A-town trap shit, ya understand that?)
So conceited, I don't think my shit stank
400,000 dollars on a Mulsanne
Come and kick it with a west side nigga
Think I ain't about that action, wanna bet my nigga?
All day thumbing through the check my nigga
Okay, I got a kilo of gold 36 O's
Wrapped around the neck
Gold yacht, that's the presi' diamond in those
A true trap nigga, I done sold everything
Trouble man
hustle gang
Bought a gold bottle now we on the Dom
Porsche 911 with the Gabby top
All gold scale, that's my magic box
Got the soft, my nigga
Give me thirty minutes, I'll be right with ya
Got the hard, my nigga
Let me whip this here I'll get it right to ya
The streets dry as hell, this work high as fuck
She want white, boy, dudes take it easy man
Shit I'd pay less for a pair of Yeezy's man
She popped a Molly I'm guessing
.223 with a silencer
Gonna rock that shit with the flyest fur
All gold like Montana (Tony)
Hoes all in my phantom (Rollies)

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Ibn all on my head,
snakeskin all in my hat
Hit your girl with my chains on so that's gold all on her back
Gold all on my watch, so big it's like a clock
Some people wear fox fur, on the Source cover I wore a fox
Several bitches in every state
I'm in Miami with Wayne trying to skate
I owe her one, we did a 68
them ain't red bottoms
I'm smoking strong, my nigga, I'm on loud, not Bobby Brown
Fuck with me and I'm busting, fuck with me and I'm busting
Just got a girl chauffeur and we on a motorcycle and she driving
This Versace, that Versace, this Versace, too
See I'm on lean, on loud, and I got my own lane
