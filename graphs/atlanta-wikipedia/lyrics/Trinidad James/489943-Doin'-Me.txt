LeBron back home, throw the bouquet
That's the last thing I cheered for in, like, two days
Sometimes, I wish, wish I never knew fame
Got a deal and lost it, I'm back to doin' me!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me now
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm back to doin' me now
I said it's a chance that rapping won't work
And that my first hit could be my last verse
The people that was cheering for me, they won't cheer no mo'
And the niggas that said they love me, they don't care no mo'
I'm barely on, tryna get my niggas straight
Since so much I'm learning, nigga, learning to eliminate
So much burnt bridges, broken trust, tryna renovate
I can't trust these niggas, man, these haters take my energy
I'mma need to pray, yeah, I'mma need to pray like
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know where I'm goin' now
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know which road to go down
Lord, please forgive me cause I don't know how I'm feeling now
Don't know what to do, and all I can do is be me
I did it everybody else way, I'm back to doin' me!
I'm back to doin' me now
I'm back to doin' me
I'm back to me doin' now
I'm back to doin' me
I'm back to doin' me (x2)
I'm back on that givin' no fucks shit
All I give a fuck about, my nigga, is my momma
I'm back to doin' me now
I'm back to doin' me
I'm back to me doin' now
I'm back to doin' me
I'm back to doin' me (x4)
