T-Jame$, you already know
And I can't talk to everybody face to face
So I gotta do songs so hopefully you listen
Cause it doesn't matter what I say
How you take it is the only thing that matters
My nigga
Hoes, clothes and that money
Hoes, clothes and that money, I said
Hoes, clothes and that money
Hoes, clothes and that money
You get money, you get hoes
You get money, you get clothes
You get money, you get hoes
All the money in the world ain't nothin'
You can't please these bitches for nothin'
All these bitches wanna think they somethin' (they not)
Prayin' up to god for a chance (chance)
A chance (chance) a chance (chance)
So live, love your life now
What's your addiction?
You sit back and think about it
Is it more than one?
Well, mines's is the
Hoes, clothes and that money
Hoes, clothes and that money, I said
Hoes, clothes and that money
Hoes, clothes and that money
Uh, I got a ho addiction (okay)
And Her addiction (yeah)
Is a coke-sniffin, pill-splittin' young missis
[Verse 3: CyHi the Prynce]
All she say is "Can you buy me those?"
"Take me out I like Pappadeaux"
She love the mall she like to shop for clothes
She a gold digger and I'm a pot of gold
But the bitch can't even make sloppy joes
I dont ever spend the night, I'm like "Adios!"
All the real niggas sayin "Chuuch!"
The only thing missing is the choir robes
Pimpin' is like being a firefighter
'cuz you always got the fire hoes
But she prefer rappers, that's her favourite choice
