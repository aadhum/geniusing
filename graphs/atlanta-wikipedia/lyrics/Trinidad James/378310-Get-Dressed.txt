Life ain't shit like the rap game, I say, life ain't shit like the rap game (x2)
Life ain't shit like the rap game, so, my nigga, why you rapping? (x2)
Sometimes I wish, I never started rappin'
It changed how my friends, started actin'
And I ain't never change, since I started rappin'
The crazy shit is, since I started rappin'
Is that the same niggas hatin' is the same niggas clappin'
Maybe, if I pray for a chain, the shit'll quicker happen
Or maybe I'll just pray for a Range, so I can crash it
And, when a nigga bein' real, them niggas ain't here
I gotta talk about a whip? 26s on a Chevy?
I gotta talk about a bitch? Now you niggas wanna listen?
