[Hook x6]
I know you thought this track was over cause the have a hook so long
I'm in the club with my kicks up kicking shit,
Fuck what you rolling, it ain't that strong, it ain't that potent
Fuck you and the horse you rode in (Broke!)
I'm Nick James, if you don't know
Fuck that Kodak
Hit that blunt, and then I pass it
Hit your bitch and then I pass 'em
