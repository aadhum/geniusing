Mr. Officer, Mr. Officer
Please, let me go
I don't want to go to jail
And I can't afford my bail
Mr. Officer, please let me go (2X)
When you got pulled over for speeding
And you wish, you wish you were dreaming
You wish the cop was cool but the cop was a jerk
Everybody got 1 window that won't work
(Whoop-whoop) - I'm pulled over
(Whoop-whoop) - I'm pulled over
Cop at my shoulder
