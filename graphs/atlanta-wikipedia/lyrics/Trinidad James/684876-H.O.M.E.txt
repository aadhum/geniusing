Hey you, man in the mirror
Livin' for love and the music, shoes, clothes, and the women
You know the usual
The industry a joke, I guess that's why I feel so bamboozled
(?)
(?)
I'mma old school Atlanta nigga, golds and the Forces
(What the fuck you think?)
That I'mma just stop because the shit you're sayin'?
(Shit you're sayin')
Oh that I'mma just stop because these niggas hatin'?
(I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake
I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake)
I'd rather die a real nigga than to live a fake
I can't let these fuck niggas get the best of me
How I deal with the hate, how I stay at peace that's what they wondering, is what they asking
Smile in the face, with a bird in your pocket, that's the recipe
(?)
