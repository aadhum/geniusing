White girl shaking

Hell yeah I play with my nose
Got powder stains on designer clothes

Bitch I'm ballin, blow my whistle
Smokin' on a Bobby Johnson
Got felatio at my concert
Knockin on them hoes tonsils (2x)
Got my cock all up in her noggin
Got road head up in that caddy
And I can't explain nothin'
But I know one thing it was fatal
I be higher than a motherfucker

Looking for a trippy bitch
That cute shit I ain't with that
Ratchet bitches getting turnt up
Off a couple pills and a six pack
They roughed me up too much
That made me tough
Anyways man, where my homegirls?

I have homegirls
All my homegirls bob your head with me one time
Yeah
