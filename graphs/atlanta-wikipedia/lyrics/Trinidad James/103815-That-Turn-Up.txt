They say boy, who you do it for? bitch it ain't you
They say boy who you signed to? bitch it ain't you
They say boy who style'd you? bitch it ain't you
They say boy who are you? bitch I ain't you
TJ my stage name, dollar sign at the end that
Your bitch she came in, your relationship that's the end of that
You married nigga, you can have her back
I told you that on my first song, fuck nigga the intro
Always had to hussle her ring tone
[Hook X2]
They say James who got that check? No snitching!
