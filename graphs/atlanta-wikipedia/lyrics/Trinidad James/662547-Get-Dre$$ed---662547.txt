[Intro: Trinidad Jame$]
Life ain't shit Like the rap game
I wish the bombings in Boston, never happened
And I pray for a change, but I never see the action
Maybe if I pray for a chain, the shit'll quicker happen
I just wanna burn into flames, and live through the ashes
Uh? I just wanna burn into flames, and live through the ashes
