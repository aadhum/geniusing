Ladies, you honestly really think I give a damn if you call me ugly?
Let me tell you what ain't ugly: money
And most of these girls out here, they gonna fuck with some money, what they think they gonna get
I know I sound crazy
You are not finna talk to me crazy
Naan one of y'all, bitch or nigga
Trust me because I really don't give naan fucks, nigga!
So I'm crazy? Yes, I am! (x2)
Give a fuck? No, I don't! (x2)
Rosenberg tried me, almost hit him in the shit
Ain't no god for Charlamagne if he try me again
Ain't no love for fuck niggas that's acting like my friend
Just because I dap you, nigga, that don't mean we friends
Never hold your tongue, my nigga, get it off your chest
Cause, if you hold your tongue, my nigga, you gon' get depressed
And, when the shit get real, yes it will, who you standing with?
And, if you keep them "yes" men around you, they gon' damage you
I just speak the truth, yes, my nigga, can you handle it?
I'm a prophet in the booth, missing tooth, yes, I'm spitting shit
Giving you the clues and the news, check my channel, bitch
I was laying in the bed one time with a female
We just got done doing what we do
I looked at her right in the face and said "I own you"
Straight up, she said "you crazy"
I said "oh, you ain't know?" (x2)
She said she never met a nigga like me
Another Jame$? That's unlikely
