Now my side bitch my main bitch
Cause my main ho ain't feeling me no mo,
James, I said...
Fuck love it's overrated
Was disfellowshiped, now I'm reinstated
Might need a witness, these bitches crazy
Let me say it again (these bitches crazy)
Fucked her once, now I'm Swayze
Fucked her twice (now I'm Swayze)
Put my partner on, he got her pregnant
Man fuck life, life ignorant
Might need a cigarette, that newport
Got new shoes, got new clothes
Need new hoes (need new hoes)
Like old school, with two doors
I'm Too Short (I'm Too Short)
Too clean for them photos
So please do not snap those
Got my hands up with my eyes closed
Your girl head down with her mouth open
I'm in my tank top with my pants open
We got bad bitches and a ton of brew
Nigga we the truth, they loving the crew
[Dubstep]
Boy, don't you know, take it slow
Work it hard, take it far
[Bridge: Reija Lee]
Talk, do the sweet talk
