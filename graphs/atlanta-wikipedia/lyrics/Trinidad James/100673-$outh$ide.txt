You from the East side, then throw it up
You from the East side, then throw it up
You from the West side, then throw it up
You from the West side, then throw it up
This is south side and we showin' up
This is south side and we showin' up
Ratchet bitches, we love 'em
Classy bitches, we fuck 'em
Southside nigga, 'til the death of me
Fuck nigga, it's nothin'
[Verse 1 : Forte Bowie]
I'm from the Southside of the city
Niggas ain't fuckin' with me
We keep it 100, y'all niggas do 50
These bitches ain't nothin'
All these hoes is tricky
I'm saving all my love
That's rest in peace to Ms. Whitney
My team put you on silent, nigga
Them thirsty hoes don't get no dick
Them thirsty hoes don't get no dick
winning, can't you see ?
Nigga I walk it like I wanna walk it
Talk it like a bitch
Niggas be smilin' up in my face
Y'all niggas done fucked up ! Fucked up !
I’m from 417, Valley hill
We got Phillips 66, fuck a Texaco
Check my instagram
Got emoji faces with the hearts in 'em (freak!)
This my year -- I’m going hard, nigga
I prefer to call the butt naked (no socks)
I like my bitches butt naked (no drawls)
Got weed and molly and swag for sale
Miss lady, I’m just sayin'
What the pussy going for? Cause I don’t mind paying
Catch me at AMC 24
Me and her in them Concords
When a Southside nigga in a bucket hat
With them diamond slacks (them diamond slacks)
My belt be A-S (Jame$), my outfit be Offset (Jame$!)
And kicks calls for a double take cause these joints ain't out yet
She telling me she had to do me
Passed on the pussy, got mad and let my nigga Forte do her
