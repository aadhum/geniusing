This shit sound like 007 on N64 and shit
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, James
Don't believe me, just watch
This ain't for no fuck-nigga
This one for the hood niggas
Hipster bitches that shop at Lenox
Dark skinned, light skinned
Asian and white women
Hypebeasts we know aboutchea'
Don't buy shoes unless they popular
For the hoes, my nigga
That's pussy poppin' at Magic City
Smokin' mid, my nigga
Then don't pass that shit to me
(Cash Out)
Gotta love, Chesire Bridge
Them bad hoes at Onyx
I don't fuck with no snitches
So don't tell me who tellin'
This one for them colleges
Them bad hoes at Spelman
Shout out to them freshmen
On Instagram straight flexin'
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Popped a molly, I'm sweatin', woo
Mama always told me: "Boy, count your blessings."
In God I trust, so I kept counting them Franklins
OG Jordans, them high socks
No shirt on, I'm stuntin' (Okay!)
And this song for them fuck-niggas
Who hating on you this summer (Fuck 'em!)
Talk shit behind your back
But won't say shit in public (Fuck 'em!)
Don't believe me, just watch
