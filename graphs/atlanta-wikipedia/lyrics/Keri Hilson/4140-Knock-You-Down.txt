Keep rocking and keep knocking
Whether you Louboutin-ed up or Reebok-in
I never thought I'd be in love like this
When I look at you my mind goes on a trip
Then you came in and knocked me on my face
Feels like in I'm a race but I already won first place
I used to be commander-in-chief of my pimp ship flying high
Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky
Miss Independent
the load never too much, she helping me pull it
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be baby we just happened
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average
Woe is me baby this is tragic
Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him
