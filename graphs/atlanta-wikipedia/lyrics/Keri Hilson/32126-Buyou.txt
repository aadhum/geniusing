One for the paper, two for the money
(My girls get money)
I bet you never, ever get another dime from me
Was lookin for a man to hold me down
But how'd I end up with you?
Yeah, baby you
And as hard as I try, sometimes it gets hard
Payin all these bills, the note on my car
So I don't need no broke, broke boy tryin to holla (holla)
Face like Aaliyah and plus a college degree a
These niggas all the same, either they Ken or Ryu
Stringin you along allow me to untie you
Vitamin D supply you, let them little boys walk by you
They frontin cause they broke but the numbers don't lie
If they swear they so fly, tell me why they never fly you?
