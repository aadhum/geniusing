Shit I really sold 'em packs
Lost it all then I made it right back
Everything I say on these beats
Is exactly what I'm doin in the streets
Real street niggas gonna feel my shit
Started from the grind I built my shit
Four Five already I tote that shit
Got purp' on deck I Don't smoke that shit
Nigga get to yappin then a nigga get laid
We out here Trappin so we tryna get paid
I Ain't never been played better watch what you say
Have a 100 niggas sitting outside where you stay
Starvin' out here so I gotta keep a chrome
If nigga get bread then a nigga get Dome
You in a war zone boy this shit here serious
Better mind your business ain't cool to be curious
European steerin' Keep a nigga bitch starin'
Money keep comin' so the Diamonds keep glarin'
