Another mother gotta make another visit
Niggas dying its the same in Atlanta
Trying to fit in he call his self cool
Another little girl getting knocked up
Know the daddy, but he don't give a fuck
slanging the rock
You see his daddy was a dealer so he just like pops
And just like pops he say "Fuck the cops"
And a nigga like me ain't what I want for my seed
Cause eventually
The ballin' stops
And ya legs give out from due to running from cops
Feds rush the spot and freeze your account
Then your baby gets raised in another broken house
I done lost too many friends to the streets and the jail
Hope the sky got a heaven cause we living in hell
