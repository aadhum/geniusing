Fuck one hundred
Nigga I'm a million
Fuck that a billion
I put that one my children
Put that on my children
My unborn children
V12 engines gone in a instant
forty Glock bless you when this muthafucking sneeze
Achcu that's you
I just don't wanna go back to selling five dollar rocks
Moving in and outta town with a package got me noid'
Because I rather take a chance
Before I ever be employed by a cracker who don't view me as a man but as a boy
Cash every time while ya bank account voids
Never foldin unda pressure
Every time I leave the house grab the pistol off the dresser
still goonin'
Everybody lookin at me like grow up
Get it straight I ain't a crook just ain't living by the book
Let you keep your pride ain't nobody got to know
But you and I both know you went out like a ho
Chi-town nigga say joe I say Cuz
Is you friend or is you foe nigga speak your love
Im greeting niggas with slugs
Im greeting bitches wit hugs
Swimming in her pussy like a muthafuckin' pirate
Higher than the pilot
I can't lift my eyelids
Lotta fishs in tha water and im feeling like a shark feast up
