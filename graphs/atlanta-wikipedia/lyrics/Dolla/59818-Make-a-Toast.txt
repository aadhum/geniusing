[Dolla]
Let's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
Let's make a toast (Woaaah oh) (Let's make a toast)
Yeeeeah, Let's make a toast
Let's make a toast
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
I just whisper in her ear [Do it slow]
We gettin' paper like a billy goat
Remember being really broke?
You should see my safe, boy, that thing look like a jewelry store
Money grow like Chia Pets, I just gotta get it wet
Stretch it out like spandex
We don't rent apartments
We gon' buy the complex bein' broke is nonsense
I don't get the concept but understand the context
Money on my conscience money on my mind
100,000 on the watch
Who said you can't buy time?
Let's make a toast cuz we gettin' it, and we already got it
If you can't see me now, wait 'til I stand on ma wallet
If money is a topic, you consider me in
I get that guaranteed money 'fore the season begin
We can fly in any weather
[I forgot, what's the reason again?]
Hey make a toast to the Benjamins
Women I be swimming' in
Carolyn and Marylyn, Virginia and Savannah
It feel good to be American
Chillin' in your house
Waitin' on you like a brutha man
When it come to the money I don't under, I overstand
Middle finger in the air, bottle in my other hand
et's make a toast
We ain't never going back to being broke
Every day stay stacking up the dough
How she poppin' when she drop it down low
