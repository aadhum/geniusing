My home boy got life, gettin hard for me to look at em
Feelin like it's my fault, judge throw tha book at em
His momma call me son, his sista call me brotha
We was eighteen gettin it, chevys all colours
Hey I can be ya role model
Life ain't all about the club poppin bottles
For what you need, gotta learn how to follow
And Iraq we need to fix our own problems
