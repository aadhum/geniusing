California kushin
I Love it like good pussy
Pound for Pound
Word for Word
I'm ahead this third, grade
Rappin ass niggas i get better each verse
The money keep goin never sleep keep goin
Push it tot he limit cuz we gettin it till the mornin
Gun play is optional but money is the focus
No just smokin weed its me and all them locals
Chasin after a mil stay focus on my dough
I'm unfaithful to her why he try to pursue her
Connoisseur of the money &  honey and thick asses
California weed give a nigga Alzheimers
Nope i never sold a milli but im still head liner
Shoot ya in the head white chalk'll outline
Mathafucka some rapper I'm full time grinder
Part time rhymer rap recreation
Simple  ABC Another Bad Creation
Another nigga hatin introduce him to the pavement
Gangstas move in silence plus
We never make statments
Paper with faces of dead crackers pursuin
Tattoo tears reminiscing bout my pops
