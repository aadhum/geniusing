Move, mu... shoot with that
And if you can't feel it I'mma touch ya
Nothin' makes a situation better than chedda
Shredder
So I guess I'm famous like a Ninja Turtle
But I ain't got nothin', nothin' but money
Cuz if I don't do, if I don't do
Say go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy
+Tha Block is Hot+
the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' into the bank, honey I am home
And no disrespect to the lil' ladies
But fuck nine months, I hustle all year baby
Call me Mr. President or call me Mr. Every Pair
Or Mr. Everywhere or Mr. Never Care
Or Mr. Never Scared, no you could never scare
If a nigga owe me, believe he gon pay me
I signed wit Def Jam but I don't know Jay-Z
And I like my Sprite Pepto pink
I like good brain, but I'm lookin for a tutor
Got a money overload, my duffle bag won't close (uh oh)
From my jewels to my shoes, I take pictures of myself (Cheese)
