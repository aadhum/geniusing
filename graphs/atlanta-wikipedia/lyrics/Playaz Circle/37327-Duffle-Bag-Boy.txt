[Intro: Lil Wayne & (Tity Boi)]
(Yeah!) Weed and syrup 'til I die
As a matter of fact, it's gon' kill me, BITCH!
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy - get money
[Verse 1: Tity Boi]
Walk into the Gucci store, honey I'm home
I am on my shit I need a Pamper on
Toilet paper on the side for example homie
I know you niggas ain't heard no shit like this
I'm in a foreign car, smoking out with the doors ajar
We leave the dealership, head to the rim shop
You niggas barely dressing, I got thousands piling
That's that salad dressing, I'm on my Thousand Island
don't try me
And if I don't do nuthin I'mma fuckin ball
And I ain't bout to start runnin, naw, nigga, naw
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on a wall
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy - get money
[Verse 2: Dolla Boy]
Need a ho break a ho never nuthin new to us
Flows like a river the current is so rapid
big money talk
Let that lil' money walk
Southside I got what you want come holla at me
If I don't do nothing I'mma ball
I'm countin all day like a clock on a wall
Said go and get your money little duffle bag boy
Now go and get your money little duffle bag boy
And baby I ain't ever ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
Look honey - I say, I ain't never ran from a nigga
And I damn sho ain't bout to pick today to start runnin
