I'm a Trap Starr my pants saggin
So fresh I'm a need some Magnums
South side believe it homes
Tity-2 chainz
I paint all my cars black you would think I was racist
my white T smells just like a P
When I say P I mean a pound when I say T I mean a town
So take these P's to the T Let's go in the key let's lock it down
