ATL finest, south side behind this
I ride around with money like an armored truck
And yeah I need cheese like nacho
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich
Yeah we getting rich
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Yeah we getting rich bitch
My whole crew eating
Can't be fucking with you niggas while I'm dealing with these bricks
That's the same shit that broke Michael Vick
Disturbing tha Peace
Too much money, I don't know how to act with it
So I ride around up in my 93 Ac with it
Like women still licking my dick when I was Chris Lova
I wear black everyday like I shop with Darth Vader
Furry mink coat straight looking like Chewbacca
And we have gathered here today for the mulah
Rich niggas, Dolla Boy, Tity Boi, Luda!
