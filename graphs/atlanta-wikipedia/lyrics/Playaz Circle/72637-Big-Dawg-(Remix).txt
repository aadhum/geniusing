I'm in a Maserati and it cost one-forty
I'm a ghetto boy, I came up on Brad Jordan
I'm soaring in something foreign
I am so fly, it look like I get dressed in a Hartsfield
Orange and black Chevy, damn I'm ridin' Garfield
Yeah I push weight, my bag feel like a barbell
Got this constipated flow, you know this shit's on lock
And shawty even when it's cold, they be like Tity Boi hot
Ya dig?
We can do a deal, something sweet like Sadie
If not, I'm getting money, it go "Fuck you! Pay me!"
Diamond around my neck, chest all iced up
Duffle boys, in every whip a nigga play
