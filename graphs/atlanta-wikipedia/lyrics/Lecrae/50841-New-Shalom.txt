Wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom
I wake up before I throw a beater on, I thank the Lord for peace, or you can say shalom
I’m on and I’m gone out the door I’m gon’ rep my home. New Jerusalem, yeah you know where we belong
Got the Word in my heart. When the day start and the darkness wanna get us sparked up
So I keep a guard up, cause the sin in me wanna get the best of me and have me all scarred up
And I know I’m marked up by the Spirit still in me, fillin me up with everything I need
Yeah I got that cheese, but I don’t need a piece, I just need peace, please
I got the test results I’m very positive
That’s why I’m on this track with PRo because I’m posed to give some potent portions of potion proportionate to poster kids
Of pain and suffering whose daddy never loved on them, and wouldn’t know the peace of God if it was placed in from of them
And I was one of them, I don’t take my life for granted
So I'mma use this day tryna share my faith and pray that seeds are planted
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom
My vision on the throne, clearer than Petrone, yessir I am gone, in my zone, thinking ’bout the way my Father put me on
It’s nothing but grace how He’s still gives me faith and He died for the ultimate villain
Insurance like Geico, ’cause if I do not have His love I’m Norman Bates – psycho
I go hard, I still Rebel with Lecrae
don’t Trip just let Him Invade
I Sho Baraka Obama this peace is more than just worth it
so call Tedashii tell him Identity Crisis averted
I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, before I throw a beater on
Fall to my knees, thank the Lord for the new Shalom
I-I wake up, I-I wake up, I-I thank-thank-thank the Lord for Sha-Sha-Shalom
See
So chase that money, get your wrist cold as refrigerators
I will be an outcast ’til He raise me up – elevators
Me and you, yo momma, yo cousin,
