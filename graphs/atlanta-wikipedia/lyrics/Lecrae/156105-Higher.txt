Lead me higher
Lead me higher
And lift my eyes up
To the light where
I can see all the pain coming to an end
Lead me higher into Your fire
Burn away all other desires
And let my heart beat again
I feel myself rising high above my yesterdays
Yes, it pays just to pray standing in your rays
Sun shining, reminding me that you rose, reminding me that I'm Yours
And wrapped in righteousness robes
Closer that I get to you, the higher that I feel
It's like my spirit's been lifted outside the stratosphere
When death is powerless and pain will never lay acclaim
Earth groans to see you return to take us home
the sky below me
Like I'm sitting in a plane
Can't explain how I get to experience these things
Been to plenty cities, spent pretty pennies and ate plentiful
Do a show, I come home and feel empty? No
It's never me
I'm glad to say
I've been changed like presidential campaigns
Use to wake up in the morning pursuing the wrong things
Now I wake up in the morning pursuing the Lord's name
Take me higher than the highest, You're my hope and desire, lifting me up high
Despite of this gravity, lead me higher
