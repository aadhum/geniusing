I know a lot of guys out there are tryna steal your heart
But a real man hold onto it tight, 'til death do you part
Momma done raised me right tryna’ make me a knight, light
Shinin' armor, don’t harm her, arm her with all your honor
And don’t mind me that’s just wordplay
I ain’t playin' with it, that’s heresy
I never knew a love like this
Gotta be something for me to write this
Pray to God that when you hear you like this
We can make war, make babies
Yeah, you know like Meth and Mary
No side chicks and no secondary
No shoppin' ‘round it’s just commissary
I’m locked down 'til the cemetery, my whole life
My old life, don’t worry 'bout it
It’s been buried
And you’ve got my heart and my soul in your hands
You change my future with a glance
A wife and a kid, a house and a whip
Now listen
Any boy can go find a girl and try to satisfy her for a whole night
But a real man can take one woman and satisfy her for a whole life
Flex talk, sex talk
It seems that’s all they talk about
But real love is them sacrifices that you make for me when I’m out of town
They don’t know why you hold me down
How you hold me down
Been here, been real,
been trill
Some stay in love and some fight together
Some breakin' up and some runnin' out
