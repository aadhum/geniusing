Man I consider my life nothing
If I could just finish the race
And complete the job the
Lord Jesus gave me
I live to tell the world his message
Romans 1:16 "I'm not Ashamed"
I Ain't Ashamed
We Souled Out (souled out)
Seeking God's face till we fold out (fold out)
You want it, we got it
We ain't trying to hold out (hold out)
Break me, shake me, mold me
I'd rather die like Christ than live unholy
1 - 1 - 6 a band of misfits
Who get sick at the
State of the world
So we hit strips and spit
Christ Jesus, who scooped us out of the dirt
And cleaned us
We were slave to sinful ways but Christ freed us
They say we believe in a fools faith
Cause kids can grasp it
And salvation is granted, to those who ask it
But even if you don't know systematic theology
Or eschatology
You know Jesus is who you wanna to seek
We ought to be
Sowing seeds and teaching truth
Disciplin' groups of young soldiers
And reaping fruit
Aww yeah
This a part of our lifestyle
Might sound good on wax
But we livin' it right now
I wish you would catch me on tapes and CD's
But never see me in the streets in 3-D
B, Please
We ain't come here to appease
We came to spit these spiritual soliloquies
Why killers squese triggers
And hammers clap
I'm a shove on my bullet truth vest
And hammer back like that
Man I do this for the Way, the Truth
The Life, Jesus Christ
Until my soul take flight
The world's the same
Everyone want to cop a chain, cop a dame
Cop 22's on the range
Want to cop big fortune and fame
How many thugs you know hard enough to
Stop the flames
It's like
Standing on the tracks tyrin to
Block a train
You got the game
Messed up, Stop and change
Mind trapped all wrapped up in locks and chains
The same God you pray to before you sleep at night
The same God you direspect when you creep at night
Seek the light
Ain't no tring to plead for life
Talking about I sorry God
He like "Leave my sight"
The key to life
Is none other than Jesus Christ
If you a slave to your ways
Be free tonight
I spit these bars
Not to get no chicks in cars
Not for spinners on the wheels of expensive cars
Man I do this for the folk who like to lift their arms
Pray to God who gave us life
So he can give us all
Man I do this for the blocks in the hood
The Rock's in the hood
Jesus Christ, Cornestone
Getting props in the hood
Folks think we crazed and delerious
Cliqued up 40 deep
All saved, all serious (yeah)
And if you curious
We got some proof man
We got some answers
We got some truth man
Telling folks you know that God is
Watching you man
Romans 10:9
