I know a lot of people out there scared they gon' die
Couple of 'em thinking they'll be livin' in the sky
But while I'm here livin' man I gotta ask why
What am here fo I gotta figure out
Waste my life, no I gotta make it count
If Christ is real then what am I gon' do about
Everything in Luke 12:15 down to 21: You really oughta go and check it out
Paul said if Christ ain't resurrect then we wasted our lives
Well that implies that our life's built around Jesus being alive
Everyday I'm living tryin' show the world why
Christ is more than everything you'll ever try
Better than pretty women and sinning and living to get a minute of any women and men that you admire
Ain't no lie
We created for Him
Outta the dust he made us for Him
Elects us and he saves us for Him
Jesus comes and raises for Him
Magnify the Father why bother with something lesser
He made us so we could bless Him and to the world we confess him
Resurrects him
So I know I got life
Matter fact better man I know I got Christ
If you don't' see His ways in my days and nights
You can hit my brakes, you can stop my lights
Man I lost my rights, I lost my life
Forget the money cars and toss that ice
The cost is Christ
And they could never offer me anything on the planet that'll cost that price
Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my, Don't wanna waste my, Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Don't wanna waste my, Don't wanna waste my, Don't wanna waste my life-life-life
Armed and dangerous
So the devil jus can't handle us
Christian youth them a stand wid us
Livin' n driven, given a vision, fullfillin' the commission he handed us
London to Los Angeles
Da rap evangelist
Ma daddy wouldn't abandon us
"I gotta back pack fulla tracts plus I keep a Johnny Mac"
So are you ready to jam with us so lets go
Gimme the word an lets go
Persecution lets go
Tribulation lets go
Across the nation lets go
Procrastination bes go
Hung on the cross in the cold
Died for da young and the old
Can't say you never know
Heaven knows
How many souls are going to hell or to heaven so we gotta go in and get 'em
Suffer, yeah, do it for Christ
If you trying to figure what to do with your life
If you making a lot money hope you doing it right
Because the money is God's you better steward it right
Stay focused, if you ain't got no ride
Your life ain't wrapped up in what you drive
The clothes you wear, the job you work, the color your skin, naw you Christian first
People living life for a job
Make a lil money start living for a car
Get em a wife, a house, kids and a dog
When they retire they living high on the hog
But guess what they didn't ever really live at all
To live is Christ yeah that's Paul I recall
To die is gain so for Christ we give it all
He's the treasure you'll never find in the mall
You see, your money, your singleness, marriage, talents, and time
They were loaned to you to show the world that Christ is divine
That's why it's Christ in my rhymes
That's why it's Christ all the time
See my whole world is built around him, He's the life in my lines
I refuse to waste my life
He's too true ta chase that ice
Here's my gifts and time cause I'm constantly trying to be used to praise the Christ
If he's truly raised to life
Then this news should change your life
And by his grace you can put your faith in place that rules your days and nights
