They tellin' us make “America Great Again”
I'm like hol' up, when was America great again?
Was it when they took us from our native land?
Or maybe it was when they took the natives’ land?
Now, I know you’re like is this rap or is this gospel
Look, all you need to know is that I was blind
Now I’m not though
Real recognize real
If they don’t love me like 'Pac
They gon' respect how I'm moving
And then I'm never gonna stop
And led for two terms
