Oh yeah! (Oh yeah)
Here we go! (Here we go)
A little rough! (A little rough)
No sweat! (No sweat)
I can do it! (I can do it)
You can do it! (You can do it)
Ooorah! (Ooorah)

And yea though I walk through the valley of the dead
I was Tailored to snatch the mic' Swiftly like Ye' did
Hey put me 6 feet in the ground and watch a great escape
I promise, ain't a 6 shooter that can keep me down
My God's so official, that's a technical foul
Was engineered in my mother's womb for Gods' glory
Plenty faith in the persecution is inventory
I been spit in the face, still exhibiting grace
Kicked out many a place, just for sharing my faith
My belt tight, shoes laced, plus a breastplate
My war helmet on now I got my head straight
The battle's on but the war is over when Jesus reigns
And fo' His name I withstand the pressure and take the pain
And if they drop us, this promise, we'll take it to the grave
That tonight we may die, but to die is our gain!
But it won't be us, covered in His blood, spillin' our guts
But even if it was, let our dust blow in the wind, we win when it's done
I just run solar in the power of The Son
My God's a m-m-monsta
Treads on Black mambas defeats and conquers
ready to die, notorious
We die daily and wake up and do it all again
Either we certain or we certainly insane
Bullets riddlin' our frame, still we don't deny the Name
Maybe we lost it, we vuelvo loco
Cause Heaven is my home homie I ain't local
God, by all means possible
Give me the faith to live and die for the gospel
