clicked up 40 deep in the street you can find us
Ya we on theology but we be on the grind ya
When we was a youngers only had 2 place to run to
One become an animal, two get out the jungle
So we got our lion on the line bro
Run up on you and your crew and tell ya’ll Jesus is the truth
Open air evangelists
relationships, we do it all
Backpack still full of tracks with a Johnny Mac
hats to the back and our backs to the wall
Plus I got some homies out there who gon’ rep the rock
If you wanna make them stop, you gon’ have to bring a choppa
If they get martyred, then we gon’ go harder
Share the gospel on death row and let ‘em know that they been pardoned
1-1-6 to the day we die, ain’t tryin to be no superstars
You ain’t hear the truth today, I promise we’ll be back tomorrow
Backpacks they strap ‘em Johnny Mac and tracts to play for me this morning to label the streets, all day (okay)
1-1-6 for your boy, man this more than just some artistry
Cliqued up in community, baby, this here the heart of me
Real talk, real talk, before it was the real talk
I was in community just trying to have a real walk
Looking for direction but at times that I would feel lost
What's accountability? Your boy was prone to be alone
Folk making war within the stars; Han Solo
God used somebody to wake me minus the NoDoz
We do the plumb line I can see myself like a photo
He made us for community, another way's a no-go
Find us hiding behind him all prepared to fight, very tight
We’re living by the blood like we’re parasites, get it right
My team carries bunch of high beam blaring lights
Might seem scary but we nice, see we carry life
Ever since we heard about the murder how they buried Christ
Eyes upon the cross even though that is a scary sight
But that was the merger we converted now we very tight
He died for His bride homie, How you like the married life?
Christ the name we calling on
Can't wait until He calls us home
You know we be falling often we can't walk it all alone
Started with the cross and we continue with the cross alone
