Carlos was born in killa cali
And caught a bullet in his head that left him bleeding badly
He lost everything at that moment except his life
He lost his hearing lost his movement and he lost his sight
He laid there in a coma but man nobody cared
The Gospel preached in his neighborhood? Nobody dared
But los got up out the coma got and was able to hear
A missionary shared the gospel to his open ears
He got saved got trained got discipled
Back to hood you could find em preaching the bible
He led a homie to Christ from his same hood
Part of Church plant
This is blessing but Im stressing that this is not the norm
We need leaders and belivers to help carry it on
But who would minister in a sinister part of town
I pray if Jesus is calling you that you would be found
A rival gang caught him slippin tried to take his life
Praise God he had a place to learn the bible from
But then he gets saved and wanna preach Christ
They make him change his whole culture and way of life
He gotta get him a bachelors wear a suit and tie
Go to seminary by then all of his boys will die
Jesus came to invade culture outta nazereth
And used a couple fisherman who people saw as hazardous
The feet are beautiful if only they'd go
If ain't nobody in hood preaching how will they know?
Eric is better used taught trues in his context
Somebody please plant a church in his projects
In Luke 4:16 on down to 21
Jesus says he's messiah says hes the chosen one
Had a heart for the poor had a heart for the low
And 1st John 2:6 is way we should go
In Deuteronomy even tho they under the law
The tithes every third year the poor got em all
I ain't sayin you wrong if you live in burbs
I'm sayin turn your attention to the hood cause we hurting
Man if you ain't burdened please pick up your word
Tho this world is going down while we here we can serve him
We bring this to the streets because we knew the streets
I pray that more would be burdened to have beautiful feet
You never knew the streets but truth is what you preach
I pray to God you'd be burdened to those beautiful feet
Go, go, go
You hold the truth that saves so run and shout it to the world
They can't believe in something they ain't never heard
Go, go, go and run with those beautiful feet
