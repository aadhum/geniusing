fly coups
They throw some D's on but they still ain't got the truth
They blow they cheese on it then they die and what's the use
fruit
I don't need no fast money NOPE dont need a fast car
Yeah the faith is a race but i't ain't a nascar
Cause you keep chasin money like them hundreds got feet
50
That he still feel hungry even tho he got bread
Love of money's like crack both of em will leave you dead
When you die and face God ain't nothing left to be said
Instead of Chasing the truth you take a lie to the head
And homie all I can do tell you what Jesus said
Repent and turn from your sin cause the kingdom of God's at hand
People they want cheese american mozzerella
The enemies rat trap might snap any second
I'm like that dude in matthew who after finding a treasure
Gave all he had to get it thats a real go getta
They got expensive tastes but the faith tastes better
I know the ice wet but the living water wetter
read the 13 letters
But homie I promise you'll never profit chasing profit
Now look at 1 Timothy 6 it's so clear
You chase the money and wind up in a snare
Now a vow of poverty no it's not there
But you pursue God the rest he takes care
He ain't take that Cross to fund your vanity purchase
Money dough cash paper
If it was a woman I promise I used to date her
Now that we broke up she be callin ya boy a hater
Cause all I do is use her for Golorifying my maker
My treasures in heaven Christ is my satisfaction
If I was broke I'd be richer than folkv never had em
bentley
Was empty and he gave us life and that's plenty
sensie
An it's sickening, that knowing God ain't enough
We gotta tell em they can get rich quickly
Now this is heresy false it's not true
