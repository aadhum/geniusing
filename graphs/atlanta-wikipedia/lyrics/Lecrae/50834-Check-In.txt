Yo, check me in
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-check me in now
Check me in
I know I’m sick and my addiction got me itchin’
Everyday I need a fixin’
I ain’t quittin’ till it kill me
I like the feel but hate the taste of the product
Like the numb on the tongue when you taste narcotics
The bass gets to bumpin’
Death is comin’, I’m tryna warn ‘em
That’s why I was summoned
I say I’m gon’ quit but I’m at it in the morn’
It goes on and on and on and now I’m used to it
This a lifestyle now and I don’t know what else to do
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab, rehab, reha-ha-hab, ready for rehab
Rehab
