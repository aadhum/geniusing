I know I'm not fit or deserving to do this
But I'm foolish
If I don't spit to give you Godly influence
As I give my feeble attempt at glorifying Yeshua
Cause He
Is the beginning everything came into being
By His being the being who created all other beings
There is none like Him
And now despite sin
I give praise the God who made sunny days
To white lightening
To sing "Whose world is this" without proper enlightenment
He use intelligent design
And since our complexity is more than irreducible
He's the owner
Holding the throne
Potent and strong
But since he up-rose he told us to go on this road
The ground did the Harlem shake
The light of Christ is a blazing one
I'm evidence that His Grace is amazing son
