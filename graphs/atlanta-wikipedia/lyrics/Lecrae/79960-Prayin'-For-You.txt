Father God
I'm praying to you
For somebody who knows You Lord
But, just hasn't, hasn't been seeing You in the right view lately
Hear me out...
Father, I'm praying for a friend
He and I are really close
And out of all my friends for this one I'm concerned the most
He say he readin' daily, but he ain't really learnin'
He been in church but say that he ain't moved by any sermon
His faith weak
He ain't prayed in a week
He wake up and just weep with his face in the sink
Lord, you gotta help my man
I'm prayin' for him daily
He ain't sinned but it just seem as if he goin' crazy
He say he's feelin' trapped
Can't even hit up the mall
Cause every lady's half-dressed temptin' him to lust and fall
He keep the TV off
Videos just make him feel like he ain't really nothin'
Without money, girls and shiny wheels
The other day he told me that he feels less a man
Cause he ain't have a 5-year plan, or a piece of land
And man its crazy cause his family thinks so much of him
Plus he got a godly wife who's always showin' love for him
But he's strugglin', even though he talks to me
I tell him what to do but he don't listen when he ought'a be
I'm scared for him cause there's people that look up to him
He got some younger siblings who've been changed by what he's done for them
But is it done for him?
Lord don't let it be
If he don't wanna talk to you then Father hear from me
Yeah, I'm prayin' for you
Yeah yeah, I'm prayin' for you
God, his condition has worsened
Since we were last conversin'
I'm with him now, and he ain't doin' well
Of this I'm certain
He say he tryna' trust You
Doesn't wanna disgust You
But he was in the midst of sinners and did not discuss You
And just today his anxiety's got the best of him
He knows Christ but for hours refused to rest in Him
He's not the best of men but Lord I know he really loves You
And I can't understand why lately he's not thinkin' of You
People trust this dude
You could crush this dude
Father he needs more of You
I pray You touch this dude
What can I say to him
I'm determined to pray for him
Father empty and break him
I pray You'll just have Your way with him
Cause there's a change in him
And the effects are strong
I pray You open up his heart before the next song
And when he gets home
I pray he'll open up the sixty-six book love letter You wrote and soak it up
Cause he ain't hearing You
And he ain't feelin' me
And God I know it's killin' You
Because it's killing me
And matter of fact there's something else he's concealin', see
The person that I've been prayin' about is really me
