Never been no one to waste time
Beat that beat up like a drummer on a bass line
Lil' momma tryna hit me with the waistline
She don't see I got my lady on FaceTime
I'm unashamed, can't stop that
You feelin' like a hater, stop that
They told me, "Hold up 'fore you drop that"
I'ma do it, pull the top back
'06, top down
Four fours, block now
Right hand don't even know what the left hand doin'
How I'm gon' be worried 'bout what the next man doin'?

They call me E-40 but not the Sigma brush
Got my name from drinkin' 40's
Yeah you a Jedi charge it up for a hover ride
Now I'm getting microphone profit
Look like I got sandbags in my pocket
Baby on my boots but it's too late
She hungry to her I look like a plate
Let me be straight up
You need to get your weight up
When my money was low I stayed high
With my chin in the sky, do or die
Got a lot of haters, couple critics, and a stalker
Me and God be talkin', He told me not to bother
I got a master plan from the Master
So let 'em talk about me while I'm lookin' crazy dancin'
My clothes don't match and my holes got a pants
Wait, I think I may have may have said it backwards
It's cool though, how you do that there?
Actin' like nobody know what you do back there
I hear that hate a mile away, I notice you back there
I ain't dwellin' on it, I ain't tryna do that there
