Been up all night, Got me feeling weak
No sleep on the first day of a long week
I guess I'm still in school,These people testing me
But disrespecting me I will respond aggressively
A long day short fuse in the worst mood
My temper red hot I will get these boys blues
Hard livin got me feelin very selfish
Crab in a bucket tryin' crush these other shellfish
Forget the chip upon my shoulder man I carry boulders
I don't know how to control them when they get to rollin'
I hit the dough, push my fitted to the side
Heart full of pride, anger in my eyes
Been this way since the day I seen my homie die
Cus I read Galatians 5 and I didn't see the fruit
I don't know what else to do, I don't know what else to say
So I hit my knees and pray, God take this thing away
I'm angry, and I don't really care what they say
I'm angry, nobody better get in my way
I'm angry, I'm fighting, I'm bustin, I'm poppin
I'm caught up in a rage, man somebody better stop me
I'm angry, I'm hating, I'm pushing, I'm shoving
Somebody better get me cos I'm 'bout to do something
I'm angry
And Jesus paid my debt while
I reject him willingly
Not to mention torture, Jesus took all my misfortune
Unforgiveness is my pedigree
1 Peter 2:23 man, when they used to hurl insults at Jesus, He didn't retaliate
He entrusted Himself to the One that judges justly. The gospel manages our anger, ya feel me? The solution is to gain a heart that's thankful for grace in Jesus Christ!
