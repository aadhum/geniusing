Yeah, I got a question, after the show, after the set, after the music stops, what's next?
Are we just writing songs or are we concerned with uniting a people to follow the great commission of Christ
Yeah let's get it, let's go...
Back in the day I was a lunch line rapper, after that I guess I was a punch line rapper,
then I got saved
and sometime after, ya boy came back as a frontline rapper, and when I say the frontlines, that's not a frontline, I’m out here preachin’ Christ on the frontlines
and no it ain't about rockin' stages ‘coz some of my engagements are out on the pavements yeah
I'm out to take the Bible, create disciples, who make disciples, disciple-cycles,
that's why I want the beats to knock so after the music stops you can meet the rock I pray
that you would know him well, this is like show and tell, it's more than a show, I'm showing you Emmanuel
So yeah I’m hopin’ that you're likin' the flow but it's only so you could know that God I’m writing it for let's go...
After it’s over, after it ends, after the music stops, what then?
Will you understand that Christ is King? Or will you just like the words we sing after the music stops
Discipleship is our call but we make disciples, this is not a suggestion, create disciples.
The teachin' is a process, it's not over night and it’s not a stage and a mic nah, it's life on life Christ -
Walked with twelve, ate with twelve, talked with twelve, shaped the twelve, invested in 'em well you could say that he made the twelve. Who made many more, who made plenty more, now it's on you and me if there's anymore
we share a common view like synoptic Gospels
I pray that everybody playin’ this song will be challenged by everything I had to say in this song
I don’t do this for the money, I don’t do this for fame, I don’t do this so the industry can know my name, I do this and host to glorify Yeshua the King, if you’re feelin’ me you know you should be doin’ the same let’s go…
