Candy paint
P-piece of chain
Money stacks
D-diamond ring
People playing that price of vain
Me, I just want the finer things
Haters hate
P-people change
Lost the family, f-face the pain
Before death take my breath away
I just want the finer things
Look, You want a piece of chain? I want a peace of mind
I had money in the bank while pops is dying
I can get more money can't buy no time, huh
In a room trying not to cry
Spent quality time so I'm good
Could've been out waxing that hood
Of my foreign car, like some sort of star
Stead of giving my time like I should, huh
You wanna know what's cool?
A daddy dropping his kids off at school
And when his kids is grown with kids of they own
And say my daddy ain't raise no fool
Sometimes, I sit on a plane full of pain
Care less about a grammy or the fame
I just want to see my kids change
And give up my art for their heart
That's gain
Mayne, so tell me what you making?
Money or a difference
What's yo' excuse and yo' mission?
When nobody remembers my name
Or the clothes I wore to that thing
I still rest in peace with my sanity
For them lives I got to help change
[Verse 2: Tedashii]
Red carpet in my armani suit
Sitting V.I.P. with ya' favorite group
Bad chicks, actress
R&B diva catch a fever while I'm leaving out the back quick
Now, tell me that won't boost your arrogance
Exactly
Maasai tactics
I did that, but I ain't get jack
Just enough for the bluff, so try to help you might get jack
And man that's truth, so get back
Cuz' they hit back
Let me help you
