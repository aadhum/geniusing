Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Send me I'll go
Lemme go lemme go!
I seen it with my own two
They never heard of Jesus
Heard of Young Buck, Lil' Wayne, and Young Jeezy
No one's signing up to go on missions this summer
Rather sit at home and watch X-zibit pimpin' a Hummer
No bridge illustrations for criminals who on lock down
People deep in Africa
Looking for an answer bruh'
In China man
They're dying man
Until they know who died for sins
So look what grace did
Not for us to stay hid
Inside our comfort zones
At home in mama's basement
I know y'all read the Great Commission
Let me just remind y'all:
Make disciples of the nations
Hey! After 1,000 years in the West and the church is
Get'n bigger daily
Without understand'n worship. (say what?)
America ain't Christian they just practice'n the ritual
That's why we should be missional
Lord I wanna stock up
Pack a bag and walk up
In a country where sharin' my
Faith may get me shot up
I know they're dyin' in the streets over in the Middle East
Some kids seekin' peace
Others hold'n up a piece
The great commission says make disciples of all nations
Have we even made them in our own nation?
Come on Christians!
Missions exist because worship doesn't
People don't worship the god that made them
We're ambassadors
Let's go!
