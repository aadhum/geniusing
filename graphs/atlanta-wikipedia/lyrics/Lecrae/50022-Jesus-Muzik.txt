Yeah, back on the grind again
I know it’s been a little while but it’s time again
Folks asking "Crae, when ya gonna rhyme again?"
I’m like, hold up, give me time, my man
See a lot of things change some stay the same
Went from H Town to D Town to Memphis man
One thing that’s for sure
Everywhere I go people caught up in their self, money, cars and clothes
They talk about it all the time and put it in they songs
They drive around and play it loud like it ain’t nothin’ wrong
And all they talk about is sinful stuff
Got everybody actin' bad, thinking that they a thug
They tryna drown me out, but nah they ain’t gon count me out
I got a back pack full of tracks plus I keep a Johnny Mac
So we can pound it out
Plus I’m bumpin' these Jesus beats
Whenever they seeing me
People lookin' all confused
Cause every one of my tunes is screamin' Jesus peeps
I was bumpin' that Trip Lee, BJ rollin' with me
Both our heads noddin' like we dozin or we tipsy
But we ain’t been drinkin' man
Nah this song just bangin' mane
Got us screamin' Jesus out the window
While we changin' lanes, while we just
Ridin' with my top down, listening to this Jesus music
If you hear that the bass bang and you see us in ya streets
That stuff ya boy’s playin' man it’s gon' be them Jesus beats
That stuff we bumpin' ain’t that lean with it rock with it
It’s that change ya life and please let the rock hit it
Christ 116 all proud to Christ was once lost
Then found now we down with Christ
In the start hearts dark but we found the light now it’s soundin' right
In the past I don’t think y'all understood now ya got it messed up
Let us all in ya hood we got the windows down and when we finna cruise
We bump that Cross Movement
We bump that Lampmode
It might be screwed and chopped
It might be east coast
Either way this Jesus music's Hot
You like music from rap to gospel
But ya prolly never heard nobody rap the gospel
Different sound but the truth’s the same
No choirs no bands but the truth remains
We got fam and the clique set the booth aflame
Like Duce and Flame if ya lost in the flow don’t lose the name
This ain’t entertainment dawg it’s timeless truth
If in our car you hear that boom-bap
And you hear some dude’s rap
It ain’t them folks that boast
It’s folks that tell you where the truth’s at
We don’t wanna hear about dimes and dope (nope)
We don’t wanna hear about nines and smoke
We don’t wanna hear about movin packs and foolish cats
Who lie and boast
We do wanna hear about Christ the king
Do wanna hear how lives is changed
We do wanna hear how God is pleased
And theology out the Bible man
This Jesus music turn heads, so turn it up and let em know
In all we do he’s first and, this Jesus music’s better bro (yeah)
