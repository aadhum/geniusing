In my garden in my garden
To keep and care it you've got to water it
To keep and care it you've got to water it
She ain't never seen Garden of Eden
Only seen garden of bleeding
And some are gonna lie and hate and make her feel like she's a heathen
Black rose
Their roots dirty but their petals stay pretty
Somebody tried to take the purity say they unworthy
The black rose grows deep in the city streets
But them stems still peak up under the concrete yeah
Bleak is around looking life but them never seen a flower
Grow under the moonlight
Mama had me readin Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice
I was looking for identity they stole mine twice
So I turn to the rude boy gangsters first
Man the school system it fail us, and the government won't bail us
But God sent people who reflect the light of the sun they get it done
And when all seems lost the Gardener intervenes
He handles her with care
And then thorns are a defense mechanism she'll never need
