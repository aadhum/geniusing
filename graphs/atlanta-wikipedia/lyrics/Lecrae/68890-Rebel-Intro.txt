Yeah
Just wanna dive into the beat
Swim around in it
Lets rebel
Rebel, I'm in rebellion
Yeah, to all my Rebels out there
Rebelling against the culture, being transformed
Not conformed to the ways of this world, or this age
Welcome to the Rebel-ution
Jesus was a rebel, a renegade outlaw
Sanctified trouble maker, but he never sinned, naw
And he lived his life by a different set of rules
The culture ain't approve so you know they had to bruise him
That's the way they do, man they swear they so gangsta
Everyone the same, everybody do the same stuff
Tattoos, piercings, smoking up and drinking
Money and sex, plus them extravagant weekends
Man if that's the high life of puff puff pass that
I guess I'm past that, I'm in rebellion
Rather have a dollar in my pocket than a million
I'm scared to worship money and my wants over Elyon
If Jesus is the truth that means one of us is very wrong
Think about it
[Spoken Sample]
But everyone is sinning, so it’s no longer rebellious to sin
You either love him or you leave him alone
But you can't do both
Yeah I know you heard that once in a song
And I rap the bread of life because they dying to eat
Cause you refuse to conform won't eat the king's meat
He eating with the sinners,
Your boy got a wife, and no I never cheated
I'm praying for humility whenever I get heated
Forget about the drugs, rebel against pornography
This ain't how it ought to be homie its how its gotta be
[Spoken Sample]
You’re just a conformist, if you're drunk and naked and driving around on a loud motorcycle smoking cigarettes and breaking commandments
And getting pregnant out of wedlock
Everyone's done that, it's so tiring
If you really want to be a rebel, read your Bible, because no one is doing that
That’s rebellion
That’s the only rebellion left
