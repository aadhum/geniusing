Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let them know
Aye, you can't stop me now
Aye, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know you can't stop me now
And I was so depressed, I was such a mess
I couldn't shake it off
Another murder on the television
Man, somebody go turn it off
I spoke my mind, I got attacked for it
Thought these people had my back boy
Then they tellin' me I asked for it
I guess I'm just another black boy
And then they killed Tamir Rice
And they just go on with they life
They tellin' me shut up talking 'bout it
Like, I should just talk about Christ
But the truth is I started to doubt God
I started to question my purpose
I started to act out
I ain't wanna sign another autograph or give a fake smile
Doctors told me that my man died
I almost had a breakdown
Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let 'em know
Aye, you can't stop me now
Aye, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know, aye, you can't stop me now
This my identity, this what He give to me
I'm glad that Jesus ain't American
And that's the reason why I care again
People started praying for me
And homies tellin' me I was being arrogant
And even though we get killed
I know that God got a greater plan
For the death and blood that we spill
Hey, all those feelings of depression and doubt
You gotta tell 'em go away
You've gotta say get out the way
And let 'em know
Aye, you can't stop me now
Aye, and you throw up both hands way back
And then you sail away
Yeah, you've gotta ride the wave
Let 'em know, aye, you can't stop me now
