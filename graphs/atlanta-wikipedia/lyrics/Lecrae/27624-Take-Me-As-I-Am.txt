Grace through faith
I talked to a cat the other day
And he was like; "Man I really wanna come to Christ
But I gotta clean my life up first, get my sins together"
I told 'em, I used to think that way too
I thought I had to change myself before I could come to Christ
But Christ changed me, let me tell you my story, it starts like this
It's 5:46 in the mornin', tossin' and turnin'
Chest burnin', sermons in my head keep reocurrin'
Cryin' at the feet of the Father, for all the wrong things that he did
Now I'm sweatin' in my sheets can't sleep
My mind keeps tellin' me I'm six feet deep
The way I'm living my life I feel I'm going to hell
That you had to leave the world, cause the world left you
So I make believe there really is a heaven for a G
Even though they say you loved the world so much
You shed ya blood, God I feel I'm too messed up for love
They tell me come as I am but I smell like smoke
My whole life's full of sin, cause it's all I know
The bible told me that you died for my sins
If I believe in Christ, it'll save me from the end
But I'm scared to ask you, to save me my heart so evil
I got thoughts, that's full of hatred, hurtin' people
I thought at first I had to clean up my life
Now I'm hear, and I just need to cling to the light
I'm ready to do it, but Lord I pray you understand
My life is a mess, will you take me as I am
Will you take me as I am
I know the way I'm living is wrong
But I can't change on my own, trying to make it alone
I wonder, how could you love me when my life so ugly
But you came down and died for me
I'm sick and tired of trying to be the man
My daddy never taught me to be
I made many mistakes in my past I can't fix
Now I'm staring at this crucifix tatted on my wrist
Is it true what they telling me, am I just crazy
Did you bleed on the cross for my sins to save me
But why would ya die for me
My whole life I've been working for Satan, while he fed lies to me
Figure Hell is what I deserve, But your word says we all fall short
So I guess we all ought to burn
No matter my past, you'll still take me as I am
This life is passing us by, I got no reason to lie
More security than the man that left you
More love than the moms who kept you
Let Christ rule ya heart, mind, body and soul cause He chose you
And if the world don't know you, it don't matter you're Gods child, And He'll never disown you
And it don't matter if the world don't seen us
We still mean the world to Jesus
So if you feel like you gotta clean yourself up
Before you can come to Him, forget it, just come to Him
He'll take you as you are, and he'll change you
From the inside, out
