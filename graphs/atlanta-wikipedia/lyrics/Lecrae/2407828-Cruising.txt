But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'
But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'
But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'
But I, keep cruisin', cruisin', cruisin'
I woke up, kinda late
All good, thank God
Hit the shower, hit the closet, hit the mirror, stay fly
Really I'm rockin' some sweats
Oh well, I'm still feelin' blessed
Get fully dressed, walk in the kitchen
She already made me a plate, kinda impressed
And that sun shinin', it's good weather I'm feelin' good
Got the good book, I'ma read up
Put my feet up and then hit the hood
On the street like fifteen minutes and the lights stay green
Slow down, speed got limits
But I'm cruisin', knee-deep in it
At the car wash, cleaned the Jeep and found a ten dollar bill in between the seats
I gave it to the man on the corner
Had a sign up sayin' he was hungry
Cruisin', feelin' good, yo
I remember livin' in the hood bro
Death rate high and the funds low
When I used to get by on crumbs bro
Went to the park to get the scoop
Saw the home boys out there shootin' hoop
And my shot kinda rusty but the fade clean
And me and Steph Curry on the same team
Win it like back to back
Nobody really want it after that
Feelin' like a young Doctor J
They can't stop the J, they can't block my pace
It's true that they can't stop the rain of my shot today
So when she hit my phone I had to stop the game
Later on, time to eat
Favorite restaurant, open seat
Sunset, the scenery
Told my lady, "Lean on me"
After that jump in the whip and we in a wind
Tomorrow may not be another win
But until then I'ma keep on moving
Cool it, I'ma keep cruising
