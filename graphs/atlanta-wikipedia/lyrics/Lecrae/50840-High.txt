Turn my beat up, overdose mine
I don’t need drugs, got the Most High
Holy Ghost writer to compose rhymes
Sin got us blind, got a cloud on our minds
I’m illuminated open up my eyes
Now the Spirit showin me the Word is alive
I was so low, now I’m so high
Regenerated mind telling me that I’m alive
And it’s workin, I’m so certain
Confident He created me for a purpose
Somewhere in-between the jeans that yall jerkin'
And them khakis that gansta's work-workin
No purpose sir so worthless
Hi-high turn the treble, bass-bass up
I’m tryna see the Son that’s why I got my face up!
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn-turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
Turn the treble up, bass on high
I got my pride on low faith-faith on high
All my people in the building get cha hands up high
Get em high-i-i-i-high high
Get em high-i-i-i-high-high, high
I'mma stand behind my bars like a inmate
And I promise I do the things that my pen say
God’s sensei, I'm in the dojo
World full of them sheep with the sharp teeth
I don’t need a buzz, I don’t need to shine
Already sky high, I think I see the top
Hello, hand’s high like His name
I been purchased by the blood homie I can show you change
Back in the day I saw a girl (iMac)
Try to get those digits call her later (iChat)
I rehab now got my eyes on the Throne
Whenever I talk to the Lord, iPhone
Then build a damnation like a beaver
All men fall short like Keibler
Elf, Gary Coleman, Webster, and Lil' Ceaser
