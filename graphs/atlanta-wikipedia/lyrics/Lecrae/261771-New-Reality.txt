See, He remembers the first day that He made you
Moldin' your lungs for the breath that He gave you
Not to mention the day He saved you
Or when He opened your eyes by the Spirit, Christ was raised through
Did I mention that He forgave you?
Cold water we drink
Hot water we cook
But lukewarm does nothin' it just sits and it looks
And that's you,
imagine these as the words of Christ
If you realize you livin' in sin
Just confess and realize you're forgiven of sin
