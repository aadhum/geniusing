I said I'll never leave you But I'm so left
I ain't right Lord I'm sleeping with death
I'm drinking out a broken cistern
I'm fellin' schizophrenic maybe I ain't saved
Cause I gotta get high just to block out all the pain
You were stabbed you were murdered and for me is why you bled
But I spit on your bloody face as If I never cared
And Lord how dare I compare my pain
I don't know why you did it that I can't explain
How can you love this sinner whose desecrated your name
I don't know if I know you But still I know I should
I've come to this conclusion I would like to change
Cause all the worlds money and fame cannot sustain
Cause do I really feel that havin' Jesus is my gain
Satan is a beast
All I need here is you help me turn away from sin
I know I don't deserve
