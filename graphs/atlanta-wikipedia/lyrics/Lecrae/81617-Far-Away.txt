Far Far Away (You feel) Far Away. (You Seem) Far Away.. So So (x2)
Hopeless!
I can spell it
I can smell it in the air
Lotta people wonder if you still care
And are you still there
Cuz I dun lost it all
I keep calling your name
But do you hear my call
And are you still involved
Or am I left alone
I wander the streets
Cuz I no longer have a home
My brothers all GONE
My sisters all GONE
My families and my friends ain't gonna be here in the Mornin
Ya see me hear mourning
They say you feel my pain
They say you went through it
Say to die is to gain
But I ain't gain nothing
I lost everybody
Now Im losing my mind
And my faith is all Im counting
Im still holding on
Thats why Im still pray
Feelin empty inside
I can't make it through today
I dont know what else to do
I dont know what else to say
Im talking to ya now
But I promise you feel so far
Dear hope: Been waitin on ya for a while now
Been cut so deep that I ain't sure if I can smile now
Look at this devastation
Look at the pain and sorrow
Somebody fed me lies and promised me a bright tomorrow
I know the God I follow
Is bigger than disaster
Big enough to handle
Any evil that harasses us
But I feel like he passed us
Pain overtook us
Buildings tumble over head
As the ground shook us
God have you forsook us
[Interlude]
For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence
For my hope is from him
He only is my rock and my salvation
My fortress; I shall not be shaken
On God rests my salvation and my glory;
My mighty rock, my refuge is God
Trust in him at all times, O people; pour out your heart before him;
God is a refuge for us
