I don't know if I should call Christ
Buddha, or Mohammed
Gettin' blunted earlier this evenin' now seems wrong
Man, you never understood before man
You've lied before right? Okay right
You've stolen before right?
Well man you've already broken two of the ten commandments, man
That qualifies you as, a lawbreaker
That's, that's sin, man
That offends the holy and perfect and righteous God, man
That's sin, you need a savior because of the sin, man
And God so loved the world...
What's the rest of that verse?
Think fast, can't remember
Help me nurse!
"What's John 3:16, nurse?
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son.."
Gave up His only son
Okay yeah that's right
So whoever believes in Him
