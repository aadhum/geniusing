Yeah ok see uh it's a lot of cats goin' around talkin' 'bout they the king, ya know what I'm sayin'? The king of this the king of that. Well I think we need to get this straight, there's only one true king,
ay Flame come help ya boy out man let's get into this one man yeah
He was raised up in Nazareth and raised on the thizzerd
Never got drunk, got high, or sipped sizzurp
Prophesied King, Isaiah 9, that's the wizzerd
He's the real king, and it don't matter what you hizzerd
A king's a real shepherd dawg
Acts in peoples' favor ya'll
Not a self seekin' player all about the paper dawg
Call 'em the Messiah, the Annointed One
the Savior
Caught Him on the humble but you'll see Him reign later
These self-proclaimed kings braggin' cause they on chrome
But twenty-six inches is a pretty low throne
Like kids playin' in they daddy's clothes when he's gone
The clothes don't fit and daddy's comin' back home
The King of kings is comin' back
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King, Jesus Christ rule this thing)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (He the King)
Who the King? (Jesus Christ run it mane)
