This song right here
Is for everybody out there looking for truth
Who says, you know
We all in the same boat
Yeah, Christians and Muslims, everybody like that, huh
Yow, you lookin' for truth
Oh, I've got some answers man
So good to be
Ah, let's get into it
Night and day, I ain't scared to say that we different
King Agrippa
Whitley and Wayne
They say we look the same but we ain't chasin' the same thing
It all boils down to they think everything's relative
Jesus might as well be a South American president
That's the Bible the one they quote
But they don't care about the author they think He's a joke
But that means you believe your own statement; that there's no way to know what's really true
You're saying that that statement is true
You're killing yourself. If what's true for you is true for you and what's true for me is true for me, what if my truth says yours is a lie?
Is it still true? Come on man!
Than self-satisfaction, hedonism and pleasing things
Life's about you gettin' yours and bein' happy
Even if it means a divorce and switchin' families?
See, he gave you breath to breathe, the chest to breathe it
So you can taste and see He's the best, believe it
He made us for His glory and not for your own homie
We're just the result of a big cosmic explosion
We're created with purpose man! Get with The Creator y'all!
But some say they roll with Christ, cause some rappers made it seem like He was cool with all the sin in their life
No!
What you thought last night deserved a first class flight
To Hell
you ain't know that it cost that price
All of God's anger poured on His son
Ain't got a beef with God because the Son was crushed
