Welcome to H-Town, yeah
Welcome to H-Town, whoa
They say them boy's riding clean
But without the King, what does it really mean
Cup full of lean
got a sweet for the green
Wake up, boy this ain't a dream
Welcome to H-Town
[Verse 1: Tedashii]
Fell in love with a harsh road at my auntie house
Candy paint,
Gripping wood grain
always sipping good, man
I was down for whatever, wished somebody would mayne
looking pretty like a bad yellow bone
Th-Th-Throwed in the game
It's like the world stood still when we bought them grey tapes
Ch-chop chopped screwed,
I was born in H-Town,
starched down way back
When the slabs in the city beat that screw off in the back
eating Frenchy's chicken dinner
Family came from 3rd Ward Scott Street on up to Ennis
Hanging out on Sunnyside with my cousin Corel
They was on that purple Sprite,
I was still sipping 40s
Keke's
next
I told my cousin D at TSU
I smoke trees
And, man, I love the city of my birth, that's why I plea
That God will change the H the same way He's changing me!
A pocket full of green, and find a bad
yellow
My bros riding dirty, know your soul ain't clean
And gon' let the Lord intervene!
Welcome to H-Town
I had a dream on the plane that I was sitting in the slabs
Seat back, bass up,
chunking deuce and giving dap
Talking to my partners 'bout these plans that I have
dope
things
dope
Pass the kill
And as I got higher, death is what I started to feel "dog, we smokin' kill"
I backed away from the killer, He picked up my life and my vision got clearer
Destiny is screamin' it's faint
But the man in the mirror is trying to make a change,
H-Town, I still love you, hold up, man
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Uh now what y'all know about them Texas boys
Now what y'all know about them Texas boys
