Hey 'Crae, I hear they tryin' to blow
Money fast right?
We ain't tryin' diss nobody, but
They gon' talk drugs, let's give
Em' that Overdose
I'm feelin' good, forget my feeling tho
Let's talk about my fillin', filled with tha Holy Ghost
And I ain't talkin' smoke, I'm talkin' fire
I'm tryna' shock the world, before they cut my wires
Boy that Word of God get at you like a Twitter name
But you don't hear me tho, you used to different speakers
They speak death and they stories ain't at all the truth
They like to think they ballers, they just some foul shooters
I know how fake feel i dropped him off at the clinic
Told em he need rehabilitation (gone take him) get him clean
Met that Triune Light (what's that?) triple beam
They think I'm churchy, they think ya boy a lame
Yeah I live for Jesus, I'm unashamed
They talkin' reckless what you spectin' from the walkin' dead
Eat His Flesh drink His Blood, Holy Communion
I know the Truth is hitting home like Barry Bonds
Yeah my God run the streets like a marathon
They ask me where to find the Lord they ain't never seen Him
Homie, God ain't got no longitude or latitude
He's on another level you can't put a ladder to
