Okay, I get it, I know, I get it
Okay, I get it, I know what they thinkin'
Okay, I get it, I know, I get it
Okay, I get it, I know what they thinkin'
I'm rooted, boy I thought you knew it
Tell you where we been by, show you how we do it
That truth will rearrange ya, have you looking like a stranger
Change a banger to a husband and a father, I ain't playin'
It's game time like Sunday
Okay, I get it, I know what you thinkin'
We some kum-ba-yah Christians, that memo I must've missed it
