Hmm, Here we go again
Why you blowing them stems
I'm bout' to flow again
I know the smoke ain't the only thing going in
I gotta whole lotta truth you can roll'em with
Feel it in your chest, yes, breath
It's what you breathe in never thinkin' that you blessed
Your body feeling right but your soul getting left
You think you gettin' high but you really getting low
The devil got you blind from the weed that you blow
You worshippin' a tree instead of worshippin' the king
When he made everything Romans 1:23
Chase that high all the way to into the grave
You lost in your low so you're high everyday
And everything you crave only makes you a slave
And Christ is the only way you ever gonna 'scape
You got one life and it ain't gon' last
You ain't stimulated, you manipulated by a hater
And he hate it when you rehabilitated
Ohh, you think you high but you really getting low
Yeah, you gon' hate it but I had to let you know
That in the end we all gon' die, can't escape it if you try
I know your lighters up but I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!)
I'mma blow your high (Eyyy!) I'mma blow your high
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
And Jesus is alive
Everybody wanting satisfaction
But there's no regard for The One who has it
And everybody wantin' grabbin'
But you gotta get it from above where they stash it
You can try to get high
You can feel alive
But the reality, your soul dry
You gotta find anybody with a better high
Gotta make a U-turn cause if you turn
You can see The One who turns
But if we never make that turn
You will never be content with the high you've earned
For the love of kush
You can either be a slave to an object
Or rather be a slave to the God who's honest
They ain't never seen a high like I got
But they fallin' in the puddle like a raindrop
I know you're trying to free your mind
But you just wasting time
The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
Who by the unrighteousness suppress the truth
For although they knew God, they did not honor Him or give thanks to Him
They became futal in their thinking
They exchanged the truth of God for a lie
And worshipped and served the creature instead of the Creator who is blessed Forever
Amen
