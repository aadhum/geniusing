A yo man let that beat drop on em
Yea, oh you know I'm liking that right there
Wats good yall
It's yo boy Lecrae
Some call me creezy
I'm here with my 116 clique representatives
We just want to put it down for the Lord Jesus Christ
City to city and state to state, we keep running into more 116 clique members
People who are unashamed of the gospel of Jesus Christ
Let me tell you where we're from dogâ€¦
New Jerusalem, that's my home
All they rhyme about is guns, money, sex and drugs
Eighty percent of these dudes is fictional thugs
We don't kill nobody, we don't rob no stores
We don't trap, we ain't strapped, we don't smoke that dro
We ain't pimpin, we ain't trippin, if we tippin on some fours
Then youll probaly hear dat Jesus music comin out our doors(comin out our doors)
We ain't ashamed
you can call us lame
But everybody gotta die and stand in front of the King
We unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, we unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
Unashamed, unashamed
We unashamed
Ma Jesus, Jesus, ma Jesus might make a great tune
But we gotta lead em dip sets to the weight room
While being vocal by the Lord and not a piece or a chain
He fasted from speaking even with nails bashed in His feat, and the cross
But like the rims that hit the curb (curb) we call em shoulder blades
We got our crosses on our back like our shoulder blades
