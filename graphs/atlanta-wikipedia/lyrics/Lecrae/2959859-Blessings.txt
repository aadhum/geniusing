If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
Won't take that credit, I know where we get it
Them blessings be comin' from God above
I remember pushin' mama's little white Hyundai with no gas money
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'
I'm just tryna talk about the benefits
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
All I needed was the Mary Mary
But the God in me was havin' commentary, woo!
I got angels all around like Anita Baker
Tell my haters I confess
Treat 'em like the green bubbles on the iPhone
I probably never read the message
If I ever took a loss, I learned a lesson
I won't ever think I'm better than the next man
