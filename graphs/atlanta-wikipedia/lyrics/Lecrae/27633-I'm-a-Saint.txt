Yeah they tell me sugar coat it, dumb it down but I can't
Might as well could deny the Jesus and be ashamed but I ain't...imma saint
Til the day I see the grave I'm going hard in the paint
It's the only We hope we got dats why I'll die for the faith I'mma saint
Used to be where I could only trust me and myself
Illiterate ain't know that the word came
But then that that light hit me and unblinded me
Jesus paid a price fo' me
that's how I gained the right ta be the son of God I'd like to be
Changed my heart and gave me a desire for his work mayne
Kill me if you want but I'm gone get back out that dirt mayne
Not yet what I'm gonna be but not what I used to be
I might say that I love Jesus but that talk was really fake
Be lustin for ya cousin if it wasn't for his Grace
Yeah he took me outta nothin and he made ya boy a saint
back in eternity
He ain't just agree he fulfilled it to the death of em
He took that bloody
Cup that's meant for us str8 to the neck and yeah
He swallowed all that
Bitterness that pain and affliction
Ain't a soul in hell with pain comparable to this one
blood purchased
See some believe they can fly
He will march through the sky while the stars sing his praises
The planets
Dance around and the universe is amazed
And me I get to gaze upon his beauty for days
You might think I'm crazy like some kinda urban misfit
But first I hated church I'd only pray to give my wish list
I'd be just like you doing my dougie in the club folk
I promise I ain't it choose it I was chosen to loved on
Eyes low
blowing dro
that's the life I used to know
Then I met the great I am
Son of Man or the Lamb
All that arrogance and pride I dead em and fo'get em
