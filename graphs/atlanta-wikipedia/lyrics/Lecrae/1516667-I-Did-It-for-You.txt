(Verse 1: Lecrae)
Big momma making a fuss saying in God she trusts
My uncles 20, I'm 10 taking gulps of gin
He don't realize that we all are engulfed in sin
By 25 everybody locked or dead
Turn their heads towards the sky trying to ask God why
But they never looked up till then
Every other day they concerned with the world and consumed in sin
Not Christ just heaven they want
Changing channels from videos back to cartoons
That's what I learned late one night
When a man named James White changed my life
He told me that Christ paid the price for sin
Every lie I ever told Christ died for them
