Gunnin' Gunnin', Gunnin'
Everybody want something for their nothing
We live in a cold, cold world
These folks is killin for less money than they can borrow
Create annual Sorrow for families left feeling hollow
Then the son of a gun victim flashing out his anger
Colorin cartoons of strangers who're getting strangled
And a daughter let a stranger, the school call him counselor
Do some dirty things,
but he promise that he will counsel her
Baby momma can't identify the man that killed him
It's the same low town dealer that she always get the pills from
And the son is getting older, streets are making him colder
But his momma's out cold, cause she ain't never quite sober
His sister 15, but you probably think that she grown up
Cause she was with some men, acting way too grown up
And don't nobody care though, the schools ain't teaching
McDonald's selling poison, got people working for cheap and
The military, drug's, or prison the only way to eat, man
It's cold in the streets, let the track bring the heat in
This world's cold like no clothes and snow blowing
Like when the devil take the breath out of a baby's nose
And the people won't hear more metaphors and word-play
My sister's sick of stripping, she need hope up in my words, man
She pull up to the mall and she valet her lil' Mercedes
Wishing she had some romance, healthy family, couple babies
And the gentleman she love, he already got a wife
So she's accepting her plight, she's the lady of the night
And she saw him in the park with his daughter, they're holding hands
Arm around his woman's shoulder, he ain't give her not a glance
She accepts her sad reality, she doesn't stand a chance
One woman gets the man, another woman gets the dance
It's a cold world, real cold world
Jermaine called that thing, man where is we going turn
A lot of people thinking I'm on an hopeless endeavor, nah
I know someone who can change the weather forever, ever
