I'm not the standard at all and wouldn't claim to be
But since Christ
Snatched me up theres been a lot of change in me
I keep accountabilty 'cause my flesh, yeah, it loves to fail
I got my number changed twice for the girls that I used to know
I don't trip when I pass the cops
Cause I'm not making assists; you know
Trying to pass the rock
I don't live life scared of death
Cause when I take my last breath
The next step is there in text
Galatians
Ephesians
We shouldn't be confused with the heathens
hit a lick
Man I don't trip of coppin' whips
I ain't worried chains or shoes
My God's thinkin' bout whether to change the
City sky from greys to blues
I don't even wanna change the game
Your favorite rapper got saved last night, yeah, that's the aim
The world we're livin' in is simply tempting
So I quit consenting to my flesh
When it tries to pimp me
Who wiped my sin slate clean like Oxy 10
I rock Christ from PA to Dallas
R-Swift and Lecrae walk in the Spirit til our feet ache with callous
Naw I'm buggin
With
where blasted shots cause cats
To drop like temperatures
Without Christ and restoration
Your chance of makin it is slimmer than Blacks
Getting reparations
Jesus Christ man the Ancient of Days
