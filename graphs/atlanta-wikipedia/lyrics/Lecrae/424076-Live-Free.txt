Free from sin
But morals and music you want them separate
Like garnish on the side something y'all don't mess with
A soap box for lots of young and restless
(tell the world) I'm gone... I'm gone!
They walk in the church dressed flyer than sea birds, she came to see him he hopin' to see her
They motives ain't right and they heart ain't either
And over God they choose to feed they fever
See he don't understand that It's Christ who bled for
Every second glance every turn of his head yo
And she don't really get that
Jesus did that
For every time she fantasize about his six pack
They sure like Al B
To connect like his brows be
