Open your eyes
You'll see the light that burns inside
Is bright as the sky
It could light up the night
'Cuz you were born to illuminate
Light em up (x11)
You can find me on the west side, do or die, suicide
Who them guys, you and I are witnessin' the power of the unified
You decide, you a liar if you denyin' who's survivors
Who's the riders, the crew behind us
Y'all still on that truth or dare, we on true to die
You can crucify us
We gon' fight until our time is over
We can't stop, can't take no photos
Out here rollin', road to glory, homie
Man, they can't stop us, they can't beat us
We undefeated every time we meet up
When it's heatin' up you know it's winning season
Open your eyes
You'll see the light that burns inside
Is bright as the sky
It could light up the night
'Cuz you were born to illuminate
Light em up (x11)
I used to wonder what I live for
Till I found out what I was here for
I found a reason I'm alive for
I'm only here to help the people turn they lights on
Ain't no sense in lookin' back, ain't no sense in lookin' back
I see your light, your Edison is evident
And you been shinin' ever since
Don't ever flinch, cuz your element is excellence
And everything else is irrelevant
What's your contribution to the world when you stagnant
You feel that mission in your stomach, you sittin' absent
Spotlight, limelight, it ain't light work, it's hard work
The way the lights work is you grind hard in them dark times and let the Light work
High life ain't the highlight since the hustle that's behind it
Get your mind right when you struggle through the dark you shinin' brightest
Open your eyes
You'll see the light that burns inside
Is bright as the sky
It could light up the night
'Cuz you were born to illuminate
Light em up (x11)
