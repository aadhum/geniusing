Yeah she may look gritty
When her man come back she gone look so pretty
You might see her acting crazy, be patient with her tho cause she still God's baby
She ain't bricks and buildings
She all of God's people Men women and children
A building of beings being constructed
Christ is the cornerstone, foundation build on another and you's a goner holmes
She' built on em, supported by him, conformed to him, now she's a body of bodies who transform through him
A temple that breathes we are the halls
We are the floor board or more we are the walls
One flesh union homie
The Tri-union is glorified through our corporatized communion
Folks catch her slippin and they turn away disgusted
She's a work in progress Christ is the head of her
She's a world changer but ain't bout getting rich
And sometimes her body parts start acting outa place
Legs tryna be arms
Arms thinking they the face
But she'll never be replaced with a one man band or a small Taliban with no body in command
Some don't get it so they hate
They say she's on a paper chase they say she's really fake
So they go start a ministry so they can do the work
But they don't understand how Jesus feel about His church
No church structure
No elders and no discipline
They don't have a conductor
And they so they don't submit
Look at Ephesians 4 where Paul gets practical
1st Timothy
and Titus if you thinking I'm irrational
