(You just gotta know)
You ever feel like life just comin’ at ya a million miles an hour?
Somebody’s holdin’ it all together
Life is like an elevator, a lot of ups and downs
People pushin’ your buttons and gettin’ jerked around
I used to lurk around town tryin’ to work around
Workin’ so that I could hit the ground with the perfect sound
A lazy Jay-Z hopin’ rock-a-fellas paid me
Or rockin’ ladies were caught me a Mercedes
Missed that shot like the cop that’s crooked
Even though I’m five years past grown
If Heaven ain’t a gift, then I ain’t getting’ in (man)
I can’t even find the words for the way I feel
So I paint a picture, I paint a picture
I’ve been goin’ down this road, seen some crazy things
So I paint a picture, you gots to see it
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
You just gotta know
(Yeah) I sit and hear the guitars play
Wonder if they could, what would stars say or Venus and Mars say
Or say that we want it our way
Stars so desperate to shine that they go on livin’ the hard way
The intellect to travel to Mars but so blind
We worship Venus but she don’t even know who we are
And she never cared why, cuz she wasn’t there
When I was tryin’ to drown my sorrows in a pool of despair
I ain’t perfect, sometimes I feel worthless
Worth less than that is the image that I’da purchased
Man, from the shades to the shirt to the shoes
Just another fool tryin’ to cover he’s confused, that ain’t cool
Sometimes I hate the man in the mirror
Cuz I know he’s a liar and a cheater and a killer
People say they love him but they love what he can give ‘em
But deep inside he knows that there’s a reason for him livin’
You know I need you like aqua
Day without ya got me so nauseous
If I ain’t cautious, I’m gonna self-inflict my sickness
But then I heard you went out of your way to adopt me
