God created days, weeks, summer, spring, winter, fall
Yet became weak so You could free us from the fall
You hold the earth in Your palm with Your great power
You're always out of time the way You transcend hours
More than auto tune, more than minor key
I holla empty me
So hollow be my name
You’re so immense
But condescend and dwell inside my frame
You restrain the waves
And tame fierce lions
And nothing under the sun can save us from it
There’s no hope but divine intervention
And Christ saves victims who are dying from addiction
They say in God we trust
But what’s the bigger sin
That we don’t trust in Him
But trust the stuff on which its written (that’s money)
It’s all needles in arms full of life’s drugs
Lust, pride, hate, death running through our blood
Need a blood donor, need a transfusion
He’s over hanging on the cross for your substitution
