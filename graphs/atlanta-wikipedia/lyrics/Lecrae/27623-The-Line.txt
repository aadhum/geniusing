You know it's on and poppin and ain't no stoppin
Keepin the party rockin for God who's watchin
Without Christ the Rock who would rock ya body
Who would rock the party, or rock the lobby
He gave us a reason to praise Him up in the Steeple
When He came down and died for the evil that we do
We ain't playin games or reppin His name to gain change
We do this to maintain and change the mainframe
Gangstas that gangbang and hustlas that slang thangs
We know you're a sinner but it's time for a name change
It's the Holy Rock Repper, reppin the Rock whether or
Not it's hot on ya block in the hot weather
We in the party screamin "Jesus WHUUUT"
You see somebody wildin out? what you seen was us
We keep it krunk for Christ because of His redeeming love
We gone rep him till we die or til He beams us up so get 'em up!
You rollin with the line now baby
Get your hands up high now baby
We keep it crunk for Christ, we'll never change that
The same cats rockin even after the cows came back (mmmmm)
Get your hands up, Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up
Tadow! How you like me now I'm in the mix
See I'm a fiend for Jesus Christ and I'm about ta get my fix
But you can't front on Jehovah, He knows ya...
Not J-A-Y but J-E young soldier
