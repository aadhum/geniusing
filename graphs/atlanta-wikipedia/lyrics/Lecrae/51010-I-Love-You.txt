Girl I love you
Cross my heart and hope to live
To make you
Smile
Cause I don't deserve you
For all the times you held me
Down
Listen to me now, I love you girl
You know I had to do a love song
my love y'all
We could be more like Sho Baraka
But we are Moore's and we been that
And when I said I do, I meant that
I'm dying everyday trying to be a better man)
I put that on my momma
I love the way you play your part through my drama
Long nights, long flights
Trips out of town
You keep my head up when it was hanging down
Down like four flats on a lack
Out here trying to save the world
Can't forget about my baby girl
Call you grace cause I don’t deserve you
You ain’t fussing you was there through the whole night
Saying it's alright
So faithful, far as beef yeah we done had a plateful
But we ate it up and we made it up
Cause our view of the Lord wasn’t great enough
Thank God my rib's the best part of me
And how she's every woman everywhere
