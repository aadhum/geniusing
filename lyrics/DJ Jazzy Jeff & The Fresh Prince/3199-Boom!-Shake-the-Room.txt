Yo back up now and give a brother room
The fuse is lit and I'm about to go boom
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wildin'
Standing in a crowd of girls like a island
I flip her around and then I work that booty
Hold up, yo let's get just one thing clear
There's only one reason why I came here
I came here tonight to hear the crowd go
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Boom! shake, shake, shake the room)
(Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom)
The rhyme is a football y'all and I went and threw it
Out in the crowd and yo it was a good throw
How do I know?, because the crowd went (HO)
In response to the way that I was kicking i
the Dr. Jekyll man and this is my 'Hyde' side
The F-f-f-f-Fresh P-p-p-p-Prince is who I am
So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam
But sometimes I get n-nervous and start to stutter
And I f-fumble every word, for word I utter
So I just try to ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chill
But it gets worse-a but worse-a but-but-but worse still
I need the c-c-c-crowd to k-k-k-kick into it
They help me calm down and I can get through it
So higher higher, get your hands to the ceiling
Let it go y'all don't fight the feeling
Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pouring
And like Jordan yo I'm scoring
