(The magnificient) Jazzy Jeff
Well, it's true that I'm the reigning king of the throne
crossfade cut
Scratchin and mixin, mixin and scratchin
Second after second it's the record
He's catchin
His hands are so fast that it's a medical riddle
With the turntable split and the mixer in the middle
Back and forth his hands fly
With the speed of a cheetah that'll puzzle your
Eye
(tear yo butt limb from limb!)
His name is Jazzy Jeff a/k/a Jeff Townes
Now make it chirp
( *Jazzy Jeff transforms* )
