Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down
And
I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
the prince of
a town called Bel-Air
In west Philadelphia born and raised
Chillin' out max, and relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said you're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
Put my walkman on and said I might as well kick it
First class yo this is bad
Drinkin' orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air live like
Hmmm this might be all right
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8
And I yelled to the cabbie "yo homes smell ya later"
Looked at my kingdom I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air
