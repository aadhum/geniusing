It caught me off guard cause it happened so quick
Cruising down the highway, fast, not slow
Ninety miles an hour in my 5.0
People waving at me cause they know who I am
Alpine stero blasting a jam
Pinto coupe
She was still tailgating me too damn tight
To the left lane I tried to switch
Then you saw my blinker bitch
Wrinkled old bag lookin' like a shar pei
