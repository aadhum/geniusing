DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince
My rhymes have been written, not to be bitten
Stronger than a dinosaur
I mean the battles I battle, I usually win em
I'm the Real McCoy
If I was Fred Flintstone, I'd probably own all of Bedrock
If I was a criminal I'd probably own a cell block
a poet so I own the whole rap industry
That's when I snap and I'll attack and go mad like Rambo
Or maybe like Commando
or like Lando
Calrissian
cause you know he was down with the Force
If rap was basketball, I would be in luck
Cause every time I freestyled it would be a slam dunk
MAN, I'm the engineer, and you're the passangers
The Jason of rap
Freddy Kruger of rhymin
A hip-hop terrorist, war like vocalist
Other rappers say, "Yo Prince why don't you show me this
Style now," you must be trippin
It ain't no way in hell I'ma let you put your lip in
My rhyme cause it's a timebomb, I'm not kiddin
My rhyme explodes the second it gets bitten
I shop at Macy's
shop at Gimble's
