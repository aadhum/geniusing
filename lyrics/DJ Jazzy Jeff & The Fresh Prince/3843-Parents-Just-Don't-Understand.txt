They don't understand that us kids are gonna make some mistakes
It was me, my brother, my mom, oh, my pop, and my little sister
All hopped in the car
We headed downtown to the Gallery Mall
She said, "What's wrong? This shirt cost $20"
I said, "Mom, this shirt is plaid with a butterfly collar!"
And then she lost her mind and did the ultimate
I asked her for Adidas and she bought me Zips!
I said, "Mom, what are you doing, you're ruining my rep"
She said, "You're only sixteen, you don't have a rep yet"
She said "no, you go to school to learn not for a fashion show"
I said, "This isn't Sha Na Na, come on Mom, I'm not Bowzer
Mom, please put back the bell-bottom Brady Bunch trousers
You gotta put back the double-knit reversible slacks"
She said, "If they were laughing you don't need them
Cause they're not good friends"
For the next six hours I tried to explain to my Mom
That I was gonna have to go through this about 200 more times
Would they mind?
Umm, well, of course not
I pulled up to the corner at the end of my block
That's when I saw this beautiful girlie girl walking
I picked up my car phone to perpetrate like I was talking
You should've seen this girl's bodily dimensions
She said, "How do I know you're not sick?
You could be some deranged lunatic"
Besides, would a lunatic have a Porsche like this?
We hit McDonald's, pulled into the drive
And this girl's hand was steadily moving up my thigh
Come to find out the girl was a twelve-year-old runaway
I was arrested, the car was impounded
There was no way for me to avoid being grounded
I got my grip, I said, "Ah, Mom, Dad... how was your trip?"
I can't believe it, I just made a mistake
