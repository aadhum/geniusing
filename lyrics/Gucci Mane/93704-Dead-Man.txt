Call me Gucci Mane when I’m on the stage with you
But call me Jesse James when I hold this damn pistol
You can call me Gucci Guwop when I do a song with you
But don’t walk up on me homes, I ain’t finna blow no strong with you (x2)
And I can't turn you on, you must have the wrong picture
I'm in the VIP sippin' lean with this very long Swisher
Yous a Nicky Barnes ass nigga tryin to tell on Guy Fisher
Five deuce, four-tray, six eight
Eight watches, four chains six rings
Pots, forks: dope at a high cost
From coast to coast, I said numbers on the dope
Prices lower then Shawty Lo
when I drive
Got my seat leanin low bricks inside
Call the bricks snow like I was on bluff
Call me the master like Sho'Nuff
Money never sit still so my net don’t blow
King of the streets just call me sire
