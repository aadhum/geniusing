[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
Red bezel on my Jacob looking like a sliced tomato
I’m so extraordinary while my bracelet so canary
Choppers that my niggas carry probably scare the military
Half your budget spent on luggage, spent your mortgage on a portrait
Purple bud look like an orchid, can't afford it? watch me torch it
fuck them record deals
Bitches love me cause my pockets chubby,
And I’m drankin' while I’m driving,
diamond solitaire on panky
They ain't owing, so my money growin, blowin’, rollin’ o and
Drop top beemer, yeah it’s foreign, Ralph Lauren shirt, I’m sippin’ don
leave you stiff just like a mannequin
