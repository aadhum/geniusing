I'm in a rolls Royce in the backseat
Pull up to the club I'm just one D
Cause I'm an OG just like Bun B
CEO Gucci call me Easy fuckin E
Half a pound in my briefs cause I like to chief
I'm a mob guy you think I come from Italy
I got a 458 and its Sicilian
Gucci brought the muscle
I don't tussle with these niggas I'm a hustler
If I stood on all my money
I'd be taller than Lebron
And my top keep dropping back just like the hairline on Lebron
