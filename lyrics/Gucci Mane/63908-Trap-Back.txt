I don't wanna have to push your cap back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
If you ever cross me I'mma get some payback
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back
Flockavelli
Wooh da Kid
He got a nine
I got a Sig
Got hundred bricks, stuffed 'em in the fridge
I'm a drug addict, bitch I gotta have it
I got a gift, I can water whip
I can flip a brick, I can triple up
Need a hundred mill', fuck a record deal
Because a couple millions just not enough
Sell your momma a zip of dust
Serve your daddy a ounce of hard
Got your little sister on the molly
She done went through the whole squad
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back
Making money's my hobby, flipping bricks is my passion
Home girl in the lobby, "Is you suckin' dick?" I'm just asking
I ain't mean to be rude boo, but you know I'm that dude, true
More birds than Atlanta Zoo
If you sendin' them birds across the country, then we probably got the same grind
I'm an OG like my daddy, I'm a hustler like my momma
I'mma stack my bread all winter so I can ball out all summer
Got foreign choppas, Osama
smoke presidential, Obama
Got that bald head, got that skinhead, that white girl Sin√©ad O'Connor
Make em drop dead, I'm in the drop head
On...I'm santa
I need a crown cause I'm standing down, I'm the king of East Atlanta
I don't wanna have to push your cap back
I was gone for a second, but the kid back
Close the curtain on them haters in my Maybach
Put a hole in your motherfuckin' snapback
It's Gucci Mane bitch, so you can say the trap back
