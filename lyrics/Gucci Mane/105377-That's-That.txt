Got dogs on the chains don't let em get loose
All my cars ain't got no roof
And I plead not guilty they ain't got no proof
Look in my closet I ain't got no suits
Two thousand dollar shirt, four thousand dollar boots
Broke ass nigga ain't got no clue
I'm so rich I could buy yo troops
Gucci going broke? You a god damn fool
Whole lotta ice and buncha tattoos
If ya choose me baby than ya know ya cain't lose
Baby got that fat back, and that's that
Pocket got them fat stacks, and that's that
Pull up in a whats that, and that's that
Swag so bad she'll ignore yo ass
Bossed up bitch employ yo ass
Red bottom heels and they match her bag
Real fat ass, do you got a man?
I gotta ask I gotta ask
Hunned yard dash  for the cash I threw
And my car so fast I'll lose yo ass
