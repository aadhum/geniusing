Tell the D.A., give a fuck bout what the judge say
I spent 500 K a week just for the court case
And put a tattoo on my face, so now I'm Scarface
Scarface
I put a hundred on your head if you cross me
Scarface
I want him dead, I don't care what it cost me
Unmarked cars keep on riding up and down the street
Lil G just told me that he's short this week
But how the fuck he gonna be short when I sell work so cheap?
Niggas waiting on me like the mailman coming
First, third, and fifteenth, everybody running
All balls, no brains; niggas know I'm ignorant
Understand and get zeroed when put in that predicament
Niggas call me Scarface cause I gave them a reason to
Got so hot in Atlanta, I had to move to Miami
Going honey baked H.A.M., got my trap house whamming
Just like Revenge of the Nerds, I got a roomful of squares
Got the same gun that killed Bin Laden
