In the Trap house, in the Trap House, in the Trap House
I'm tired of selling bricks I wanna go legit
I wonder can I sell 11 mill like 50 Cent
I'm independent but I'm balling like a major artist
I stay high like giraffe pussy
In My Trap House
Smokin' bubba kushie
And I'm smoking on that purple shit
I heard he got that soft white
In my trap house watchin SportsCenter
In the kitchen cooking but I ain't cooking dinner
Splash it with the water whip it make it harder
17 for 'em the same number as Qunice Carter
Married to the game me and money live together
Street smart niggah never listen to the teacher
You can catch me in the bathroom smoking reefer
Prices low like Wal*Mart
Bricks on I-9 get ya shopping cart
Knee deep in the dope game
I'm not a farmer but I'm known to push them collard greens
