Who me? Ain't’ shit…
Sittin’ court-side at All-Star
And this? Givenchy
My shirt covered in all stars
And y’all wasn’t wearing gold watches
‘Til you seen us wearing gold watches
And you may have a hit bitch
But this one out the ball park
And oh! lawnmower, just for the snake boys
Shoot your ass into pieces, man
And deliver it to your front door
Oh! Encore, they want more, they’re fans now
Don’t approach me with your hands out
Sittin’ down I still stand out
Tall nigga with jewelry on
Like Christmas lights on a damn house
Hit ‘em like “PA!” Hit ‘em like “PA!”
Okay, you know I started from scratch
I got to the strip club just to relax
I get a flat tire, I buy a new car
You know what time it is, check the Rolex
Better choose me, baby, come choose me
If you’re an ugly ho, I can’t leave with ya
If you ain’t a boss then I can’t sip lean with ya
I’m not a rapper, bitch, I’m a mob figure
4-58, it’s a centrepiece
Got a pimp cup, I’m in the strip club
And the difference is these hoes ask for me
Caveman Shit Drag Her By Her Hair Nigga
2 Chainz, nigga, my cuh-cuh
So geeked up couldn’t find the club
Woke up on the beach with a bag of bud (damn)
