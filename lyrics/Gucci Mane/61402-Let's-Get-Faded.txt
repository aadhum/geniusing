Hell yeah, get wasted
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady
She got a pretty little girl
But it ain't my baby
When I see her in the club
The girl drive me crazy
She bounced back like Magic
Pass by like Magic
She see my flying through traffic
It's Gucci Mane, you bastard
And I'm a known shoe-addict
Got em fallin out the attic
I'm a real hood classic
Teamed up with V-Nasty
Came in a V-12
Half a million on the bracelet
Quarter-mil for the anklet
Money flying out the anus
My swag in Uranus
We can have a little fun
But you ain't my lady
I Got Brick Squad With Me, Bring All Of Your Friends
Ask A Bitch Who I Am, Look Who I Came With
Got Jaws Dropping, These Suckas Speechless
Cheerleaders Popping Ass More Hoes In The Bleachers
Baytl The Hottest Product This Year
