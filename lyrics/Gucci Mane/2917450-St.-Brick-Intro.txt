An igloo full of snow and a white stove
Middle of the winter I pull up in a
vert
It's the middle of December she pulled up in a skirt
I'm just trappin' through the snow
Sellin' nine half a bricks in four ways
Over the hills we go
Got an extendo and an AK (gra, gra, gra)
I'm not on no romantic shit
But I'm cookin' cocaine, candle lit
Ran off with a half a zip
All these record labels broke as shit
Ricky Dinky record shit
its Hollis, Queens
stompin' in my shell toes
But I don't fuck with twelve though
I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
I'm tryna come down the chimney with a 100 mil
I'm the Bricksquad boss I'm like Santa Claus
