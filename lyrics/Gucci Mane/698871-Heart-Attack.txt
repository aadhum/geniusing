Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack
I ain't never ever poppin back
I just want me a heart attack
Gotta have my Tinder on her
I don't remember how many times I bone her
And she the bomb like Lotus Flower water
I ain't snitchin' but I told her I really wanna change into a pimp
Turn your little ass at Giuseppe store
All your jewelry on the wrist belt
Told her "baby girl, knock out, knock out" just like Mayweather
She got a good job and her head perfect that's super head
When we first started I'm like Superman now I'm super dead
Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack
I ain't never ever poppin back
I just want me a heart attack
I got them big old diamond chains and thinking about marriage
Heart attack, baby when you roll
You gone give me a heart attack
Don't slow it up baby roll it I want a heart attack
Gotta act just like you know you giving me a heart attack
I ain't never ever poppin back
I just want me a heart attack
