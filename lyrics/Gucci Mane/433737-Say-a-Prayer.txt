And I tote more knots than a Boy Scout got
RIP to Steve McNair, that boy right arm was a rifle
If you ain't made ten mil, I can't call you my rival
I got your baby mama suckin' on me using saliva
I made the Forbes list bitch, man you just a subscriber
My nigga killed his own brother, seen that shit in the bible
Man, Joe Blow chose the fork but you chose the screwdriver
I go so hard I make you dump your whole roster to sign me
And you can find me in the six with all my shooters behind me
[Hook: Rich Homie Quan]
No grey hair, I ain’t stressin’ the case
Leaning so hard on the drank, I forgot what to say
That right too,
And she’ll bug a motherfucker all day, then try to pull up in all grey
Nigga lookin’ nervous, Gerber, soft like baby food
