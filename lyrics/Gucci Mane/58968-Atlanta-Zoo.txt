My phantom was seen on Candler, you ride the transit
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
Drop beam, off set things, color ice cream
White dreams, she can fuck me, that's a pipe dream
X-O, poppin' x-pills so exciting
Cases of Ace of Spade,
The waitress, I made her reload it like the Matrix
On 20, headed to Buckhead, I'm racing baby
But take that fake jewelry off, that shit is fugazi
You think that you're hotter than the kid you're mistaken
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
and a shank that shape like Tennessee (ugh!)
Gorilla goons with the tool down to act a fool
Birds in the living room, it's like Atlanta zoo
Lions, tigers, minks, crocs, and gators for my shoes
Monkey niggas in my hood, I'm living in the zoo
I got lions, tigers, bears in my hood and closet too
