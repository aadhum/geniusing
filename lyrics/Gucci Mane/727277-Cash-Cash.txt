Itâ€™s big GuWop I make your OG's mad
My psychedelics from overseas, and my gas from Sherman Oaks
So tell me what you need, cuz we making that dough
I keep that American cheese, and Mexican pesos
I got a girl from Cambodia, oh international
She don't even have a national, bank account or car
But she be really in them streets, I mean damn she going hard
She won't ever get deported, I might give her a green card
