You ain't no gun toter, pussy you ain't no real soldier
You ain't make your enemy buy black roses
Nigga stop that pump fakin
You ain't shot nobody nigga
Doin all that, we ain't scared of nobody nigga
You ain't hit no licks, you ain't sold no bricks
You ain't did no trappin' nigga (no)
feminine
I'm headed my M&M
You think you was killin' Cam Newton the way that nigga scramblin'
