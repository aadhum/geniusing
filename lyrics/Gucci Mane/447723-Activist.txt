Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
Had my first drank on my birthday
Was a whole pint
Gucci Mane you must be thirsty
Cuz' you can sho' drank
Niggas say the walk rope
Must be an illusion
Gucci got the narc work
That's what the conclusion
I'd rather have a C.N.O.T.E than a Swiss Beat
$50,000 for a C.N.O.T.E beat

Actavis, you are love (Im on that purple drank)
Actavis, you are love (Huh, what, what)
Actavis, you are love (Pour up, turn up)
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
Gucci Mane stay leaning holmes
Double cup my styrofoam
All my niggas drink actavis
With no Qualitest
Gone off promethazine
Every drug from A to Z
[Hook]
Actavis, you are love (Im on that purple drank)
Actavis, you are love (Huh, what, what)
Actavis, you are love (Pour up, turn up)
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
In a straight A
Still sippin' I got it bad baby
I'm on this shit like a crack addict
[Hook]
Actavis, you are love (Im on that purple drank)
Actavis, you are love (Huh, what, what)
Actavis, you are love (Pour up, turn up)
Drank, drank, drank, drank
Lean, lean, lean
Oil, oil, oil, oil
Mud, mud, mud, mud
