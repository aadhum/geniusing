No limit trapper, call me Mr. Serv-On
Talkin' on the cellphone, real real hood
Junkies hit the dope and say it's real real good
And that bitch ain't worth a dime, I got some pennies for that bitch
Spell Guwop in all capital letters cause I'm really rich
Got one baby, 10 baby mamas, Gucci like la vida loco
Silkk the Shocker chopper
Green pinky ring, yea, it look like avacado
Yup, yellow diamond chain, call it Troy Polamalu
Gucci CEO, young Quavo a trap scholar
I got the bricks yesterday, finesse the plug tomorrow
My niggas in 'Rovas, my nigga be remixing Coca
My Mac-90 come with compressor
Got black and white diamonds, Cruella
Junkies at my door, they need that white girl just to feel good
Three amigos, I purchase from
Uno Dos cup my styrofoam
On the same shit Lil Thugger from
Ferrari cars and a Bent' truck
Banging on Slauson Ave, duh
