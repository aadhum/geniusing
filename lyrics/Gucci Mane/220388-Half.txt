Cause I could never give a bitch half
What if I was on my last
You mean she'd get half of my cash
Man that bitch can kiss my ass
I came up, me and Juice I had a half
I cut the head down of 50 dollar slabs
Now I'm trappin hard, I'm on Gresham ave
34 bowls on Herschel Walker
Gucci Mane man, I'm a smooth talker
And I control a bitch like a snake charmer
Gucci Mane not Tiger Woods, I can't even putt
I can give a mutt, half for me, half a, half a what
Man I don't pass no mid to Gucci he gon' break out with a rash
Fat ass, ugly ass, go get that paper bag
