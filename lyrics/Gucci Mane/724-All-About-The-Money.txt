I'm on my way to see my P.O
I ain't talking about probation officer
Talking about my P.O. box, they just sent me 3 million dollars
(What the fuck that mean nigga?)
All my hoes go to the beauty parlor
Bought my ma a house today
I'll buy my auntie one tomorrow
You bring your girl your feelings hurt
Cause like
I got work like babe and them
a Geto Boy like 'Face and them
Hottest boys out Drake and him
Theres no limit to Gucci money just ask Silk the Shock & them
[Hook]
Burglar bars around the door (word)
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
I'm all about that money
Don't make me send my goons to gunning
All about my money, nigga, run with my monopoly
Money; my philosophy
cocaine on my property
Yeah, that bitch a stripper, but there's so much she can offer me
Gave me the connect, he send me 7 and say it's all for me
Money build my confidence
Shorty, show your competence
Before I get another bitch, cause I be on some other shit
Higher than a mothership
Louis in my seven-tre
Gucci in my other shit
Gucci, pass the other clip
Thirty rounds, them I'mma dip
I can make a Hummer flip
I can make a hundred flip-
That's one Bahamas trip
Make your mama strip
I'm bout that dead pres
More check than a check-o-slovin
How you ganna rob the robbers?
These home boys got too much armor
