Tote my pistol anywhere, go to war with a grizzly bear
Burn yo' house with yo' kids in there
Called the folks I had Mid in there
A-K & my Sig in there
drop top V12 cylinder
Your girl never had Christian Louboutins so I bought her a pair
Really it’s not an affair cause she fucked a millionaire
Mack-10, with a coolant fool
Extensions hanging out my britches
You can see this from a distance
I got Bloods and Crips with 30 clips
Don’t no one but yo mama miss ya
Every day I’m on drive nigga, never catch me in neutral
I ain’t doin' nothing in reverse
I wear Louie shoes, nigga, not Converse
I need a strong hook, I call the right person
Yella bone, butt naked
Man all my hoes be actin' like detectives
Say we runnin' out of time
Tell that to a time bomb yeah
I can’t believe this butter, go get my butter knife
Shoot a nigga twice in case he live a double life
the dope dripping wet
I do the shit that rappers do without a rap check
I shit on hoes & pour up foes, I got street respect
I hit you with that carbon, you won’t live a double life
I go Hublos, I got Rollies, I got ice on top of ice
