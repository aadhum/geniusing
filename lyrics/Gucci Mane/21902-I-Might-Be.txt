[Sh] Is you rollin? {*4X*}
East Atlanta slum man is where I come from
The inside of my ride smellin' like a pound of purple
pop a pill disappear like David Blaine
Come back on the track, with Gucci Mane
All through Atlanta my new nickname is Coochie Game
Order Crys by the twelve like a case of Bud Light
I'm high like Fabo
So tell me when to go like my name E-40
Fifty thousand pills man I'm so real
Three dollars for a pill that's a damn good deal
