I know selling dope is wrong but I'm the dope man
One side of beans on my plate, I need some steak man
Got mouths to feed and my nigga's got to eat fam
By any means necessary, we don't give a damn
Put your faith in god and you can be a Trap God
The FEDS they try to label me as a drug czar
Big Guwop the Trap God
But I don't think I'm god
Got a Challenger and a Charger ho
Bitch I'm in love with Dodge
I got body kits on all my cars
They hips like Nicki Minaj
And your girlfriends a masseuse she giving my dick a massage
Multi-Million dollar CEO
Wearing Jordans to his job
Am I a bad man cause I feed my fam with the dope
Call me clearance sale Gucci everything gotta go
