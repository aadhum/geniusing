It's party at my mansion, we got drinks on us
It's a party, bring the gas, we got on us
Got gas, got molly, got lean, got pills, got racks on racks on us
It's party at my mansion, drinks on us
I like the way she dance and you need to come with us
It's 1017 Brick Squad, we got everything on us
On us, on us, on us, on us, on us
It's a party at my mansion, drinks on us
I'm pourin' up promethazine, codeine, I'mma drug addict
Don't fuck with him, might get rained on
Meet the plug in Hong Kong
I'm back and forth like Ping-Pong
Run with the money like Priest Holmes
All ya'll niggas some peons
Your bitch got me on a ringtone
My glasses on, they Tom Ford
My blunt long, extension cord
Got gas got lean and everybody know it
Surrounded by pistols and killas
Sellin' that dope that'll kill ya
It'll have you lookin' like Michael from Thrilla
You still buying bottles of liquor
I'm coppin' that lean by the liter
I'm smoking on reefer
Got cash on me, no Visa
My diamonds wet, Aquafina
Got molly, got gas, got zan
All the jewelry on us
Niggas gon' plot to run up
Not sayin' that I can't get touched
But run up and watch you get bust
