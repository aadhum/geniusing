Now look at me the richest nigga in the room
I was hustling before I came up out the womb
Now look at me the richest nigga in the room
Richest nigga, richest nigga, richest nigga
I'm the richest nigga, richest nigga, richest nigga
I was hustling before I came up out the womb
Look at me, I'm the richest nigga in the room
'89, '96, 2002
I was selling dope before they thought that shit was cool
I was the brokest damn nigga in the school
Remember they was laughing at me pointing at my shoes
22 years old 90 days in jail
This money on my head cause I robbed a
Burned all my bridges time to sink or swim
You's a man or a mouse hammer head or brim
Bitch I'm a hard head cause I'm hard to kill
[Outro]
Iâ€™d rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
