Six rings on, you can call me Robert Horry
Still busting bricks down, Zone Six quarry
Iced-out dog, same size as a Yorkie
White and black chain, same color your Jordans
So Icey boys, we get high like Martians
Nineteen stacks, man
Add two tax, man
Twenty one racks, man
Tats everywhere, baby boo -- I'm sleeving
I think I'm getting the bird flu, damn I'm sneezing
Zaytoven recording
'74 restored, rolling down Moreland
Headed up Custer, I'm finna pick juice up
Still in the Libra doing the same old two-step
