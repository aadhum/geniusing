I know some killas that'll kill you, to kill ya if ya close to me
I did some thangs, that I gotta keep it close to me
I know some killas, and I gotta keep em close to me
If you a snitch, then I dont need you standing close to me
I'm my own shooter, so I keep my pistol close to me
Don`t approach me  nigga like you`re so ho while I be smoking weed
I dont know you nigga, you dont know me nigga so dont come close to me
your my friend and my foe cause you ain't
Close casket, but I'ma shoot ya in yo damn face
I got so much money, that they closed the damn case
