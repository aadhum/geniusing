Zay-T on the track
So Icey E-N-T
See my chain stupid, and my ring stupid
Girl I'm not stupid, but my knot stupid
Offsets stupids, VVS stupids
Girl it's Gucci Gucci, and my diamonds fruity
Seventy on my Jakey baby
color karat bracelet baby
Why not spend about 20 g's, Gucci drop 380 baby
Multi-color clarity, necklaces are heavy mane
Hit the club then leave the club then come back with another chain
Mighty mouse is icey dog, Bart Simpson is just stoopid
Yellow, blue, black, green and white, the diamonds match the groupies
Truly I'm a walkin lick
Gucci man the talkin brick
If you ain't gon' talk no chickens dog, who you talkin to?
7:30 in the kitchen, Nate Nate 'bout to go to school (Nate Nate)
Saturday I'm cookin chickens, momma about to go to work
Sunday Gucci cookin chickens, granny about to go to church
Heavy wrist activity, got me livin lovely
Breakin down ten chickens dog, 'bout to cook the shake up
All these extra grams, might as well go buy a Jacob
Gucci Mane for mayor
I must match our cars and our vests gon' match our gators
You can't swang like Gucci cause you don't got enough flavor
dentistry ridiculous
Bitches I'm magnificent, I'm not very articulate
Every night is Valentine, every day is Christmas
