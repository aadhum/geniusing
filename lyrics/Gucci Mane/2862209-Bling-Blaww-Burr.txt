(Metro Boomin want some more)
And tell your sister I don't love her, I'm in love with her mouth
I'm from East Atlanta Georgia
My mama found some sacks on me, kicked me out of her house
But I had 40,000 saved, I shoulda been moved out
You know Guwop been iced out but I got new jewels now
Think I'm a clone
but if they cut me this sauce gon' ooze out
When real niggas walk in the room then they change the mood
Then I asked that bitch "who run it?"
She said she waiting, I said I'm coming
In Detroit balling like a Piston
