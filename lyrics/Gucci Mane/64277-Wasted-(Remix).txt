Burrr
It's Young Burrr
The State vs. Radric Davis
Rockstar lifestyle might don't make it
Sippin on purple stuff, rollin up stanky
Wake up in the morning 10 o'clock drankin'
Shake it for me baby girl do it butt naked
My alias is Gucci Mane
Radric Davis
See I don't got time to waste, 'less I waste it with the crew
Yo girl drunk, she dropped it low and waste Cris all over my shoes
You hot, but hatin on me
This Wasted Remix with Baby, Wayne and 'Kiss and I cremated it
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Panetela dutchie, wine in my tall glass
Bugatti bat black, where they do that at?
I'm probably with Tammy To (Tammy Torres)
and I'm higher than geranimo
Just performed "We Gon' Make It"
Bitches get naked off the stones in the bracelet
Said you got coke, I brought a fiend along to taste it
Kush got a nigga feelin like he in The Matrix
Hennessey, Patron, Grey Goose, Aces
Tony Montana shit, crib spacious
Cash Money, Young Money fly, in new whips
Lauder jet, G4, high to the sky bitch
no ceilings bitch
