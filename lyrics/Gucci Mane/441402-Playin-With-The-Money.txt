I feel like Eazy with these locs on
I love trap bitches,
this a grown folk song
Put yo hands up if your money real long
Got this strong pack here like Incredible Hulk
If I was going broke nigga I'll rob ya
If I was going broke nigga I'll rob ya
If you need some work fool nigga I'll front ya
If you need some work fool nigga I'll front ya
I'm the East Atlanta jug
Used to get the work and the pills came from Florida
And you my protégé but I can never ride a Mazda
calamari pasta
In the Ferrari California,
sittin on Forgiatos
Got them green and white Air Max 95's cause I just came from Boston
