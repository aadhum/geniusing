Gucci! Gucci
All these diamonds on me, they dancing on me
She glancing like I’m a star
These Giuseppe’s on me, they stepping on me
So I might just stand on the bar
Got this weapon on me don’t help me homie
Put my Bentley to your sentra nigga
Got 3 birds strapped to your pa
And I might be wearing his ??
And if you know what these tear drops mean
Then what the fuck you trying me for?
I done showed this bitch too much too quick
So I can’t cut her off that’s foolishness
She tell on me, it’s over with
But I ain't drinking lean no more I swear I’m through with this shit
I smoke so many blunts of kush I man I’m a fool with this shit
But I ain't smoking that shit no more man I’m through with this shit
Got the Forgiato rims with the F’s on em’
Which one you young niggas wanna get rich?
You say you OG but you talk to the feds
Judas betray me, you gave me this bread
