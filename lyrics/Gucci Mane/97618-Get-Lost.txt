Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord fake niggas he keep
But if I shall die before I wake
I pray to Lord real niggas he take
I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost
Me and my top beefin
So I don’t really wanna see him
They call me Gucci Mane la Flare, nigga
And all the kids wanna be him
I told that girl to get lost
Cuz I don’t even like to argue
But I’m in the Lamborghini
They call me Gucci Debiase
I think I’m fucking Liberace
I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost
And a cutlass so hard
I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost
Top missing, nigga with my new tool
Hella choppers when we choppin nigga
Uptown with the swag nigga
I told my top to get lost
Cuz I don’t really like ceilings
I told a bitch to get lost
I think I hurt the girl feelings
So I hit the gas and get lost
I hit the thrust and get lost
I’m in that new Rolls Royce
If you don’t like it get lost
