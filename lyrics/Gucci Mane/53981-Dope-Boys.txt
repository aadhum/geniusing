All Nas need is one mic,
all I need is one stove
Homie got a nice flow but gucci got that white coke
Last nigga tried me, let's just call him John Doe
And since you short a dime homie then park me a old school
I'm gettin my tip fade cut Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco
Try me like I'm Yung Berg and I'mma make yo eyes cry
Gucci like to drank, and Gucci like to smoke
(Who's that knocking at the door?)
Probably a couple junkies
See my neighborhood is bunkin tell my plug to keep it coming
Dopeboys gone buy you gon' get yourself supply
I'm in my M6 Beemer, this is no 645
Like a pigeon in the sky, I just shitted on your ride
So much weight off in my house, you would think it was a gym
Say I violated probation just because I blew my nose
Blew 300 on my Rolls
200 more on the Lamb
Mirror mirror mirror
Who the realest in the game?
(Why you ask that stupid question
Boy you know that's Gucci Mane)
East Atlanta 6
I just bought another Chevy got it right back out the bowl
It's a four-door black on black Phantom I call that bitch Dorrough
A year ago today, I was sitting in my cell
A so icey billionare
