Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanking
Wake in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!"
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases
Geeking like Whitney, geeking like Britney
Gucci no hippie but he stoned like Jimmy
X-pill poppers, geeked up crazy
Whole clique rolling, everyone's wasted
Purple Codeine Sprite pink: don't waste it
Mix-up, grandma drink it, didn't taste it
Now grandma sipping syrup, leaning wasted
Walking around fucked up twisting her fingers
Homegirl slipped up, drunk, got wasted (Wasted)
Now she backstage and she trying to get famous
See me, I'm a drinkie, drinking, Gucci Mane shake it
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanking
Wake in the morning, 10 o'clock drinking
"Party, party, party!"
I'm so wasted, she's so wasted
Tell the bartender send me 20 more cases
I don't wear tight jeans like the white boys
But I do get wasted like the white boys
Now I'm looking for a bitch to suck this Almond Joy
Say she got to stop sucking cause her jaws sore
Got a bitch on the couch, bitch on the floor
Your partner just popped another one, now he rolling more
Was on 3 pills, now he on 4
I don't know why, but that Remy turn me into a whore
Walked in the club, pocket full of big faces
Got that 40 on my waist and it's off safety
About 40 goons with me and we all wasted
On Remy straight tonight, dogg, no chaser

Big boy bracelets, we "white-boy wasted" (Wasted)
No shirts, fuck it! Our necks and arms are tatted
2-8-5 Eastside
booty/butt chasing
Spring bling, 50 thousand, white girls shaking
Magic City Monday, ball-player wasted
This is for your uncle drinking Thunderbird, wasted
And Gucci's not a racist all my diamonds caucasian
Rock star lifestyle, might don't make it
Sipping on purple stuff, rolling up stanking
