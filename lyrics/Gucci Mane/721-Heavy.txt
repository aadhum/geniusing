Whats up corey
Somebody help me, my neck hurt my chain heavy
flow heavy
Gucci bag full of cash, its so heavy
My ego gettin too big, it's too heavy
My bitch say everytime she look up im bout to do a cook up
I told he if she know like I know she will shut the fuck up
like a mother fuckin' hooker
And I just got out of jail, ya they tried to Michael Vick me
I'm not wit G-Unit but this drum here cost me
My ego gettin' too big, it's too heavy
I keep Miami heat, got more straps then a gun show
Run up on the kid, I have you moarning like alonzo
and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm brisco
I'm I'm in this deuplex in the 6, I only use the kitchen
I got birds like Atlanta zoo
I got money stacks credential,
