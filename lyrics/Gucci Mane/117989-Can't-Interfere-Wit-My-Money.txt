I done robbed niggas, been robbed nigga
I done shot niggas, been shot at nigga
Cause Waka my nigga, I'd die for my nigga
Spent seventy-five on this Rollie'
Tote a .45 like the police
Big Gucci O.G. like Tookie
If you told her why just like Pookie
Since Nino snitched at the end my nigga he cannot be my role model
Like Big Meech, like John Gotti
Got tear drops, but nobody
Blew your brains out your head to make you think about it
I'm cancerous, I'm the dangerous
Like Dunk say, you wanna rob nigga, well me and you probably on the same shit
'Fore I shake your hand, I put a hole in it
Got monkey nuts on my handgun, so my nine hold 'bout two-hundred
Seen a YouTube, 'bout a nigga saying that he gon' do me then run it
But the only thing he gon' do is start running when I start gunning
Let your brother be your pallbearer
shoot you in your head like cousin Harold
Gangster as I wanna be, mobbing to the third degree
Shooting like John Paxson nigga
