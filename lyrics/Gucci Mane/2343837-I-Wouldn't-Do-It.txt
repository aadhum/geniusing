If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it (You know I wouldn't do it)
Cause I'd have been through it (I know I've been through it)
I probably wouldn't even do it (I probably wouldn't do it)
If I had a chance to live my life over
I probably wouldn't do it (damn)
Cause I'd have been through it (for real)
I probably wouldn't even do it
If I had a chance to live my life sober
I probably wouldn't do it
Cause I don't wanna do it
I swear that I'd have been through it
My mama raised one hell of a soldier
I don't see my son like I'm 'posed to
He see me on the TVs and
I tell my mama that I wish we were closer
And if you run up on Wop I'ma smoke ya
c
I'm trying to sell more chickens than
K
My auntie an army girl in the damn service
I throw the pistol like I'm in the damn service
He pulled the pistol out on a man, he got nervous
And he don't really want to do it cause he lack courage
