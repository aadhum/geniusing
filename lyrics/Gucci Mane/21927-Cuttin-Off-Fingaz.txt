Neck piece flooded, it's color scattered and covered
Shrimp scampi odor every time I flaunt chick
Trap nigga conversate, with a Harvard smart bitch
Cartoon jewelry customized by my artist
Big black hollow tips that's what the sig spit
Hataz try me they'll get shot in the kidneys
I'm Gucci Mane, LaFlare, I tote a Glock like a cop do
The port of Miami, to the streets of my 'lanta
My Mississipi niggas feel me harder than Banner
Cause I could give a damn about your father's a pastor
Because I smoke your father then yo' ass is a bastard
Gucci smokin weed, so you know he's a hazard
My money so big it can't fit in my matress
Devil bought the actress cause I signed with Atlantic
The scale in the bag, bitch pay me on the back end
Hamiltons and Washingtons, Franklins and Jacksons
And everything designer from my jeans to my glasses
