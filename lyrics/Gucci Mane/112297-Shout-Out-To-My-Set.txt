Shout out to my set
Shout out to my set
Shout out my connect
Shout out my connect
Shout out my wrist and neck
Shout out my wrist and neck
Shout out to your main bitch, shout out to her neck
It's cold outside ain't got time to play so please don't get wet
Shout out to my weed men, I call them the geek squad
Got two best freaks plus me riding in that two seater
They face to face I'm by myself but they hugging like a wife beater
Shout out to my OG fuck him I'm putting in work
Shout out to them real killers that's putting in that twerk
And shout out to them 26's that's sitting up on my challenger
you an artist, I'm an animal
I eat rappers I'm Hannibal,
I'm a carnivore
I'm a dinosaur, you a herbivore,
I use verbs and words you ain't heard before
Fake trapper never sold birds before, probably never even used dirty words before
But not me,
I'm focused, just watch me,
I send a shout out to my posse
I send a shout out to my AR, my Tech-9 and my AK
I don't play, not ne'er day, not ne'er way, I'm Gucci
Salute me or shoot me
