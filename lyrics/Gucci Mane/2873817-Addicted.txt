When I was on drugs so bad, you know, I talked different
I was drinking lean like crazy everyday, I was out my mind
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Bad bitches, fast cars, weed, and promethazine
Hi my name is Gucci Mane, I'm addicted to everything
Diamond chains, assault rifles, skrip clubs, and gambling
And all the pain I caused my mother, bet she wish she had a daughter
Sheet rock, heroin, crack, and coke
The third week out of rehab he forgetting what they teachin' him
Like why you smokin' blunts and sippin' lean
People in my circle say they care, but they don't really care
Lookin' in the mirror at myself, had to catch my breath
And tell myself that "Gucci, you an addict!" That's the first step
