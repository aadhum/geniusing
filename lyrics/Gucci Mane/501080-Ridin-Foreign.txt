this
And I'm in love with ridin foreign
Take a chance with the man, then I'm squeezin my hand
Brick and a Carbon-15 in the stash
But he still got found with his brains on the dash
You a big bullet, was a fool in the past
Fuck that nigga, I ain't cool with his ass
Two bags of the gas, now the wolves on his ass
Fifty goons on me when I came to the Bash
little shitty glass
Stamps on the bricks, got my own 'caine (GUCCI!)
This Gucci Mane and people say I'm on drugs (true)
