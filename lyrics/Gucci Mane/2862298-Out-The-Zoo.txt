(Listen to this track bitch)
bag
But tell me how you feel when your plug tell on ya
Your partner in crime, own thugs tell on ya
Gotta vest up cause I sholl ain't ducking
My Mexican, Catholic connect doing confession
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
Set it off like Queen Latifah, give me the loot or I'mma shoot
you tuti-fruit
Out the cage in a rage like I escaped out the zoo
Chevelle
