I’m a walking work of art, body marked, yeah it’s marked on
Gave me brain, bless her heart, I taped it on my smartphone
Pink foamposites same color the shit I’m drinking on
Double cup, styrofoam cup, man I’m going on
Geeked up for a while so I rolled a blunt a mile long
Spikes on my feet like they cleats, not an athlete
Christian Louboutins to the wallet, bitch, don’t ask me
I’m a King P, how you mistake me for a car thief
Me, Peewee, Thugga, Young Duke and Chief Keef
T.H.3 through the summer, bitch we off the leash
Two pair of Jordans in my trunk, got that .223
Breast cancer supporter, I pour it up like Hennessy
Got a show in Tennessee and I’ma charge them fifty G
Nigga say he’s headhunting, revolver the remedy
she don’t speak no English
The Bentley on Bleveland, don’t look when you see me
That rarri on Mooreland, keep straight, don’t you look at me
they know I’m a flight risk
Our song is so icy
Make you stick yourself like Tony, nigga
Stick yourself for me, nigga
Monkey nuts on all my guns
So yeah them is my homies nigga
Mob meeting with the clique like Lucky Luciano nigga
Medusa head, Gianni, nigga,
Why they call you Gucci Man and you head to toe Louie, nigga?
Like James Harden, re’d up on mils but I don’t play for Houston, nigga
On the cell with Meechy and he told me I’m the realest nigga
R.I.P. to Fat
shoutout to Webbie and free Boosie nigga
Three mil I got crazy diamonds, mental institution, nigga
Zone 6 14 year old killers, this the revolution, nigga
You hating, what you proving nigga?
