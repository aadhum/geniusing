Walk up in the kitchen, see saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Bricks, they wrapped up in saran wrap
Trapping out the bando with saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
I know what to do with the saran wrap
Saran wrap, saran wrap
Got them bricks and them chickens in saran wrap
Your bitch bad, she in the kitchen, her wrist go crazy
Got a blunt stored with like four grams of cookie
I hit [?] out the lot, now man I’m twisted, twisted
Ganja smoke, I know y’all niggas smell me, smell me
