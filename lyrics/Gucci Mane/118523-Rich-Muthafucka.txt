Bitches say my diamonds be retarded
My little boy worth a mil in kindergarten
You in the VIP but ain't important
You say you want a bottle but can’t afford it
My mama dropped me off on Moreland
If you married to a broke bitch my nigga divorce her
If yo baby daddy broke then your child is a failure
Flash back to 99 now I got some shit to sell ya
Fast foward to 2009, Guwap got something to mail ya
I’m ballin so hard I might buy a pair of Porsches
And she a thick muthafucka
Zone 6, muthafucka
Ice cream, Gucci Mane with the diamond grin
15 chains on, call me Slick Rick
before you got squarin'
I got my main ho buyin more extendos
And shitin' on all my old foes, was my old goal
.44 bull frog, you a tadpole
