Waist deep up shit creek
Tryna' come up but the slope too steep
What you kill what you eat
What you sow what you reap
What you learn what you teach
What you see you repeat
I'm the T-R-A-P-G-O-D
In the A with an FNH on me
Eight hunnid got a nigga whole safe on me
And I'm marching with the bands, FAMU on me
It's a battle of the bands in the VIP
And she say she go to Clark but she dance at Tease
I dare anybody here to put their hands on me
Put the stick up, kids want to kidnap me
Got a Sig on me, are you kidding me?
A little freak lied and tried to put a kid on me
And my own homeboys called the pigs on me
But my faith got stronger and my money grew longer
Sold all my artists now, Gucci Mane a fucking loner
I'm a part-timeâ€‹ rapper, I'm a full time owner
Breaking rules and bending corners, crack your head with a Corona
I got a FNH on side of me
Case my enemies feel they want to ride on me
'Bout to throw up in this club, all this Ace inside of me
Throwing money ain't nothing to me
Haters talking don't worry me, all they do is encourage me
Put my AP and my Rollie on when they bury me
Scared of me, you better be, tell me who ain't heard of me
I just offed another hundred piece, bought a watch for eighty G
