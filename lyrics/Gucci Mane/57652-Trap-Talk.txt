Started out with blood money
50k in drugs on me
around Ill put
Brick Squad runners ten million deep
I'm trying to sell ten billion ki's
AK n AR stay with' me
Mac 99 not far away my dogs don't even play with me
In my apartment 80 a piece
Stack a piece 80 g's
Gucci mane fuck up the sound
Touch my brother, duke, and I'll cock and shoot or cut your throat
55 white bricks fronted to me
23 thou' 5'hunit a piece
.357 sit on top of the seats
Plus a AR-15 ain't far from my reach
Im still in my trap house aka my blow spot
Theres not no one in the game with more swagger than this
Flow hotter than running water
Tattoo'ed up like travis barker
Wrist colder than northern border
Half my goons are thankin' slaughter
Fuck around find you stankin' partner
