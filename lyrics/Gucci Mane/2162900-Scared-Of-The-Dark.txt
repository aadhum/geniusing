I think I'm scared of the dark, so I wear glasses at night
I think I'm scared of the dark, fuck all my hoes in the light
I said I'm scared of the dark that's why my diamonds soo bright
I think I'm scared of the dark, so haters, get out my sight
Fuck her with the lights on,
fuck her with my ice on
Tokyo diamonds
thoin yoin in her loins
Sip goop, hit the joint
Can't wait to guwop out the joint
Mak'
need these M&Ms like I'm from Detroit
two L's above Beelzebub
Right next to the check cashin place
Citgo & the liquor store
Custer Ave, Barrio boys bust yo ass
Coca-Cola Lambo
my speakers Jackie Chain
When Gucci Mane get out, I might sign with Bricksquad 1017
100K just for me to crack a smile
[Outro: Gucci Mane]
I'm a money maker, I'm a heart breaker
I gamble, I'm a risk taker
I'm a dice shaker, I'm a bitch breaker
Got more racks than a pool table
I'm a money maker, I'm a heart breaker
I gamble, I'm a risk taker
I'm a dice shaker, I'm a bitch breaker
Got more racks than a pool table
