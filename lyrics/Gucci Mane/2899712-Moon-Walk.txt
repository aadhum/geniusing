Moon walk
Beat that pussy up so good
Beat that pussy up so good
Gucci Mane's a smooth criminal
Billy Jean is not my lover
But I'm so motherfuckin' hot
I got Elvis Presley's precious daughter
You can be my baby
It don't matter if you're black or yellow
Moon walkin' in Maison Margielas
King of Pop
come rock with me
I beat it, beat it
Takin' all kind of prescription pills
Like Michael Jack, I'm super geekin'
Super freaky, gangster geechie
Like Janet Jackson, scream for me
Like Joe Jackson, I'll slap ya up
I'm dangerous, I'm off the wall
It's Thriller when I'm in the club
Beat that pussy so good
That she use the same ad-libs Michael does (hee-hee)
Beat that pussy up so good
Beat that pussy up so good
Caucasian women, Black women
Spanish, Russian, Asian women (yeah)
Fall out when I touch their hand
They rush the stage like Michael did it
Made more stars than Michael Bivins
White diamonds, Elizabeth Taylor
White folks money crazy paper
Vegas mansion, Cali ranches
Monkeys, tigers, zebras, pandas (damn)
Giraffes and panthers, I'm so handsome
I'm the Wiz and you the Skep
Beat that pussy up so good
Beat that pussy up so good
