It feels so good to be back!
Polow
Usher baby (yeah, Zone 4)
How you doing, Gucci? (yeahhhhh!) (Zone 6)
You a show stopper
Let's get it poppin'
Uh Now she tipsy
Slow dancing in my mansion with no panties
Want to get me
Three girls Gucci trippin
That's a lot of women
I don't want no violence
But damn she trying to kill me
No she is not a prostitute
But if she was I'd have to pay
Gucci ain't eliminate
4 girls with me
Her ass phat as two basketballs
Pretty like Mariah
Finer than Alicia
Sexy just like Trina, dogg
Turn me on like Keri
Cause lil mama is fine as fuck!
