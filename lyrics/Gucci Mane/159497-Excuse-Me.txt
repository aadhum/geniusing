Head 'till I'm nauseous, they keep me exhausted
He do all that lame stuff, I just keep it gangsta
Please pardon me, please pardon me
I'm sorry I'm so spark-a-ly
I don't say this normally but please excuse my ornaments
Excuse me, excuse me
Please let me floss my jewelry
Gucci Mane ain't iced out, ha ha you must be kiddin' me
