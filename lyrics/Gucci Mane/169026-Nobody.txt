There's a trap in every hood and all the j's want that good dope
Gucci got that clean cause all the snorters want that real coke
They say Gucci Mane the god of making music people trap to
Section 8 apartment
I'm in the streets, you out the streets
I'm Hercules, no murkin' me
Gucci back home making music niggas clap to
Its big Gucci, not Bobby V, so ain't no way you jackin' me
You got teardrops on your face with no bodies
Paved the way for making trap music so street niggas should thank me
On G.P. shoot up the BP
One deep on the street with a street sweep?
Gucci Man, I'mma shoot you in your pee pee
Get you fucked in jail like a fefe
Niggas know about Flocka & Gucci
Bullets just fly right by me
You scouts don't get no brownies
One shot just hit my Bentley
Another hit my Charger, but it didn't hurt my hemi
