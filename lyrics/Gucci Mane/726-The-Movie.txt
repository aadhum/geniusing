And I'm so fucking high I need a parachute
"Gucci Mane, do you remember me from last month?"
"Girl, I can't remember nothing but my last blunt"
I got that 3-5-7 so don't try your luck
Bullets have yo body hot you'll need a fire truck
I'm not a boy so I can not be your boyfriend but
If you want me to then I can be your Gucci Mane
And if you're man can't beat it up then I bet Gucci can
Just ask your lady and I bet that she's a Gucci fan
Bought all my hoes Gucci, most all my clothes Gucci
And this is the soundtrack of the Gucci Mane movie
The Gucci Mane movie, the Gucci Mane movie
but that nigga weird
I'm sorry that I cuss you baby girl you're gorgeous
Psych you're not gorgeous but your ass is enormous
And if you never call me I'll be rich regardless
