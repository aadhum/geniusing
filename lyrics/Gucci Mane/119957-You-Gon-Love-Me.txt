[Hook: Verse Simmonds]
We ain’t lookin' at the price tag, fuck that
Baby if you like that, you get that
You gon love me, you gon love me
You gon love me, you gon love me
You see I got enough to get your life right
Money make you come, we gon be fuckin' all night
You gon love me, you gon love me
You gon love me, you gon love me
I can’t lie, I’m into you
Yeah I’m on some other shit
I put you on the money, baby roll with me you never lose
I’ll take you to a island, fly you places you ain’t never flew
Every day’s a business move, your boyfriend tighter than a Jew
When I say you fine as fuck, baby girl I ain’t tryna flatter you
I’m sippin' Absolut
I change your longitude and latitude
Soon as you hit the door they gon Kodak, expensive shit and they know that
