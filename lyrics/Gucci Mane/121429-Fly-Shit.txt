I ain't makin this shit up, ho I ain't Maybeline
I got some shit off in my cup that's gonna make ya lean
Higher than a pilot, fresher than a stylist
Lights frog-eyed'd, the seats cow hide'd
Owe me money and you keep on lyin
I'm a grab my gun, I'm a keep on firin
Goon came in and you took up yo chain
Fuck them niggas I'm a keep on mine
I don't trust that bitch, money make er cum
500$ gun and a million on jewels
