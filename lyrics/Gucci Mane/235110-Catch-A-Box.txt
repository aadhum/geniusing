Pour the lean so dark, it look like Jack Daniels
She’s a supermodel bitch but she got a Nathaniel
I drag a bitch by her hair, captain caveman
15 chains but I’m not a slave, man
Girl you got me real horny but your girlfriend corny
And you can do me how you want, you got a Nicki booty
I spill my lean on her ass she got a sticky butt
You got on 10 Versace chains that’s something Frenchie do
I got on 15 diamond necklace like Big Meech'll do
I murked the man and beat the charges just like Boosie did
Big diamond rings hang off my finger, Liberace kid
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
All I wanna know is
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some dope, ho
I might send some smoke, ho
'do
I might send some pints, ho
Can you catch this box coming off the loading dock, ho
And a rose gold watch with rocks in it
And an all-red Bentley with Glocks in it
If I had one wish, wish for three wrists
2 Rollies on each that’ll make 6
Can you catch a box, ho?
Can you catch a box, ho?
All I wanna know is
Can you catch a box, ho?
I might send some dope, ho
I might send some smoke, ho
'do
I might send some pints, ho
