Yeah! Black migo gang
Bentley mulsanne I treat it like a trap car
WOOOP! WOOOP! god damn that’s a squad car
You're partner pussy made him come up out his 95's
And if I choke on the chicken, oh you’ll all die
Get on these number lines and I’m understanding no line
He doing fifty, he may never see the sun shine
I can’t let you handle me, I can’t let you handle me
All these bitches scandalous, I can’t let you handle me
All my niggas dangerous, I can’t let you handle me
Hotter than a candle be, I can’t let you handle me!
Fake rapper, why the fuck you rap the hood for?
In a mini coop goin 150
I hit the gas, I’m turnt up
