Way, lemon
Way, way, way, way, way
Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Catch me flushin' down the street with the top way back
I had to give these bad bitches somethin' to wave at
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
Keep a rocket in my pocket like my name was Hakeem
Somebody had the picture, she thought it was a dream
A college chick dream big man on campus
All these folks impersonate me like Elvis
I rule with a iron fist wrapped in Velvet
Ridin' in the 'Bach with the seat way back
This white on white Maybach, I call it payback
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
Man y'all know I fuck with Mike Will, we go way back
1017 mob boss, I don't play that
I had a long nosed .38 way way back
I sent a nigga to the pearly gates way-way back
They thought that Gucci Mane was soft now they don't think that
Please get that devilish juice away from me, I don't drink that
My own clothing line Delantic man, yeah I read that
You heard Atlantic dropped Gucci? Why would they do that?
Yeah you know I fuck with Zaytoven, we go way back
I'd rather rap a Zay track than a Dre track
