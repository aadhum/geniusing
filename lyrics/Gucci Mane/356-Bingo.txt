We smoking that fire endo
Wrist out the damn window
Lambo:
scream "Bingo!"
Enzo: they scream "Bingo!"
Phantom: they scream "Bingo!"
Concept: they scream "Bingo!"
Hello, my watch yellow
Earrings on my bezel
Can’t fit in my schedule
'Less booty like Jello
She know I slang kilos
Shout out to my ‘migo
I call, he says "10-4"
Tight like Lamont Rollo
?Lago?
el gato
My house like a brothel
Fat hoes in Chicago
First class tomorrow
Haters wanna hate, they’ll get shot like a free throw
Candy paint wet, dripping off my headlights
Catch me in the trap like some motherfuckin' dead mice
Every time I cut a corner kids screaming "Bingo!
Tools on deck, I ain't talking Home Depot!
Soulja Boy Tell Em
I’m icey as an icicle
So much money, bitch, I valet park my bicycle
Waka Flocka; “Oh Let’s Do It” is the single
Let’s mingle, got hoes like Wingo
Our bitch a dime, yours looking like a cinco
Like a free throw, man I’m balling out
I pull up a T-top Cutlass like "Bingo"
My girlfriend Regal, same color as a flamingo
