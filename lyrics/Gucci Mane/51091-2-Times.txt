hit a fews times
Cause I'm 2 times it's Gucci 2 times
Last night was a blur, least I wore fur
I pulled up in the rear, engine in the rear
Shawty got a pear: apple with a gap
I think we make a pair, she like em from the trap
I got her in the chair think she in da lair
Mr. Get-Her-Dere
With a boss no need for fuckin with a square
Oh I got a joint burnin here real slow
Wanna slide to my crib lets go
I
Show u my double balcony put ur head in my
Lap rite before u start to make out wit me
Crib in L.A I flew her to the south with me
I don't fuck with them haters cause niggas hate but we never speak
Yo bitch want me to save her u betta tame her of get a leash
Mutha-fucker
