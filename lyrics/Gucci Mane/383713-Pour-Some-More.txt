All the vatos in the hood they call me Pablo
Cause I can cook a half a kilo with my eyes closed
I'm in a Lambo' Murcielago
I try to put my dick so deep it touched her tonsils
mixing Sprite in narcotics
Crazy paint on the Bentley it look like Henn' & Hpnotiq
Crack a seal and pour a four up
Kill that cup and pour some more
Cooking dope at Trestle Tree yeah I got the recipe
I done got so famous, I can't even eat at Applebee's
I don't give a damn 'bout no nigga say he out rapping me
50 pints of drank in the trap, I want a stack a piece
Two Ferraris parked at my house, who wanna race with me?
It's Gucci
