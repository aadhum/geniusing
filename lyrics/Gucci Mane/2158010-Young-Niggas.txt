I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Bought a Mac 90 with a fucking beam
Cuz these niggas killing for the letter B
These young niggas killing for the letter C
These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V
I got money, pounds and bullets like my nigga Wee
I know
R.I.P. my nigga Dunk, I see you in my sleep
Remember when I used to sell like 50 bricks a week
I got some shooters and my shooters don't shoot at the knee
If you get caught with all that 3 don't say you copped from me
You wanna take it to the street, we can keep it street
I grab a nigga in the street, they found him on the beach
The richest street nigga living, go call Robin Leach
I scrape ace and them sixes with the Georgia Peach
reverend run
knew that
or be the damn police
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Cuz these niggas killing for the letter B
These young niggas killing for the letter C
These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V
T5DOA, I'm back up on the street
Probably blowing sour cuz ain't nothing sweet
I ain't a body shooter, I'm what you call a "header"
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Cuz these niggas killing for the letter B
These young niggas killing for the letter C
These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V
Young niggas drilling everything they see
Young niggas juuging just to fucking eat
It's a cold, cold world in these fucking streets
It's a lot of young niggas that just love to beef
40 with the drum, nigga, I can't wait to squeeze
When you see the Zoo comin', watch these niggas freeze
Young niggas getting money, money all I see
All I do is hear money, money all I free
It's a smooth 50k in these Robin jeans
I keep a MAC-11 on my fucking seat
Can't let them beat me up like Rodney King
I used to have a dream something like doctor King
Cuz these niggas killing for the letter B
These young niggas killing for the letter C
These young niggas killing for the letter P
These young niggas killing for the letter V
[Outro: DJ Holiday]
