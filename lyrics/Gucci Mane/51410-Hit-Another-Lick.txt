I sell alotta pies
I'm stuntin' like a bitch cuz I hit another lick (yeah)
New face 20's (yeah)
When I started stealing candy I was just 6
My momma's close friends said I'll never be shit
8-7 nigga I was taking kid's shit
Started jacking shawty, let me get that bitch
1989, I was only 9
I wasn't slanging keys I was tuckin for a dime
Mountain Park apartments, everybody on the grind
Sun Valley apartments, everybody got a 9
Had a run in with the law and they put my ass in jail
I always packed a tool
I'm jumping out a Rolls
