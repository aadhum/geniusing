I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
I pull up in that Spyder, strapped up like McGyver
Should have brought my Phantom, na, but I'm mad at my driver
He so fuckin' turned up, ridin' on auto pilot, smokin' kush and smilin'
He drinkin' while he drivin'
I don't think you know me, homie, I suggest you leave me alone
I pull up to the traffic light, icy as a blood light
Shinin' like a flash light, I might damage ya eye sight
I don't want your girlfriend, homie but my bitch might
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
Shops at the Chanel shop, that's how she shop
500 for the flip flops cause they ain't Reebok
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
ain't comin'
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block, boy from the block, block
I'm the boy from the block with the very large knots
