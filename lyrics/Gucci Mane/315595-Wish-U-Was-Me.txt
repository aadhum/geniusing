Its Guwop... Its Guwop...
I got hundred young niggas screaming I don't give a fuck
Got dem pistols in the club, wish a nigga would touch me
Got that .44 on my gut, I don't need no nigga but me
But I'm a multi-millionaire, you wish you motherfucking was me
Nigga wish you was the motherfuckin Gucci Mane
But stop man wit yo wishin' there cause on the real you trippin man
And I know bands can make her dance but I can’t really dance
You spend 100 thousand on it they will really glance
I throw so much money on me, I need hammer pants
And we can bet 1 million, that’s if you’s a gambling man
I talk so disrespectful that I hurt yo feelings damn
Robin Hood of the city, all my niggas struggling
Feel just like eazy when he made eazy does it
Rap niggas name drop, Gucci Mane cocaine drop
Nigga ran off so Imma blow his fuckin’ head off
You can work for me cause now you got a dead boss
