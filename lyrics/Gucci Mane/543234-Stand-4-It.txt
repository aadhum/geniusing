Me and Scooter ball in Vegas, just like Puffy & Mase
I wore my Louboutin's once, and then I throw 'em away
I’m drinkin’ Chandon, Sean John all in the day
This champagne and peach Ciroc, it got me higher than space
They think I got a weight problem I get so much cake
I sixteen so hard it make your heart vibrate
Cause she can't pay the landlord
I bought a Buick Regal, man and I didn't have a license
Used to catch the buster walking just to buy my Nikes
Got 100 young niggas with me all these niggas strapped
