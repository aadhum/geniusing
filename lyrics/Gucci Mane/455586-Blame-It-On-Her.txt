Pick me a bitch and blame it on her
Ok the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that cola bitch
You know I got that soda, I'm gon blane it on her
I say the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that soda
I'm gon blame it on her, I'm gon blame it on her
Bitches just want all my riches
Bitches just want ride on inches
Bitches know I'm a casino
I buy the Indian Remi
My chick is juggin' me fo' they come out
Ballin like sports drinkin â€œLean-a-rade
Pick me a bitch and blame it on her
Ok the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that cola bitch
You know I got that soda, I'm gon blane it on her
I say the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that soda
I'm gon blame it on her, I'm gon blame it on her
Gotta punish in the ill ring and watch
Traphouse been fuck a neighborhood watch
DC to gleeshy
Ain't nuttin' humble for a betta OG
Pick me a bitch and blame it on her
Ok the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that cola bitch
You know I got that soda, I'm gon blane it on her
I say the 12 pull me over bitch, you know I got that soda
I'm gon blame it on her, I'm gon blame it on her
