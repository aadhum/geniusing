What up Juice
I swag through the 6 with my pistol tucked
Brick boy click put your pistols up
And I'm in the 6 screaming "Bricks R' Us"
Gucci Mane the eskimo burr you (burr) bitch (burr)
I drop 100 racks and won't miss the shit (naw)
I'm gangster like Al Capone or James Cady
16 to 22-5, I'm high taxin'
21-5 right now, and I'm happy
Bart Simpson chain so strange it's cartoon dude
