I know my body took a lot of ink
Know I smoke a lot of stink
Bladder piss a lot of pink
My grill got a lot of gold
Gazelles on my fucking frame, waves all in my temp
My mind it be on the prize, hands on with the nine
My traphouse it keep a line, because I'm selling Duncan Hines
My britches be True Religion, in the kitchen cooking chickens
Smoking Swishers, busting Phillies, bought two raris, spent a million
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane
But I'mma put some rocks off in it anyway
Where the Hublot? Cause it accent
My Louis V shades
Old school, still wear Tree Timbs
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane
But I'mma put some rocks off in it anyway
them new LeBron's
Louboutins
This watch right here cost ninety thousand plain jane
But I'mma put some rocks off in it anyway
