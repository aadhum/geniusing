Nothings going to stop my reign ahh ahh
Nothings going to stop my reign ahh ahh
Hurdle my opponents, run through problems
Unstoppable I jump over obstacles
I said it two times nigga, nigga stop lying
Bullshit you selling now I'm just not buying
Standing on point like a unicorn
Strapped with a uni-bomb
Everday's a workday but don't wear uniform
Gucci Mane a dapper don
Trouble like a Capricorn
Trapper month going on a money makin marathon
You the Joker I be Robin
Try not to fuck my money up and rap career like Pacman Jones
Im from east Atlanta 6 where the boys dump bricks
But we don't bump the blueprint 3
Wanna box me just like Max B
But you can't fuck me like Raz-B
Like Ali I'mma float like a butterfly sting like a bee cuz its big Gucci, Gucci
Streets de-railed me
But god didn't fail me
D.A nailed me, watch them jail me
Young don't like me, Jay out-sells me
Nothing in the world Kanye couldn't tell me
You can beat anyone but Gucci
Bet if you had the chance to you'd mute me
Convicted felon my left wrist yelling
Crazy so I need prozac really
This ain't snap music, this is trap music
New boyz in Cali yea they got a jerk movement
Gucci mane I work forks n pots
