Drop, Phantom, camera, Rolls
Ho stick to me just like cologne
Kush is still Guwop cologne
I smell like five pounds of strong
She call my phone I hit decline
And I ain't fine with fuckin' textin'
First of all, I can't trust no woman
So baby leave, all my bitches
Take off like Bessie Coleman
Them niggas leachin', give me back
All my shit you owe me
That trigger squeezin', shootin'
At all these motherfuckers
I hate I love 'em
Oh, me and Guwop straight up East Atlanta with it
