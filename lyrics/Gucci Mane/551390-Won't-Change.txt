Zay, Gucci!
Zay you the greatest
Got that flashback dope I bring your Grandpa back
And when that choppa in my hand, you gon' be the running man
And I count the money faster than a money counter can
You ain't getting shit back once the money change hands (bitch!)
Bricksquad so deep go to war with Iran
Half a mil on the plane but I'm flying air train
I had a knot so big in the lunch line
Here's 500, I ain't beggin you to play shit
I'm proud to say I helped my nigga Waka get a mansion
I wish my nigga Dunk was here I'd help him get a palace
