If I was high as fuck, then he was high as fuck
If I was fly as fuck, then he was fly as fuck
Then you stole something and that was fucked up
Grew up wearing the same jeans, rocking the same shirts
Then we busted guns at each other, this shit hurts
Pulled up in the Phantom, ghost now they say they scared of me
Long live Slim D, Mario, we miss you
Mario, we miss you
