Got a FN with a seatbelt strapped on it cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den, I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond Gems cost an M&M, watch so bright cut off a limb
Look at me then look at him, hard top Bentley Bentley rims
In a drop top dunk I broke the rims
Back to back bitch call them twins, Got a hard top X and a drop top M, call me iceberg slim can’t fuck with him
2k on weed - hell, that’s a bill, 5k on lean, I'm leaning now
Drunk two whole pints, I'm dreaming now
Your girlfriends a semen demon, Big Guwop she screaming out
I'm on Cleveland, call it Believeland
Knocked your bitch didn't need no reason, take my bitch then call it even
