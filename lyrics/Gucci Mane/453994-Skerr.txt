I make Slick Rick proud
Whipping up that Hootie and the Blowfish, I’m getting to it
Chain cost a brick, and a brick all these red rubies
I produce, consume a lot of cash by my fucking self
bring me a melt
You want a pint from me nigga that’s gon cost you two stacks
Thinking bout buying another whip so I took a trip
Got back, told my home boy don’t be surprised when he see me pull up at the block in that vert
