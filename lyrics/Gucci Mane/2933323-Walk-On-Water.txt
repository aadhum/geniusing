made 3 albums in 6 months
I'm so unique, I'm elite
And all day all I dream about is sex
That's why I got on Yeezys
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
I'm the Trap God and I walk on water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Earrings, fingers and they look like water
Neck like water
Wrists like water
Fingers, earrings man they look like water
Like 21 Savage I slaughter them
I'm a human highlight, first take with me
If you got a Dawn, who needs a Wraith?
I'm Ric Flair, I came to take your belt
East Atlanta Santa, you just an elf
