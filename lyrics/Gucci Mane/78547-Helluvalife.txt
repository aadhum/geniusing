Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
I'm smokin' on loud
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
major ice make ya go burr
Money like skyscrapa
Crazy colored karats, baby, cover your eyes
Front headlights and I'm smokin' on loud
You see me from afar, girl, you know who I'm are
so the Juice bunkin'
Young juice man
