I might buy me 50 bricks and just get back in the business
How I was raised you can’t come in, just can't come into the kitchen
Scooter signed with Gucci Mane, that was a better decision
I know Future mad but man, that shit there come with the business
I got so much money on me I can't hold up my britches
I don’t give a nigga one chance to fuck with my riches
And I can’t have no stylist round me, I don’t fuck with no sissies
And if you dissin’ me then diss me and be very specific
I bought a gold medusa belt, just to hold my trues up
And if they give me 50 years, I'm still gone hold my chin up
When I used to sell dope to raise my rent up
