That blouse on you fit just right
Them jeans she got on skin-tight
I'm colder than a Klondike
We know each other, we go together
Like hamburgers and french fries
Hit the club and bring my team in it
Not tonight, I'mma bring my queen in it
Scented oils and candles
I pull up in my Lambo
The weather's real hot, snow on my chest
