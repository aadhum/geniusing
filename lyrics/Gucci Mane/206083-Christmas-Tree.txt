My wrist so rocky, I'm cocky
Cat smell like Issey Miyake
I wanna drag her for jockey
She wanna dig in my pocket
You move a gold digger in
Bitch will live in your wallet
Damn you gorgeous, what you on
She on molly, I'm on chron
Take your bitch that's what we on
Beat her up, RiRi Chris Brown
Diamonds dancin like James Brown
Pitch words like I'm on the mound
Baby know what I be on
I be in and out of time
I put my dick on her tongue
Sell chickens for Patrick Ewing
Calamari
