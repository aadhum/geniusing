Coca, coca, coca cola
yayo bought me everythang
Snorta, storta make an offer; no prob I could cook it for ya
Mi casa su casa partna
guallas
Retail shops and beauty parlors to "cover up these dirty dollars"
White girl with me; Cindy Lauper,
Gave 10 birds to Waka Flocka, told him drop em at Moreland Plaza
Back in the day they said I wouldn’t be shit
Tell them fuck niggas "nigga look at me now
Pull up to the club everybody like "wow!"
Watch cost a car, car cost a house
In the kitchen with Patrick Swayze, me and the yay is dirty dancing
Drop a gold deuce and it white just like some Louie Glass
Gettin ‘em in and gettin’ em gone; definition of a trapper
Barber shops and beauty parlors, just to cover dirty dollars
I’m eyeballin' shorty,
Waka Flocka, Flocka Waka, midgrade bought me everything
They try to retire me like the great Brett Favre
Still in the kitchen, flickin' the wrist
And I’m still on the highway, takin' the risk
Back and forth, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20 with a bunch of them bricks
Ayy, from the 1 and the 6
Ridin' I-20, all white bricks
In East Atlanta Zone 6
I got that cold flu, I got that itchy sneezy
Flyer than a rocket, money in my polly-pocket
