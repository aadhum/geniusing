I wish these faggot-ass cops would let a nigga live
Mrs. Claus on the pole with her panties off
bottles of that Ace Of Spades
A bunch of elves on the team and I've gotta feed them
They carry sawed-off pumps, so it's hard to beat them
I gift wrap a pipe-bomb, bring it to your door
Ring the bell, sit back, and watch the fucker blow
So how you build a snowman with all this melted snow
Santa Claus bringing blocks in from Mexico
They lock me up, and let me out; I feel like Plaxico
I'm in Zone 6, AKA the North Pole
My ears, neck, wrist, fist is real cold
