[Intro: Gucci Mane]
Yeah it’s Gucci, wassup baby
Yellow everything this time
You know what I’m talking about
Yellow rims, yellow big booty, yellow bones
Yellow Lambs, yellow MP's, yellow watch
Yellow charm ring chain, yellow living room set (Chiquita!)
Lemonade Gucci shoes for my girl, it’s Gucci

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
My Phantom sitting on sixes, no twenties in my denim
Your Cutlass motor knocking because it is a lemon
I like them Georgia peaches but you look more like a lemon
These sour apple bitter bitches I'm not fucking with 'em
I'm truly stupid paid, that's just how I feel today
I'm moving slow cause codeine syrup's in my lemonade
I'm standing in the shade and I'm selling lemonade
Six hundred a pint, the going rate off in the A
Lemonade diamond bracelet, put it in your face
Lemonhead diamond earrings I wore yesterday
I'm pimping wearing lemon, that's just how I'm chilling
I'm smoking grits and selling chickens, Corvette painted lemons (Gucci)

[Refrain]
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemons on the chain with the V-cuts
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemonade in shade with my feet up
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemon pepper wings and a freeze cup
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
Lemons in their face, watch 'em freeze up
