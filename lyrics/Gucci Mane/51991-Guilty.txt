Holiday season!
[Hook - Gucci Mane]
If being filthy rich is a crime
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I killed the rap and last night
I pleaded self-defense
I guess I'm guilty bitch
I guess I'm guilty bitch
These suckas talking nonsense
I killed your homeboy
Cause I don't have a conscience
I'm strapped like Bronson
Brick Squad, Trap House, beat bunking
I'm wild like Tarzan
I'm swinging through the Zone 6
In Ferraris.
I go rap for rap, I rep the trap
Came out of jail like
A bat out of hell
I refuse to pay up, gotta salute the myth
Roll the kush in my trial papers
And burn em - I'm not going
Good looking, Gucci got me back
