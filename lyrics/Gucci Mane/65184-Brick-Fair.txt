If you ain't from the Zone 6
Shawty don't go there
I'mma die a bachelor
Girlfriend I don't want none
So don't even go there
Bitch I got a brick fair
Say them boys don't play fair
I'm from the East Atlanta Zone 6
And the kid got rich there
Hell yeah we got bales there
And you know we got bricks there
If the police pull me over
I'll probably get the damn chair
First one off the bench nigga
You can call me the 6 man
Lot of squares in my living room
AKA I'm the brickman
And I hope that you a snitch player
So we can throw you in a ditch player
The way I wrestle with the work nigga
People call me Rick Flair
Pushin weight like I'm doing exercise
Moving up the interstate
And I got them pills and pies
you wanna be if you see me
Just A-1 FBG,
we hit onyx on our PT
Keep water on like FiJi
