Fuck that nigga, look at this nigga wrist
I'm a project nigga with a rich nigga dick
I got a hollywood smile, but I'm from zone 6
I stunt so fuckin' hard I'm on my own dick
Baby think that she the shit because her man play for the Knicks
But my bitch keep turnin' up cause her man pay for the bricks
If she make me cum real quick, I give the bitch a stack
Here's a rack for you, a rack for her, give everyone a rack
I'm a gentleman, a gangster, and a motherfuckin' player
You a square, I'm La Flare, yeah the Multi-Millionaire
All these rappers are my kids so I got children everywhere
She gotta nose for it, she know where the cheese at
But all that attitude you brought you need to leave that
Fuckin' me's a privilege, I don't really need that
I can feed you bitch but I don't need the feedback
I'm leavin' Onyx with two hoes that dance at Magic
