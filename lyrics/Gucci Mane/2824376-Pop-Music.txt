I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible Rari they call me Drop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music
The studio in the house, so we making house music
I'm hearing rumors that my label 'bout to drop Gucci
In my convertible Rari they call me Drop Gucci
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music
The trap God, I make it rain and I make it snow
I feel like Lester Coke
Cause I don't touch the dope
Rappers having conventions on how to stop Gucci
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
They know my Glocks sing my hooks and we call it pop music
We call it pop music, we call it pop music
My choppers sing all my hooks and I call it rock music
