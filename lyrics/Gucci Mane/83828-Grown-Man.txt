Now that I'm finally free
I'm bouta throw it today
I take my life in my hands
Cause I'm a grown-ass man
(I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free
I was lost, but now I'm found
I was blind, but now I see
Life tested me, but God blessin' me
Every 16 bars is a testimony
From the jailhouse junk to the Testarossa
Had to find myself, then remind myself
Fuck up, I'm grown, I got to blame myself
Dead
like ???
Cause I got a hard head like my daddy had
????
and a son to raise
Can't let him make mistakes that his daddy made
???
??? where the cowards at?
Man your homeboy gone where the flowers at
All the money in the world can't bring that back
wish mom and dad could
Lost so much time, can't pay that back
???????????
I take my life in my hands (I take my life in my hands)
Cause I'm a grown-ass man (I'm a grown-ass man)
Now that I'm finally free
I'm a grown-ass man
