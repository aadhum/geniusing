She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, blaww blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
Man the bitch got fresh at the mouth so I iced her
She said something so slick I disliked her
If you ain't getting no cash like this, you can't pipe her
But if you rock a watch like this, it entice her
Man I can't even front on the chick cause she grinding
Necklace full of diamonds, wrist and fist blinding
The type of chick that Guwop like, you can't find
Her closet like Rodeo got all type of designers
That she the baddest bitch in the world, and they want her
But she just a material girl just like Madonna
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
She an icy lil bitch, the bitch is so icy
Burr, burr, burr, burr
But she a sheisty lil bitch, the bitch is so sheisty
Bling-bling, bling-blaww
