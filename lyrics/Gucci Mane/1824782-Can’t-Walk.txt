No lies, she's so bad you take a trip with the bitch
Michael Jackson, chest of diamonds, moonwalk in this shit
I'll take you anywhere you want except take you on a date
Pockets so fat that I can't walk, walk
So geek'd off that she can't talk, talk
Gucci Gucci, that's my motherfuckin dog
BSM, going hard, we be putting on
Wooh Da Kid thuggin like the '94 Pac
