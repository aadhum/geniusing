You get your income tax back, call me
I got dope nigga, you better call me
All tax free
I beat the dope up
Like a step-child
Yeah, the dope's stepped on
Like a step-child
Yellow crocodile with a gold smile
Big bag of collard greens
Like I'm the gardener
Don't try running off on me
Cause I'mma get you back
EA
I got them bricks
You can't tax me, I get it dirt cheap
I know the middleman, but he don't know me
Assult with poolstick
They label me "convict" I don't accept that
