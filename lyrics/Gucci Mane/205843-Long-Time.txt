I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up
Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it, Yeah, this the life I'm livin'
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midget
Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt, pull up
Throwin' money out my ceiling
Young Rich
Nigga, fuck it. Yeah, this the life I'm livin'
Organize the spot
All the babies to the right
All the midgets to the left
Bales of gas to the steps
Get the cola off the shelf
I catch ya slippin'
I pity the fool
I take ya money, I spend it on jewels
Wipe him up, he bleedin', I'm bool
I'm not gay but I spend it on dudes
In a Regal on Bleveland
A whole lotta gangsta bitches and they bleedin'
We teach em to sniff and they find and they keep it
Chanel down, walk up lavish, she know I'm splashin'
Came a long way from them corners, servin that ash
and now I got gwuap
I got 50 bricks, on the plane, comin' from Tijuana
Christian Louboutin , $550 a piece that cost a lot
Pull up at the trap, I boarded my windows
I'm a young rich nigga still
Standin' on stage, blowin' propane
Fuck a Styrofoam, I'ma drink it out the seal
Run up on Takeoff, make a nigga takeoff
If my cup ain't double, its gone be some trouble
Gotta use a wordplay like Ruzzle
Wrist spinnin' like a hurricane
Ice chain came from Johnny Dang
