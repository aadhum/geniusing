It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
I hop up out my bed, got my swag on
Scrambled eggs, filet mignon
two trees blown just for cologne
Money never limited, so icy with benefits
My driver need a passport, all my cars are immigrants
I had a girl, she quit me, now I'm single, wanna get with me?
Sticky cannot stick to me, if you see your chick with Gucci
Think before confrontin' 'ruly, ain't my fault your lady choosin'
4:30, still blowin' purpy
got your girlfriend pickin' purses
Say she lonely, Gucci only one way to meet me in person
When she get me home my nigga told me that she love my verses
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
Your girlfriend keep callin' me, I feel like she stalkin' me
You at home and she with me, so mornin' it's an argument
Drillin' on your sheets
got your blanket at the laundromat
Way baby girl throw it back
old man might catch heart attack
smack it like I'm mad at that
Sweaty sex, so passionate
oral sex, she mastered that
Pornographic poses like she posin' for the Internet
One hour not finished yet, never been a minute man
got her catchin' feelings, man
Used to like her, now I don't, got a real short attention span
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
she got on my favorite thong
Got your main thing screamin' Gucci, every Tuesday night we do it
Wish we could do it more often, but I'm often somewhere flossin'
Aston Martin, double-park it
Beat it like we got a problem
Freakin' partners probably never bother with a second option
Hoppin', got the mattress poppin', rockin' while her girlfriend watchin'
It's four in the mornin' and she callin' my phone
She wanna be grown, we gon' get it on
She said that she lonely 'cause he's never around
Said she like my style, he can lay it down
Say he can lay it down but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up
Say he can lay it down, but I'ma beat it up
I'ma beat it up, I-I-I'ma beat it up, he can lay it down
