My daddy name Gucci, he the Gucci Mane
Honestly he turned me on to the ice game
Guwop
I fell out with my right hand man, he tried to top on me
I guess it's clear we ain't homies like I think we homies
And the bottom of Sun Valley don't do it like the top do it
Bouldercrest we hear AK's more than church music
Hundred PT's in my fridge
