Father status, La Cosa Nostra mentality
Last night I plead insanity, in court screaming profanity
Feel like we the Felix brothers, Mexican Mafia Records
I done let Keyshia see too much, so now it's cheaper to keep her
And I hunt like an hyena play, with racks like Serena
My family tree filled of alcoholics, nigga, gangstas and theives
Wish my grandma was still living, miss my sister Charlese
'Cause she the only one I know kept it realer than me
Wop!
