I know God can't be mad at me
Because all the blessing he gave me!
Riding around with my top down I’m looking up at the galaxy
A lot of girls can’t stand me, They don’t really understand me
Can’t get half of my Phantom, Can’t get half of my mansion
Lost my homie to gunfire, Nigga part of my empire
Ever since that day I’ve been riding late like a vampire
People say I’m a addict, got a lot of bad habits (true)
I love smoking that broccoli, & love stacking that cabbage
Shout out to my jeweler, Damn it’s such a good jeweler
Shout out to my shooter, Damn he’s such a good shooter
Every car that I ride, Clean from bumper to bumper
Every time that I slide, Throw my top in the dumpster
I’m OG, yous a youngster, Got more guns then contra
More chains than Busta
More hoes then Usher
Drumma
So that means more commas
I’m hands on like a laptop, Get your cap popped this summer (Gucci)
Sometimes I, I feel good
I be in the hood, I just ride by
Sometimes I, I feel bad
I be in the hood, Might do a drive-by
Future got it bad, I’m a drug addict
Woke up seen a UFO
Flyest nigga on Earth, Astronaut status
Astronomical I’m phenomenal
Money doing flips, I’m talking summersaults
Feel like I’m on a shroom, All this money in this room
Friday night lights, Chain still swinging
Skulls everywhere
I went to space & left some niggas
I don’t fucking care
I should have went to Yale, The way I move a bail
Death before dishonor, I’ll never tell
