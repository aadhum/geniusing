Molly, kush, I'm leaning screwed
Oxy got me too confused
Freeband Gang, we too confused
Forgiato tennis shoes
Drinking lean and smoking kush
I'm in the kitchen like a cook
Lean and molly, ecstasy
I don't know what I done took
Turn up with puff or fuck with Goose
The Panamera or my coupe
Future plug like everywhere
I swear, I'm geeked up on the soft
