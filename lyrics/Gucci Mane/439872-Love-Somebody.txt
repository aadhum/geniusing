say hell yeah
And I got a crush on you just like first day of school
Every time I bought some shoes, I bought your ass some shoes
Every time I bought some Trues, you got a pair of Trues
And you left me by myself now girl I'm so confused
Tell me why you do the things, do the things, you do
I like the way you walk, when you walk the way you move
Ain't no secret 'bout it baby, that's what made me choose
Oh, and I can't wait to get in the house
Cause I'm gonna eat that pizza on the couch
