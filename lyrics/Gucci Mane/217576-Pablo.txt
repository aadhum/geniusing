[Intro]
Just about anybody who used cocaine
In the 90s and 80s was using Pablo Escobar's product
Escobar was probably the most violent
The most ferocious criminal that has ever lived
Money stacked up like Pablo, peso after peso
You don't want to war with Pablo
They'll kill you when he say so
In Zone 6, I'm Pablo
Diamonds on my neck like Pablo
And the feds on my ass like Pablo
You don't want to war with Pablo
Stop the track!
Salute to El Chapo
21 gun salute
R.I.P. Griselda Blanco
Peso, euro, all about dinero
time to sell this yayo
Guwop
And Iâ€™m kingpin status, so I'm Pablo icy
El Guwop drop trying to outsell Nike
It's silver or lead
yeah, that's my motto
Young Scooter,
my vato
Extendos
cinnamon rolls
Pillsbury big biscuits
7 .62s, and 5 .56s
Telling is prohibited
Turn a blind eye and a deaf ear
You probably want to mind your business
Act like you can't see or hear
Bringing in work in U-Haul trucks
Got more bags than Kris Kringle (Santa)
All up in her panties like a single
Put it down like I'm Mandingo
Serving fiends, smoking out of homemade pipes
My big brother, the dope man
5 straps like Bruh Man
I dress better than I read
Shine gold teeth when I chief
Pick your eyes up when I speak
