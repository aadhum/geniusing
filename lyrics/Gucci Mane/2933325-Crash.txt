I let my pockets do the talkin'
They ain't got nothin' to say
And if you niggas ain't talkin 'bout profit
Then y'all ass in the way
Claimin' blood
Hell naw, boy you know you's a dud
Fiendin' cous'
Hell naw, boy we know you's a scrub
I got insane young niggas and they trained to go
I point my fingers like a cross, and God send 'em to ya door
Man y'all niggas ain't no dealers, man y'all niggas some J's
I don't blame you, I blame yo daddyâ€” It was how you was raised
Should take this Tom Ford belt and beat you with it
Like back in the day
But they stole so much sauce that I heard their record
And thought it was me
200 rounds in my clip, we can blast all night
Lil' bitch
