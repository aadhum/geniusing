But ain't no games getting played in Mountain Park (nope)
That shit get ugly down there like Bubba Sparxxx
I done robbed niggas, I done got robbed
I done sold soft, and I done sold hard
I done got away, and I done got caught
So if I'm crazy, then it ain't my fault
I reminisce about the day I got robbed (got robbed)
Ain't ashamed to say I got robbed
