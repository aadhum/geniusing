Big papa, I got a brand new bag
Fresh out the feds, I got a brand new swag
I don't mean to brag, but let my mink coat drag
In Vegas they treat me like I'm Elvis Presley
She using her eyes to undress the sexy
Who wanna come down and be the next contestant?
The list get the chance to hang in Gucci's section
I walk in the spot like I own the venue
You might find your girlfriend on my private menu
Tie dye shirt on like we at Coachella
I might just jump in the crowd like I'm performing heavy metal
I need you to scream with me 'til it hurt
Bitches chew me up, like the Doublemint twins
Now I'm slidin' down the Crest in a drop top Benz
'Scuse me, I meant in a drop top 'R'
Who needs stylist when you this freezy?
I'm a one man band, but give the drummer some
Mike WiLL, yeah, the Ear Drummers some
I'm a Black Beatle like Rae Srem' and them
