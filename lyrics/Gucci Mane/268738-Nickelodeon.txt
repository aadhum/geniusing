I paid twenty thousand dollars for this beat just to bang in the club
My Batman car made Catgirl stop
This Spider-Man kush is sticky as a spider web
And it's so loud that you can smell it in Fort Lauderdal
Three X-Men fell victim to my 40-cal
Little Smurfs trying to act like they were Gargamel
The AK, nigga, loaded, shorty, REDRUM
It's a bird, it's a plane, no, that's Superman
Girlfriend, please, no, that's just Gucci Mane
I go hard, SpongeBob, nigga, you a lame
Like Garfield, homie, Odie, nigga, I'm a dog
Like Bugs Bunny, big money, got a lot of cash
I shotgun like Elmer Fudd to kill these dirty wabbits
Two chains on, three bracelets, nigga
In my two-seater, nigga
Ah, Pimp C. UGK, bitch!
I smoke purple weed, purple, that's a barney, dog
The Grinch stole Christmas, Gucci just stole 80 pounds
Bright yellow rims, same color my Bart Sim
Shit, everybody's snitching on me, nigga
I don't even keep no phone, nigga
See I'm a junkyard dog, not a Scooby Doo
I got that white girl, true, I'm talking Betty Boop
The way I'm spittin' on the mic it's like I'm Daffy Duck
And I ain't Richie Rich, bitch, but I'm rich as fuck
