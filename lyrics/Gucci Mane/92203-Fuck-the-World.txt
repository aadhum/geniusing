Money owed, dope sold bitch you already know
White birds black birds serving pigeons and crows
I whip the dope so good, a benz jumped out the bowl
Motherfuck the ATF and the border patrol
Me and my amigos at the table shots of Don Julio
I fucked your bitch a week ago, but I ain't gonna fuck her no more (Psych!)
I got the stacks under the mattress so I sleep with the dough
I got them bricks stuffed in the wall so yea I live with the coke
I'm like Pablo in his prime,
shoulder deep with the snow
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I got all eyes on me like Pac did
But I ain't trying to go broke like Joc did
Tell the truth I never thought that I get this big
I think I'm about to buy some choppers like Tip did
I came in, flexing jewelry like Flip did
Got every penny out the 6 I swear I milked it
That Bricksquad shit I built it
I put Flocka in the game and he killed it
I did a song with Lil Wayne and I killed it
My only wish my nigga Dunk was here to rip shit (It's Gucci)
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
I'm in Giuseppe's walking in the rain
That sickle cell hurtin' her bones
I been on some fuck the world shit lately
And I grind to get where I'm at
These niggas don't want to see you with these stacks
