Quiet? No I can't be quiet
80 grand in my Robin jeans
It's hot outside, but I'm coolin it
Mind gone with a foreign chick
With a Tech-9 with a cooling kit
Got the black jeans with the wings on 'em
Gucci shoes, no shoe-strings
Shit, every word means two things
So the white girl is my boo thang
in the drop head at the blue flame
And I don't like to see no new faces
Cause I don't like to learn no new names
I go to sleep in foreign places
Wake up, count big faces
Stuff cash in suitcases, pillowcases
I'm a walking lick, I'm a talking brick, I'm talking shit
Millionaire with Trues on in a stash house with shoes on
Put a million dollars in my new home
And a quarter million in my trap house
Cooking the work with no gloves on
So the junkies can get they grub on
I'm a OG with capital letters
Bust em open, put em back together
Then sell them to you, ahead of schedule
I heard a price tag on my head! (Flocka!)
I'm a walking lick!
Nigga, come and try, you gon end up dead bitch
Me and Gucci Mane, bitch, we hard to kill..
