To wake up in the morning is a motherfuckin' blessin'
Grab my AK I ain't motherfuckin' stressin'
Standing in the kitchen and I'm whippin' up the babies
Only thing on my mind is how to buy me a Mercedes
Scrapin' up the pot, tryna come up with the extra
Young niggas rob and I heard that they finesse ya
Ain't no pressure, get the .38 special
Only thing on my mind is how to put you on a stretcher
I pull up solo dolo in a motherfuckin' Lambo
I made a hundred thousand right on Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Servin' through the _____ with the do' closed
Got more blocks than Dikembe Mutumbo
_____ amaze
I been gettin' money since I motherfuckin' came here
Same shit, cop and go, naw ain't nothin' change here
Know I got that haze, sour, and a couple kushes
Shorty got the rock, and the Glock is in the bushes
One already in the head, hollows in a full clip
