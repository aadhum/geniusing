[Intro Sample: Terrence McKenna]
"...it’s about feeling. The combination of young people, drugs, a fairly sexually charged social environment, and syncopated music is just all designed to draw you into you and your friends and your scene, and your hood, and your place in the cosmos and not sell you out as a consumer to a Hollywood, or Manhattan-manufactured forms of entertainment.”
I'm a real nigga, talking 'bout what I really have
Since the day I lost Dunk, I been really sad
A nigga say he hold you down but will he really blast?
And I ain't content with what I got, got to be really rich
If it's not your girl not really really, then why is it hurting your feelings?
These rap niggas are really scary, talk loud but ain't ready
But meanwhile I'm in my traphouse, with 'bout six different flavors
Cashtank
Got that boy Guwop with me, yup
Nigga I'm bickin' back and I'm boolin'
fix
