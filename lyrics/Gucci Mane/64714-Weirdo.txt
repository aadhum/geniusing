Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Weirdo, weirdo, I'm a weirdo
Mr. Zone 6
Half a million dollar ear lobes
Drumma Boy
Your boyfriend's so last year
Let's have dinner on Uranus
I got Venus on my penis
And Serena wrapped 'round my fingers
Lil' mama wet as Aquafina
I like 'em black
I like 'em yellow
I like 'em red
I like to meet her
And I ain't gotta talk her ear off
The freaks was willing, no need to
That's half a mill each
