I'mma keep dropping verses
Hotter than the hottest summer
Eat rappers like Jeffrey Dahmer
Dope color Sinead O'Connor
Should I name another one
Unless you like President Obama
Wanna buy two extra commas?
Ferragamo
So disrespect my faculty, how dare you have audacity
I spit these rhymes
sporadically
green
drank
pills
blow
I'm the gingerbread man
just keep knockin' on my door
i got white, I got white
kush
Extra loud diamonds and its lookin like a light
Everday diamonds kuz they dont like to hide
Vvs light yea so you block yo eyes
Burnt color diamonds like a sweet potato pie
