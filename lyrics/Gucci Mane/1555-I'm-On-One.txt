I'm on one, I'm on one
Who want one? Who want one?
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
I'm on one, who got them, guys?
Geeked up in the club, baby, we so high!
Got a plasma screen chain like a 60'' movie
No need to fix the flow: it's not broken
"Mama that's the Gucci Mane!
Can he be my step-daddy? Then we'll be icy!"
Shorty got swag, but her swag don't touch me
Underarm kush dogg, don't it smell musty?
Bart Simpson chain, mane, ?
Got a pound of purple kush
It got no seeds
Now I'm tryna bubble kush, now I got no sleep
Geeked up
I got some Skittles in my bag if you want some
If you want one, bitch I'm the X-Man!
My eyes so red, boy I'm so outta here
Is it really me? Or is it fuckin hot in here?
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
I'm on one, girl I can't lie
Whole body roll though
getting brain while I drive
