Get it back, get it back
Bitch, I know I get it back
Give a fuck bout that little paper
Cause I know I get it back
Me and Tit, back to back
Drop-top Lam so low to the ground
Just like a snail, I'm close to the earth
Me and Slim Dunk in the club throwing racks
Go into the trap and I get it right back
Get it back, get it back
Yeah, you know I get it back
Shorty say she want my name
So I bought that bitch a tat
Everything is on the up
Like a elevator
Gucci Mane and Tity Boi
College Park and Decatur
Niggas say they want a mil
I put money on the table
