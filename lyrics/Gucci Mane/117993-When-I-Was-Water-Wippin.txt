You'll have better luck tryna rob a Brinks bank truck
Eight ounces and a Crush soda
Last month I damn near smoked a Range Rover
Secretary sucking politicians
Spending all this money, going out to eat
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
So many chickens in my kitchen got my palms itching
You sucking a rich nigga dick, you in a good position
You say your baby daddy broke? Bitch you really tripping
Yeah I'm a fat nigga, but all I ride is fucking skinny's
Spending all this money, going out to eat
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Baby girl, where you was when I was water wippin'
When I was water wippin', when I was water wippin'
Fuck the bedroom, point me to the kitchen
