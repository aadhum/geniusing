I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm runnin' circles around these niggas
I'm on two-eighty five around these square ass niggas
These niggas monkeys
Need be in a circus
I try to hit a lick with your friend that nigga nervous
I'm a baller and my birthday
It's every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Thursday
I ain't out to impress nobody but my P.O
We watch out for police that be in street clothes
You niggas washed up like some fuckin' clean clothes
Sometimes I feel possesed hope I don't get repo'd
Uzi extra clips skateboard kick flip
Runnin circles around these niggas til they dizzy
Eat that pussy if its pretty
Runnin cirlces around em three sixty Tunechi
You got suspenders on like Steve Urkel
Dont mention your boys
Cause they'll dessert yea
I ball like Kobe
You know I'm shootin'
