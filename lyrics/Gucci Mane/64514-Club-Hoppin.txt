Compound to the velvet, I think I'm Elvis
I always keep green around me like I'm a Celtic
Thirties above the skirties but they ain't scrubbin'
I'm feeling all on her titties, we kissing cousins
Blaze our way to the Libra, back to the Cheetah
You know the procedure when I be smoking reefer
vanished from Club Vanquish
and went to Pin Ups
and went to Strokers
Bad bitches on my tail, we gon' go to mansion
Need a detox I smoking chronic like Dr. Dre
Playhouse im in Los Angeles
In DC I fuck with Love
and i fuck with Stadium
In New York, I'm in Perfections, I think I'm Diddy
Adrianna’s in Chi-Town
know I go to Factory
Pandemonium, i’m in Detroit
