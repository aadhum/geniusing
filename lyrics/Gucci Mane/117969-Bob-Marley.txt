They shot my homie for nothing, killed my homie for nothing
I smoke blunts everyday, to try to wish it didn't happen
But I can't bring him back, cause I am only a mortal
People think I'm a god, but to me I'm only normal
I used to trap on the corner, tracksuit with the thermal
I had that TEC in the bushes, run up on me I burn you
Folks they come to Atlanta, just to ride through my zone
Wanna see where I trapped at, they wanna see what's my home
I got so many pounds in the apartment think I got dreads
I got money in the bed, so I sleep with the bread
If you play with Bricksquad, them might take off your head
I'm so high, fuck nigga I'm so high
I'm so high, baby girl I'm so high
She get high, your baby girl, she get fucked up
And he get high, you know that nigga fuck his nose up
Bigga Rankin
half the niggas he with I don't like
looks just like
FN
what
Say Gucci Mane you a murderer, so you can't get a sponsor like Pepsi
Say Pepsi, fuck you, cause I fuck with the Coca-Cola anyway
On check day it's booming, but it's real slow on rent day
