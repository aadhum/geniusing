They call me Gucci the Don, the best that ever did it
I'm dressed in Louis Vuitton
And if I lift up my arm then it get really chilly
I was worth two mill when I went and bought that Bart Simpson
Hoes think I’m a pimp cause I walk with a limp
No, the pistol on my hip, that’s why I walk with a limp
Come through your block, fuck Pam nigga
