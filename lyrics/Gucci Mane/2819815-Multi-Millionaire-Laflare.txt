I'm smiling like the Joker
Fuck the beef bring me the cheese, ain't no rapper hot as me
Fuck yo plug come shop with me, can't nobody fuck with me
All the lean I serve is clean, bought a new rerock machine
This shit come from Medell√≠n you can step on it again
That boy just a wannabe, Gucci it's just one of me
My shoes never fit your feet, you ain't cut from the same cloth as me
All my friends are millionaires, I hang out with millionaires
Million here, million there, Multi Millionaire La Flare
Colder than a Frigidaire
Call me Gucci got them gasbags, fuck a nigga hashtag
Daddy Fat Sax
Bombs over Baghdad
rappers in a knapsack
Tryna lock the whole trap, damn I miss my old trap
Damn I miss my old trap, damn I miss my old trap
