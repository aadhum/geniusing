Baby, you don't have to treat me all anti
Why you wanna put me on standby?
I can't lie, girl you're hotter than a campfire
We can stay up all night like vampires
Complement each other like burgers and french fries
Baby I think you can bring out Gucci's other side
She said, "How you don't you trust me, you did a homicide?"
Even though the grass so much greener on the other side."
And every man like what he can't have
It's funny but I came back
Baby girl so bad, diss me but I ain't mad
Homie ain't the kid, baby he could never be me
Bet your man don't know you like I know you, so true
Maybe one day babe you gon get your mind right
And if you looking for me you can find me in Atlanta
(Well damn!)
Called me and then she came by and said, "Shit
Yeah you got talent but I'm a bad bitch."
But now when I see her shorty whole swag switched
I walk right by her like she don't exist
Her car broke down and it can't get fixed
Her swag broke down and her bag counterfeit
(Well damn!)
That's not Gucci, baby that's floochy
Remember 2000 you was acting all booshie
9 years later and you're best friend choosing
I scooped her in my phantom and I took her to the movies
Gucci don't gotta act anti
Told her she can have me when she want,that's when she fantasized
Told her I can't talk to her cause I got that man pride
Ever since I left baby girl told me her heart died
