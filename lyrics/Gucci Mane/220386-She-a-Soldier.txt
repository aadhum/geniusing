Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You a soldier, you a soldier
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
15K today, 30K tomorrow, nigga
I live life on boats, like I'm sponsored by nautica, nigga
Zero tolerance for these bitches, they just want chillen
I made a pledge to Migo to take care all my nephews and nieces
Then ran into my Migo then turned to a fucking receiver
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You a soldier, you a soldier
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
After I did that other bid, I thought you would've left me, I was down on my dick
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You a soldier, you a soldier
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
My girlfriend thick, lips look like Crayola
Cocaina, Coca Cola, concealed with that Folgers
I call that bitch lieutenant (....unintelligible...) because that bitch a soldier
Stay down, I'mma put you in a Rover
You a soldier, you a soldier
She a wild alley cat, Villanova
I pray to God, da folks, don't pull her over
It ain't 'bout the sack, it's all about the soldier
I won't care less bout the money but my soldier
I lost a bomb, I lost the pack, I lost my soldier
