Holiday Season, bitch!
That's okay with me, yeah that's okay with me..
Bring that shit back!
White boys, dope boys, ballplayers, peons
Pull up in Europeans
back-to-back like it's a re-run
My pull up game
You pussy niggas disgust me
Smoking on loud and it's musty
Like Hammer: can't touch me
They think I'm BMF cause I designed myself
Like a nigga in a casket I'm fresh to death
Man Tity Boi on that pimp shit!
Like fast food, I eat quick
I'm ready, like master disaster
Eenie Minie Moe, which car could go faster
My trap house I'm king of this castle
It's 2 Chainz and Gucci Mane
Shawty got them crab legs I got that Old Bay with me
And I got that K with me, I wish they would try bitch!
Take you home complete her
Then I skeet her and delete her
Do it with no compassion
Do it without her asking
Yeah I'm from Atlanta
But my jewelry from Alaska!
Forgiatoâ€™s up under me
