Niggas on the inside wishin' for the outside
Peanut butter inside, candy red outside
Hit you with the nine now your inside-outside
Pull up in that foreign that'll leave your bitch mouth wide
Niggas talkin shit, most 'em don't know that I got mob ties
Run up on the 'wop and you're gonna end up hog-tied
Catch me in the kitchen whippin chickens like it's popeye's
I'm a black guy, give me five on the black side
I'm a trap god, leave your numbers by the black guy
He a live-wire, I'ma shut down his wi-fi
'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
You don't want no you don't want no niggas to pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma I'ma pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
You don't want no you don't want no niggas to pull up on you
I'ma call my young niggas and have them pull up on you
Playing with Gucci Mane is just like playing with a lighter
Playing games with Gucci Mane is just like touching fire
Got tattoos on my face my neck my arm but I'm not a
biker
fo' feed the eight
I'm from East Atlanta Georgia man that shit just like The Wire
You say you from Zone 6 but my nigga you know you lyin'
You would think I'm at the grocery store with the collard greens I'm buying
You would kno that i'm the plug cause of all these niggas i'm supplying
