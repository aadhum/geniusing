A to the bay you know
Left the hospital man these crackers be trippin'
If you ain't throw it out the truck why the fuck you plead guilty
Cause I'm the boy that cried wolf so they gone think that I did it
I took them 3 months to the chin then got back to the business
First day out of jail man I bought me a bentley
Me and Keyshia, smoking keisha cuz I’m handsome, she pretty
I got Ka'Oir lipstick all over me but stay out my business
R Kelly 12 Play home making love to a milli
Let’s make a tape, R Kelly-rated, yellow diamonds I'm pissin'
Shout out to 40, water, molly water, 3 different bitches
When you may Sprinkle Me Man, I swear to God I was pimpin'
If you ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
You ain’t sent them cowards to me, then that shit would not happen
Rapping really ain't my passion, I’m really into trapping
I had a sack when I met Big Cat I didn't need no one to pack it
Man the tryna come get me, I feel just like 50
