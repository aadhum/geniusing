George is my father
The Mothership Connection and the rest of the pack
But think back, when Bootsy's Rubber Band hit the stage
With the star-shaped bass, he'd send the crowd into a rage
There's Michael Hampton at one end of the stage
Banging out Maggot Brain with Eddie Hazel
Funkentelechy
No Head, No Backstage Pass
So Free Your dull-ass Mind your funky Ass Will Follow
Standing On the Verge of Gettin It On
Starchild
Everything is On the One
Too Short
But like Ice Cube said, "Once again it's on"
I won't bite though just to write a funky rhyme
I wrote my rhyme in the park, but not Paisley
And if Prince is on my tip it don't phase me
