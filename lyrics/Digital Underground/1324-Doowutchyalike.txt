I see guys and girls dancing

And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
Sometimes I bite
Now if you're hungry, get yourself something to eat
And if you're dirty, then go take a bath
Messed up the line?
Nope, sometimes I don't rhyme
Help yourself to a cracker, with a spread of cheddar cheese
Have a neck bone
Cause everybody's gonna strip, and jump in the pool
Homegirls, for once, forget you got class
See a guy you like: just grab 'im in the biscuits!
Now, red, white, black, tan, yellow, or brown
It really doesn't matter, we can all get down
From a pink-skinned Yankee
Ditch digger
a governor
Like I said, sometimes we bite
Even though you don't think it's right
Yo, I like to bite

And since you came here you gotta show and prove
And do that dance, until it don't move
So Goldfingers, cut what you like
Stetsasonic's not just for the hip-hop fans
Piano Man
play how you like
...Wait a minute, wait a minute, don't take your clothes off yet, not yet --
Wait 'til we get home
Now if you wear corrective shoes and you got big bunions
Toenails smell and look like onions
Don't doowutchyalike--
Go see a foot doctor tonight!
or loud like a bama
some old school
[good times]
Now I can sing, I can dance, I'm the king of romance
Are you sweet young ladies gonna give me a chance
Vanessa Williams, ooh, you're so divine
Just wanted to put your name in my rhyme
