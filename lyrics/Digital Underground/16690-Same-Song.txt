All around the world, same song
All all around the world same song
I came for the party to get naughty, get my rocks on
Eat popcorn, watch you move your body to the pop song
That I'm singing, dinga-linging, funky beats ringing
Everybody's swinging in the place
As I kick the J-A-Z-Z-Y style
R&B mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it won't be long till I'm gone
It's just the same old song
[Humpty Hump]
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin
Sweat dripping, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
Oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezing, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
If it's good and plenty,
There I go, there I go, there I go
But I dont go nowhere without my jim hat
If I'm rapping, cause she's clapping
Then I'm strapping cause I'm smarter than that
Then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
As a matter of fact ill be right back I gotta take a leak
And the bases I touch too much for me tryin to be namin
Clark Gable back in Oakland
Drinkin the same 40's
Hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
Just like butter, my rhymes are legit
Ah shut up and just listen
Not dissin dont get me wrong
But to me its just the same old song
2Pac go ahead and rock this
[2Pac]
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls used to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
Gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
Harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
Same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song
