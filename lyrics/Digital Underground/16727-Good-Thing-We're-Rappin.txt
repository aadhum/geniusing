Alright parents go head tuck the kids in, PG time is over
This goes out to all the macks in the industry..
(You ain't no pimp; You a rest-haven for hoes.)
The royal blue Brougham was a drop top rag
All of this was around spring eighty one
I was in the life and had a good three year run
But the Sunset track got stale, Cookie went to jail
She said, "I'm hot baby, I can't work in this town
The vice pick me up just as soon as you put me down"
shut the hell up ho
Who asked you to run your mouth?
"cop and blow" means you're going up and down
I went from Cadillacs in Vegas to the back of GreyHounds in San Diego
E Street and 5th
Brougham Cadillac
Quarter inch whites
chrome wheel kit on the back
Mack..Mack..Mack..Mack..Mack
sell
the 'P'
Ain't no choosin',
nigga you don't check my bitch like I ain't standin here!
You and her ain't the two, and we ain't the three
And most of all nigga, I ain't the one
to block another man's game is a shame
"leakin' ass nigga,
game recognize game
tool
Shoulda capped his ass
yo, all of this excitement got you dizzy
What you standin' 'round watchin? bitch get busy!
Go back outside and finish gettin' my money!
And yo I go, I go
Doddie-doe-doe, doe-she-doe
Why must I pimp the ho?
Nothing but the mack in me
(..nothin..nothin but the mack in me..)
