Shock G as Humpty Hump
All right! Stop whatcha doin', cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that ya used to
I look funny - but yo I'm making money, see
So yo world I hope you're ready for me
And my sound's laid down by the Underground
I drink up all the Hennessy ya got on ya shelf
So just let me introduce myself
My name is Humpty, pronounced with a "umpty"
oh how I like to hump thee
And all the rappers in the top ten--please allow me to bump thee
and just like Humpty Dumpty
You're gonna fall
I like my oatmeal lumpy
straight gangsta mack
I'll eat up all your crackers
and your licorice
Hey yo fat girl, c'mere--are ya ticklish?
I'm a freak,
I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom
allow me to amaze thee
They say I'm ugly but it just don't faze me
I'm still getting in the girls' pants
And I even got my own dance
The Humpty Dance is your chance to do the hump
Do the Humpty Hump, come on and do the Humpty Hump
People say "Yo, Humpty, you're really funny lookin'"
Ya stare, ya glare, ya constantly try to compare me
But ya can't get near me
Cause in a 69 my humpty nose will tickle ya rear
My nose is big, uh-uh I'm not ashamed
Big like a pickle, I'm still getting paid
I get laid by the ladies, ya know I'm in charge
Both how I'm living and my nose is large
I shoot an arrow like Cupid
looptid
I sang on "Doowutchalike", and if ya missed it
I'm the one who said, "Just grab 'im in the biscuits"
Also told ya that I like to bite
Well, yeah, I guess it's obvious, I also like to write
First I limp to the side like my leg was broken
Shaking and twitching kinda like I was smoking
People say ya look like M.C. Hammer on crack, Humpty
fit
This is my dance, y'all, Humpty Hump's my name
White people, do the Humpty Hump, do the Humpty Hump
I'd like to send a shout out to the whole world
