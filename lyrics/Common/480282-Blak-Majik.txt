[Intro]
Blak Majik (x 32)
Ooh that boy he radical
Talk that money talk emphatical
Who in the game had the baddest hoes
Niggas seen Badu's ass and said "I seen what you was on"
Home grown with no home phone
From the city of wind nigga, win or go home
It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
I don't play away games, I got hitters at home
Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones
Go hard like pyramid stones
Stand the test of time cross the burning sands
With aggressive rhymes, I'm blessed to rhyme
I invest in time
Like Superman, stick out my chest and shine, I'm
[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Blak Majik (x16)
Yeah yeah, I'm black, I'm magical
Keep it one hunnid that's natural
Shout out to black and DC make it capital
I done made enough. I don't have to rap no more
Tell the truth, that ain't what I'm rapping fo'
home of the original gang bangers,
Movie, we are black actors
Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik
What I do, I own like magic
I'm givin' you the gladdest
Night you ever had this
[Break: Jhene Aiko]
Neewteb ni tsixe I ereh ton ma I
Maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma I
I am the matter that cannot be seen
I am the conscious you have in your dream
Do not be scared of my dark energy
I am not here I exist in between
Yeah that's me I'm magical
I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro
I'm nothing you have had before
I'm everything but nothing more
[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
