I got my third eye on the sparrow
Him rocking the Holy Spirit walks through us
A thug is a lost man in disguise
Than any car, any rock or any broad
He found Geto Heaven in himself and God
Love, your happiness don't begin with a man
You never find a man, till you find yourself
Time helps mistakes, you can learn from
Cause one man fucked up men you shouldn't turn from
You want a certain type of guy, gotta reach a certain point too
At the destination, a king will anoint you
Going through the storm, anybody seems warm
That relationship died, for you to be born,
For you to grow he had to go so what you stopping him for?
I hope you didn't use it hoping you could grow to it
Whether serving or a surgeon, you gon' go through it
Can't imagine going through it, without soul music
It's like Donnie Hath' helped me see Lonnie's path
Imhotep
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
Find heaven in this music and God
