Candy sweet, your words of bedtime
I was just saying to myself the other day
Most don't believe in the magician, but you're bewitching
Because of this I must say
I, I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
I, I appreciate what you give to me, yeah
People say I got soul
look at all the records I hold
Through me the black experience is glorious told
so I rock gold
And platinum
Y'all feel most high when I be in y'all
System,
with the rhythm I up jump the boogie
Shame I rely on record labels to push me
Since the bush, I been y'all way to escape
Through eight-tracks, wax, CD's and tapes
I am music
Jay
Dre
I could'a got a mil and ran
But like Sly for the fam still I stand
Inside my heart, it ain't about climbing charts
You know me from lessons or your pop's collection
Whether whole or half stepping, I'm a blessing
