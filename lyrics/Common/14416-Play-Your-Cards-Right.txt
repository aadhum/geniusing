Ohhh...
Everything's gone be alright
If you play your cards right
Everything's gone be alright...
I revolve around the world, a problem solver
Roll dice with niggas who got bricks at a good price
It's the good life, like T.I. said
In the old school Lincoln, thinking I sit low
Remember we were kings, back in the day
Still can be, depending on the cards you play
I ain't playin' with a full deck
The government won't let me get a full check
You tried to smoke my ace
It's high like the ace is
Get your squad face down like cards, before they get a facelift
You get robbed, better yet jacked for diamonds
Leave you nickle-less, like Jack in "Shining"
Took your chips, let my guys in Texas Hold 'Em
Dealt a bad hand, but I played my cards right
