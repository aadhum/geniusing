We take it hiiiiiiiiiiiiigh-er
My little daughter, started, nursery school
Brother Com, gotta make our move through
The mind is a terrible thing to spill
Rap life's like a dream that seems for real
A nigga wake up, superstar, with no acres
After travellin the world to see paper's just paper
Streets take ya back and forth like a shaker
I'm a slave to the rhythm's breakin off
I get the job done, but some days I wanna take off
D be like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
?uestlove said, "We ain't got no time for that!"
My old bird like, "We ain't got no time for that!"
So I rhyme when my back hurts
Play the numbers from my grandmother like Kraftwerk
We're in to win with Hen's and Heineken's
As a, intense MC, sent to be the reign
On the industry I came
With penitentiary talk,
Coke and a Hennesey
My imagery talks, metaphors and similes stalk
Can't explain why the force, is with me
Known to bring a rapper down - like Bobby did Whitney
Sophisticated sissies strut like this is Beat Street in backpacks
Braggin how they don't eat meat and abstract
I backsmack em with they skateboard, flee the crime scene
With a rhyme scheme to escape frauds
Make broads become queens, run things like a rasta sprinter
