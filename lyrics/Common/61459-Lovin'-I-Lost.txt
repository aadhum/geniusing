I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is "gonna get'cha"
But you were 'bout to marry, be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh? Who do it better, we used to move together
Now we not together, is this our new forever?
Hell nah, I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back, had to break down some walls
Issues that I had
Some say it comes from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl, my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up, girl I never gave up
is this our new forever?
