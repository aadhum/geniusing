[Hook: Queen Latifah]
I'm gonna blow your mind, hold you close
Squeeze you tight, the next time that I see you
I'm gonna tell you I love you, cross my heart
And I hope I die
The next time that I see you
I grew up, talking Chi-town slang
Never played soccer but loved to kick game
Like Kobe in the 4th, that's when the game begins
Game begins, games begins
I might Khloe you, marry you in 3 weeks
I thought, like "Man! You don't know me?"
I'm the black guy in the flick with Angelina Jolie
Should of listened to 'Ye, cause she was a gold digger
Love happy, blindsided like Sandra Bullock
