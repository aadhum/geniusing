Some got rich and some got priors
My dogs got barbed wires
and steal cars with pliers
Wanna see more and be more like the wire
Com from the city of Chi
But its never quiet, huh
This is the noise of suppliers, and buyers
Gang bangers that should've retired, food from deep fryers
Bald but these broads is my Delilah
Samsung
Mos spit scriptures
Shorties hold liquor
flows get richer
It gets thick like my bros little sister
Hormones got em thinking quicker
Pure souls that become boa constrictors
Mixed up like elixirs,
Is the fire in your eyes
Cause you're missing all the sights
It's gonna be alright
It's summertime, niggas bring the heat out
Gun talk is how summer start to speak out
Shorties bear arms cause don't nobody reach out
Young frames leak out, aunties freak out
The front porch is sorta like the beach house
Niggas running bases
Every week now I'm getting texts about death
Leaving me out of breath
I gotta step to the stairway to heaven,
it started on 87
Barack was playing sermons riding Reverend Clay Evans
I never really took it in like them youngsters
Cause death and prison sentences ain't how their book should end
You can't stare em straight cause they keep a crooked grin
