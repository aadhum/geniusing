My eyes watch God from a place
Where times is hard,
Everybody want a yard, cause a yard means space
Being broke is odd and leaves an odd taste
In the mouth of the metropolitan
Beautiful minds grind, grind for the dollar and
Whether dice scholarin' or white collarin'
We all taught hustle to profit like Solomon
The young play corners, Sean Jean modelin'
Blue and whites flash lights like parliment
In court non-whites, wishin' they had Cocharan
First to the third, I'm close to the curb
Toast to the bird, now I'm posted to serve
Two weeks, same corner, new freaks
New geese, all white AND 1 new sneaks
Some rhyme, some throw shows, some sew clothes
Some hobo at the junction in between cars
Some enter the functions in between stars
Some teach, some preach saying they seen God
Some put they money up, against mean odds
Flippin' real estate yo, stocks and bonds
Dreams of rollin Eldorados bumpin' El DeBarge
