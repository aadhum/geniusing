Girl, ya been touched by the forces of nature
I'm just trying to motivate ya
Electricity is definitely there
I got shocked when I touched your hair
Girl, ooh, you look "uh"
You're the type of thick that I can't give up
What's your name? I can't hear ya
You could call me "Smokey", I'll be the "Bear"
Whatcha got girl is so unfair
I like the way you move, so keep it right there
Or you can do what you wanna do
I'm just glad I'm in front of you
But I don't mind being behind
Cause I'ma touch you where the sun don't shine
Heard you used to dance at Magic City
The other girls couldn't have been half as pretty
