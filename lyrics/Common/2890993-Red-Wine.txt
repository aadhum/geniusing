Freedom is the road less traveled by the multitude
Where there's food there's vultures
I was sent like a penny in a loafer
The 2Pac Deepak Chopra
When I missed the dap I ain't mean to insult her
Black Caesar, ey o amo roma
Tuto biene vino rosa
Take her to Minetta take her to the MOCA
Most of my friends at home that I'm close to
When they talk, put it on stone like a sculpture
Thoughts I bring to life like an ultra sound
Breaking walls down for the black and brown
A activist is active now
Little homie in the paint tryna post up
Don't make me have to put you on a poster
Posterized by what I vocalize
Yea we wear the mask
They lying on the king like Simba
