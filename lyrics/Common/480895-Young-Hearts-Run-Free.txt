State of the art, state of the drill
State of the mind, state of the city
I contemplate and rewind
State of the art, state of the mind
State of the city
I contemplate and rewind
Kinda arrogant cause I’m from Chi Town
East bound & down, that’s how we get down
At the bar taking shots like they live rounds
My lifestyle is it’s good to be alive now
Came in the Audi, pied piper rowdy
You in the 'Raq where it's war like Saudi
Youngins carry the iron man, like Robert Downey
Pound the ground we own the concrete jungle
Surround me loudly, wildly is how we came up
Yea I like you but I still love her, uh uh uh
Lower the murder rate but still kill this shit
It was written like a haiku when I was seventeen
I used the syllables, y'all, to forever dream
Now I’m a Champagne King like Evelyn
