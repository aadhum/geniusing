Got me peepin' out the blinds like Malcolm with the Uzi
From the 6 to the Chi, got so much in common
Gucci Mane and Common, did you see this comin'?
Nigga with an attitude, a hundred miles and runnin'
All eyes on me, America's most wanted
(Wop)
My North Star's more than a sports car
I paint with words like the brushes of Kehinde Wiley
[Verse 3: Pusha T]
I confess, I've been part of the problem
As of lately, I'm tryin' to solve 'em
I sold dope and I still talk the jargon
Just like Malcolm 'fore the X was on him
All these years later, we still the target
Look at Ferguson, Brooklyn and Charlotte
Sellin' CDs, reachin' for wallets
Trayvon'd be in his last year of college
I still mourn for Christopher Wallace
What happened in Dallas does not give me solace
So I acknowledge my flaws, apolige
