It's like the sun rose to condone it
Strange fruit hanging,
Rock to Coltrane, listen to jazz then, back then
We came with names like James, Fatima
Nina, King, dreamer
Redeemer of the people
Songs for the heaple
Original, spiritual content
You can smell it when it's God-sent
Mississippi goddam, Ferguson goddam
Staten Island goddam, Baltimore goddam
America damn
Yeah we the black sheep but you slaughtering the lamb
Tell em we the stars, they can't shoot us
