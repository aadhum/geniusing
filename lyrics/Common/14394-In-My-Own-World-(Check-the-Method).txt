[Verse One: No I.D]
No time to get all excited, just write it
From the inside let the pen slide, and spread
The ink on the papyrus
Paint the canvas, givin you my vision
Cabrini
Ida B
You want me in your needle
Squirt me in your vein, maintain on the couch
I excite your brain til I'm out of your system
Beat digger, not a nigga or a negro
precede your thoughts
'fore they come into your head (yo kid kinda nice!)
No I.D. from the city with a
beach on thirty-first
Makin all butt crews disperse
"Yeah yeah, now check the method"
[Verse Two: Common]
I say pay attention boy, I say UHH looka here
I want you to see me when you do you look and fear
I dilate pupils that's cornea than a retina
My Book of Life you felt it, because of the texture
When I'm bubbly I call the ex ta, see if she still love me
I'm advanced like a copy studs be on my sac to dub me
CHEAP ASS NIGGAZ! Go and purchase it
I ain't do all this work for shit
My style's my child I gave birth to it
Like an immaculate conception, clean I came
Went through label pains, didn't give shorty a name
I put, bros before hoes that's the way love and life goes
It's a Jungle out there but I'm never Fever-in for them white hoes
I love black thighs, you sisters better realize
The real hair and real eyes get real guys
So before you makeup your face, you better make up your mind
I hope you wake up in time for the revolution, or you gon be like
"I can't believe it! I got shot!"
Bowe/bo so I lick one, not for Riddick
But I got the Rid, for my dick
And the crab MCs that be all over it
Huh, what good is the Rid without the comb?
I'm the street pick peace to Nick, Tim, Mark and Kendall
I remember me and Dion tried to get into Mendel
I didn't have No I.D., they wouldn't let me in
Now them same gumps be askin me to get them in
I be like, "You don't know me... fool"
And color it purple
cause he ain't in my circle
Now I'm talkin square biz to you and I'm out
