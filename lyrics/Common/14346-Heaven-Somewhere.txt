He told me we needed to rap quick
Cause he had did some bad shit
And would be gone for years
Spending these last two days with his momma and his kids
He said now it's time for him to turn himself in
For no longer could he run
From life, from God
I started thinkin, "Why is doin' right is so hard?"
He said, "You know, turn to Matthew 24"
He said, "No one knows the hour, nor do they know the day
But the kingdom is near; don't let anything lead you astray
As long as God is with me, everything will be okay"
Just lying back making the smoke disperse away....
Deep into clouds (deep into clouds)
It's making things appear to me so clearly....
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)
Just lying back making the smoke disperse away...
Deep in the clouds (deep in the clouds)

Heaven? Heaven is being Pops
Heaven is spending a day with the grand children
Listening to their voices and laugh to them play
And then at the end of the day we hug, we kiss, and slowly they walk away
And then suddenly they turn and rush back to me and hug me around the knees
Yeah...thats heaven to me
