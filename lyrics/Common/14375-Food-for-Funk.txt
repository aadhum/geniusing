What, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo yo yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Check it, yo
You say a one for the trouble, two for the time
Come on y'all, let's rock that, uh
[Hook]
I come to grips with mics
I come to grips that a lot of mic users is dikes
I come to grips with the likes of Fred Hampton
When I got light like an intersection
you talk
But you came to my town with protection
I scream "fuck the world" but having a baby girl sorta cock-blocked
Now, to the ladies in the house when you come in the place
It ain't a bunch of niggas all up in your face
The music is thumpin and you're feelin the bass
Lee
I'm in the majors with no rotation
I got my mind made up like Foxy Brown's face
[Hook]
scope the horror
they believe they fly like R. Kelly
[Hook]
