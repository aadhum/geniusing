My name is Common, No I.D
Ferrari Testas, Armani dressers
Told my nigga Ye, I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
It's the pop life, a lot of faces pop up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John, Lennon, I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero, I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye
We take, uh, we make, uh, paper
And build skyscrapers
Walking on water, building my faith up
Niggas with no heart, I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I, feel the pulse of the Chi
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high, so I gotta land them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing, with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common, I'm high above standard
Fly nigga, keep my feet planted
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic
He introduced me, I stepped to the podium
Said peace, gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up, thought about my daughter for a second
The youth, the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records
and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop, you still gotta dream
If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
[Maya Angelou]
Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From all over the world, they came to America
Many shivering in rags, and still they dared to dream
