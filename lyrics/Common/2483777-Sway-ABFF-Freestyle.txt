You know, you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in, our wars and your wars, you put a nigga in Star Wars
Maybe you need two, and then maybe then we'll believe you
We go here, we go here, here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children, they childhood stole from them
The new plantation, mass-incarceration
Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
