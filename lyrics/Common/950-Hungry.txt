[Verse]
I walk the night in rhyming armor, bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope, like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on, them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or intele
I battle stars in stellar
Regions
my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now, it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
In mom's cookouts, I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian, squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material,
Got mag, but my slugs a mic
Auricle air-outs, niggas don't even run for cover right
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man, with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Malcolm X
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you
with power like forwards do
Hip hop, you my bitch and like a Ford, I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool, with them I stay cordial
soft like Tiger Woods
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion,
lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise, you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked
Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
You will on day seven
