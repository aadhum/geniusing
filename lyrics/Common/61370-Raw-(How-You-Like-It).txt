I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad? Hardly, I'm here to party
Wanting y'all to give me body like Lati-fah
Niggas in the corner smoking that ree-fah
Seen a girl she had bottom like a spea-kah
Wanna put some hands on her like a prea-cha
Hmmmm!
She ordered Bacardi, getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
She said "You rap?" Yea mummy
I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money
She was all couture, in a Tom Ford
cause I'm lord
Of finesse, the under,
the rings,
Aware of a chest cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold, I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools, I hoped that he carpooled
long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north she's thick, down south she's fine
a soldier of love like Sade
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the 80s
Uh, uh, uh, uh! You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
"You Hollywood." Nah nigga, I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle
