"It's Common Sense!"
I walked in the crib, got two kids
And my baby mama late
So I had to did, what I had to did
Cause I had to get (duh-ough! duh-ough! duh-ough!)
I'm up all night, getting my money right
Until the blue and white (po po! po po! po po!)
Now the money coming slow, but a least a - know
Slow motion better than (no-oh! no-oh! no-oh!)
About these young brothers, from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it "Jump Off" like Kim and them
Clench my fists tight, holding the right up
