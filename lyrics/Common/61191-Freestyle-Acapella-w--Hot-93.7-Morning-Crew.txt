It's Com Sense, y'all
Come to rock it at Hot 93 point 7
I could go after this, then go to Sportscenter
Go to the campus
you could follow
Me on Twitter
The Dreamer and Believer
Get you open like a wide receiver
They said I should have came to the Jingle Jam
I am that brother that went to FAMU
Never getting stuck, chilling with Nance and Buck
I came to Hartford so I could film Pawn
I got wits for acres like Forest Whitaker
I did a film with Ray Liotta
They seen me earlier at Mo's
Getting a little breakfast
I will ball like the brothers do in Paris
Com Sense got will just like a Ferris
They keep asking me who I'm talking 'bout in "Sweet"
Is it that guy or this guy?
High off the style like Wiz Khalifa
