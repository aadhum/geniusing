Thursday night had plans to be out
Till the night served daylight
But it ain't happen
Cause I'm Common Sense and I rap consciousness
He was prop to dis mad cause my guy used to knock his bitch
As we rolled through the streets of Cottage Grove
I ain't a shooter I just punch a lot
Tried to pop it musta been a Nas cause the gun jammed
Pistol-whipped his ass, his lady's I was palmin' it
Hollered 87 reign dominant
Needed a fight that night
Me and my woman had a argument
"I bang with the big boys, those who hold game"
