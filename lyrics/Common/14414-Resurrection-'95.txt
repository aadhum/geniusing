Yeah I'mma get this one off for Eighty-Seven Street
South side of Chicago, Chicago everywhere check it
Over the global my vocals be travellin'
Unravellin my abdomen it's slime that's babblin
I wish that Madelyne, was back on Video LP
Raps I make up like blacks do excuses
I feel like Noah, hookin' my mellows up on deuces
If a broad ain't got a mind or job or crib she useless
Acoustic basslines embrace rhymes while I chase mines
They say signs of the end is near
I wonder can I walk a righteous path holdin a beer
Got more verses than a Kramer,
go off like a pager
Skills uglier than Craig Mack in your ear I'm the flavor
My old bird said some of my songs sound like noise
Don't watch the Bulls as much, they got too many white boys
A million black men walkin, towards one direction
For sure, the cream of the planets... resurrection
raised among black disciples and Vice Lords
Who don't give a [censored] about mic cords and nice swords
Get up
together black wrists get cuffed
I'm wishin for a change, my man want his change in a cup
Yessir, I'm in the Mix-a-Lot
Bitches put em on the glass
I rule everything around me like cash
On the rocks of reality, dreams get splashed
In jams I mash like Alan Alda
Niggas nod, they say hey as if I was Little Walter
Skull-caps, Smurfs, Puffy jacket, Luggz boots on
Steppin to me is like goin to the County being a Neutron
I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike
Then write something that's skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe
I send light, like Ben's kite I've been bright
Don't hook with skins my friends like
I spend nights up in dykes
I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
Doodoo-Doo-Doo, Doo-Doo, I got it made
I bathe in basslines, rinse in riffs, dry in drums
Had to halt with the, malt liquor
Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
UAC got my back and we don't get no thicker
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga
