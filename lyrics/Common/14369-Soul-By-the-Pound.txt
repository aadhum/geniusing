"Gimme a pound, thank you man" --] Tim Dog
I'm as bad bad, as Leroy Brown Brown
Yo I'm a pro pro, but not a noun noun
If you got beef beef, then you'll get ground ground
Cut up and sold sold, by the pound pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown
I'm the round mound
Not of rebound
Never wore a leash but I get loose
Producin somethin fresher than fruits,
soul
combat boots
So amazin like Luther
everyday Joe but not Bazooka
to see the Man named Chico
save that soft stuff for the Care Bears
if you talk loud, I'll play librarian
Cause see I want it quiet in here
I Mark a Marky and a bunch of funky Uncle Thomases
Play like Christopher Williams cause I gotta keep my promises
To stick to my roots and not dilute cause G this ain't two colors
I'm tired of seein these non rappin dancin motherfuckers
For a record sale a nigga'll sell his soul to go gold
And reach a large scale, sellin for the pale male
I must ask what's goin on with rap, white kids actin black
I'm hearin rap from Antrhax,
I feel like Cypress Hill, I could just kill an A&R
Or whoever's in Charge, it surely ain't Charles
A chick is a chick that's how I treat her
Never go pop I'm not a two liter
Cause U-A-C is family,
