On dollars, it's Michelle Obama, Oprah and Rosa
The mayor of the Chi is Liz Dozier
For your menstrual, it's no more minstral shows
Depictin' women as ignorant simple hoes
Now women get paid as much as men do
Dr. Angelou's lookin' from Heaven's window
Tellin' young girls phenomenal woman is in you
Monuments in Washington of Fanny Lou Hamer
a soldier of truth is marchin' on
No stickin' movers, and no quick shooters
After 15 minutes, callin' you a Uber
And women, they called bitches because they a boss
Now Michelle Alexander wrote the new constitution
Beyonc√© made the music for the revolution
