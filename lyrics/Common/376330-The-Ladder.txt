[Intro]
Littlefinger
The realm, do you know what the realm is?
It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies
A story we agreed to tell each other over and over
'Til we forget that it's a lie
Varys: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie?
Chaos, a gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
Littlefinger: Chaos isn't a pit, chaos is a ladder
The rain came upon us,
we played the corners
Like Richard Sherman the best, I'm still learning
Threats coming from different ages
Change is the only thing guaranteed
In the Seven Kingdoms ain't nobody righteous
A massacre at the Red Wedding, the lifeless
Laid on the ground, now who wears the crown?
We all want it with our eyes on the summit
Chaos is a ladder and some fall from it
high like they all blunted
If this the end let the games begin
[Hook]
I think about it when I'm in my zone
This life is like a game of thrones
I sit and think when I'm in my zone
This life is like a game of thrones
