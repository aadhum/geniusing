Yeah, where my nigga Jay Dee?
Messenger in the Metropolis; apocalypse here and now
Niggas know the ledge, so they don't come near the style
I appear in clouds on some heaven to earth shit
Fake niggas drown the deeper the verse gets
I surface with the purpose
You couldn't fuck with the style if you was a nympho
Raised in the temple of Chi,
taught to look into the eye
Freaky, like Marv Albert
, in outfits, by Chaka Givens
I lecture how I got God but don't got religion
Let's just say you Ramone and I'm Spit
In a habitat of Cadillacs and battle raps
And people that travel at the speed of need
Never agree with the ways of the world
Cats say anything - like they say to they girl
How you bringin it when you sit Indian style?
Niggas know me as Com it's time hear me go wild
Old men see visions young men dream dreams
recognize - I'm the C.R.E.A.M
Com Rules Everything
and everything is
How yo' man pullin yo' weight - he ain't carryin his
Scary the biz is like "The Blair Witch Project"
Experiment in rooms on some bare bitch project
most sell out
- like a dread with a white girl
Everyone I ain't tryin to fuck
Wanna feel female presence and conversation a touch
You'll get split like a date that's dutch
You rap like a nigga that's about to spray
Get a mouth shot, for openin your mouth to say
Feel my heat
you better battle you
I tap into my own zone like it's my home phone
Turn the cell off and let my dome roam
I write fatal bringin niggas to life
