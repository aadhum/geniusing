It's funk to rhythm and punk to rock
Loud like shot that come from a Glock
Monkeys dance around for MTV spots
Rock into a rhythm of street and ancient wisdom
I lay terror in this era like Che Guevera
In a room called real I stay forever
My mind scream like Al Green "Let's Stay Together"
Seen hype become fame against the grain become main-stream
It all seems mundane in the scope of thangs
