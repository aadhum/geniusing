One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two
One wa-wa One, One Two, One Two
One tigga One, One Two, One Two
The same day this thug say, "You gotta come hard!"
It ain't hard to tell
guess it's hard for you hard niggas to start thinkin
Pussy MC's stinkin so I can't get hard
Some, become MC's cause it's hard to get a job
Hard for you to trust people, you don't trust in God
Even harder to be the Gods we created to be
This Western way of life ain't native to me
Put one nigga in your Pulp Fiction and relate it to me?
I hate it that we, the only race that call our women hoes
Niggas, be too hard to say "ho" at the shows
I rose... like a florist to bring the flavor like a Taurus
Niggas you thought was hard, you pourin out your liquor for
Years ago, I thought I was hard, in high school fightin
Now, I'm the hardest man working in show business
Handle your business or shut the fuck up
Forever, I ain't gon' be rappin
This mark asked me do I know his cousin Jimbo
Nigga, I don't even know myself
You want me to get you in
Jack, I'm trying to get through the do' myself
Opportunity knocked, but he ain't call 'fore he came
Next album you gon' blow, up my ass, you done blew it before
GP
So strong am I, A Hundred Styles and Runnin
Niggas stuck on one and them I ran by
Claimin they fly but they stand-by
I come truer than a dream, and youse a damn lie
With that anti-rap, complainin about this and about that
Sounding bitch like, that ain't gonna make a nigga get right
