I don't wanna be a freak, but it's the dog in me
I don't pretend to be the open door roses type
I open the door for myself, and I close it right
And now months laters, I'mma say it ain't my child
I'm sterile girl, we ain't never did nothin
Cause only you and I know that the Common Sense is bluffin
When I was a shorty, I was a lot wilder
But then I got milder,
I'm a dog -- HERE KITTY KITTY
..
Zippidy-doo-dah, a zippidy-zippidy-day
Cause Three is not Company when your other two friends are thicker
And be that I'm a mutt -- so what?
I tell the girls my number 7-7-7-ninety-three-eleven
Then I'm steppin, so when they call me, you'll hear
"Is Common there?" Uh-uh, sorry
You got the wrong number
Choppin down the cherry tree and never comin back
