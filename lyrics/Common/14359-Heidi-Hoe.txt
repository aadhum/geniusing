I'm Petey Wheatstraw
with the heidi heidi ho
do flips like Mary Lou
Just because I fucked you doesn't mean that I'mma marry you
Kill you, ho, cause your shit smells like mildew
Pe-ew, think you need some soap and a rag
Black, Flag
Much disrespect goes out to you
And your parents, too, for having you
Haven't you been introduced to a douche?
I guess you said fuck footloose, and got your pussy loose
I'm tellin Santa Claus you been naughty (sing it)
Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas
Eni-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-meeny-miney-moe
Careful to catch a tiger, after you catch a tiger
You can catch a ho,
I'm Petey Wheatstraw from the Southside of Chicago
I can go the line plus a hundred like Flo Jo
Total recall, yeah I see y'all
Slow up, you forgot your earrings here take em
Salami beef and ham with the asalaam alaikum
Sittin on the dock of the bay, I say ho
But you had a couple of babies I mean a Bunch like Brady
The lady is a tramp
Fuck her sixty-nine you get the eighty-six and don't call me back
There's a party in your mouth BITCH, and everybody's comin
