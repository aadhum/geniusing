Black and blue outside her soul
Carries a heart of gold
Her misconception 'bout what love is, she passes on
Red lipstick bo', French press col'
You know she queen bee by the way she wear her gold
Honey gettin' money the ass is stupid
At the club going hard like liquor
Shots of ciroc she can out drink a nigga
Niggas dig her think they can take her to the crib and break her
She knows time is paper
Glaciers on her neck-uh
Pleasures on her finger
Gucci purse carry notes like a singer uh uh
Go to the steam room and she carry a steamer
Yes sir, never getting gassed like a Tesla
Swag like Angelina or more like Angela Bassett
She fasted for a week that's stronger than most
If she had kids she could mother father them both
Prominent host throw a party and she know everybody
Devil in a tight dress
She know what niggas want she know how to make 'em hunt
She hold her man down when her man get locked up
Prada keep movin' she movin' and shake it like Parkinson's
Eye shadow darker than them dudes she like
An actress her life is so movie like
[Verse 3: Dreezy]
Dreezy
I make it happen I would never need a genie
Went and got zucchini
Threw away that fettuccine
I been going to the gym I'm tryna get in that bikini
I'mma, smart chick but I never went to Harvard
Lookin' for a presidential nigga like Barbara
I'm harder, at these niggas heads like a Barber
This is for my ladies whose single but got a baby
Who Probably driving a Honda but saving for that Mercedes
O'Hare
midway
lake front
Wheeling
