[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2)
With intentions to make it to the league
Intrigued by two-letter cars, SE's and GS'ses
It's sort of foul how the world be reffin' us
For the game of life, full courts ain't preppin' us
Schools want me, but the ghost of Manigault haunts me
Never worked on my left so it's hard to be right
[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2)
Yo, brothers opinions is Bias-ed, like Len
That I'll end up like Ben... Wilsonâ€”still, some pretend to be friends
More so than my soul, my jumper is purer
Me and my moms had static.  Now I reek Hennessy and havoc
Man to man talks with Kenny send me to a zone
But now I stay on point like Rod in this Strickland
[Hook: Sample from Chaka Khan's "Move Me No Mountain"] (x2)
I assemble teams like the Kenny Kings
