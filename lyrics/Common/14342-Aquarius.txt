the life hustlers seek
I seeking it with em,
I'm dope the streets need me to hit em
Revolutionary blunted rap
My peoples want hits, I hit it from the back
Under the cherry moon, I hold notes and carry tunes
on my feet
I'm getting married soon
walking in the clouds like Mary Bethune
Son so many cats, they call me high noon
Offerings to Oshun hoping war is over soon
Guard your grill like George Foreman
Time to build, as far as building I'm the doorman, opening doors
My blood I expose on the floors
tell them the game ain't only the score
To have you tapping your head like Darius Miles
Between churches and liquor stores
With raps, all over your head like Tweet
Playing with yourself, thinking the game is just wealth
Hot for a minute, watch your name just melt
Same spot where it's joyous, where the pain is felt
They say im slept on, now im bucking in dreams
Be grateful like the church psalm my grandmother sings
Im rubbing my rings across the domes of clones
Punchlines like Roy Jones with poems
While you and your dogs foam at the mouth
I take you way out, where you never been before
Been it since birth,
from bitches to earths
From Nat to Truck Turner that lives in my verse
