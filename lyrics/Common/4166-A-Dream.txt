"I Have A Dream" speech
(I have a dream) I got a dream
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
(That one day) We gonna work it out
My dream is to be free
In search of brighter days, I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address, where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list, told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me, no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war, I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
In between lean and the fiends, hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream, I still have one
Images of me, gettin' much clearer
Dear self, I wrote a letter just to better my soul
If I don't express it, then forever I hold
I'm from the side where we out of control
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
My story like yours, yo it gotta be told
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
and Jewish people in cold cage
Hate has no color or age
Flip the page, now my race became freedom
Write dreams in the dark, they far but I can see 'em
I believe in heaven more than hell
In the ghetto, let love prevail
