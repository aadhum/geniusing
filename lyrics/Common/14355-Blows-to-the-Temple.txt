Unamerican Caravan
and now they got courage
Sorta like Goldilocks, tryin to take Pop's porridge
I ain't the Burger King, but I got a whale of blows
I'm stronger, and faster, than Steve Austin
Common'll keep the camera movin -- I'm kinda fast!
I'm from a town called FRESH OFF A NIGGAZ ASS
And I'm about to go on like Stephanie Mills
Cause to the left of me, WE got the U-A-C (whattup)
And comin up to the right of me, WE got the U-A-C (come on)
And in back of me, yo WE got the U-A-C
And in front of me (BAW!) is a dead man G!
He did a dance like Ali (SAY WHAT?)
But he floated like a waterfly and stung like a C
I huff and I puff and I blow (WHAT?)
The motherfuckin house down, I guess you didn't know!
And I'mma steal first, not the base, but your face
You can call me Pencil Petey cause the marks I ERASE
Gamble, but I'm the Proctor
U-A-C in the house
Brother your best bet, is to cover your eyes, like Dee Brown
True indeed a lot of shit, is over he say she say
Me say, Warriors come out and play
And I'mma tear shit up and leave it like the day, after
