I'm as bad, bad as Leroy Brown, Brown
I'm a pro p-pro, but not a noun n-noun
If you got beef, beef, you get ground, ground
Cut up and sold, sold, by the pound for pound
I'm going downtown like Julie Brown,
I'm the round mound
Not of rebound,
got more soul than combat boots
("I got soul, you got it!") That's why I came
give it away, give it away now!
I Got the Power! And I just, I just might Snap
Think fast... cause I'm the Ramadan
Shibidabibidabee, boom boom, I'll be the bad boy
Having a party, but I'm not a Democrat
Spoiled as a child, but now I'm milk like similac
So gimme a T.O. baby like umm, Chris Webber
Rock me tonight, just for old time's sake
Dues is gettin' paid but what about the bills
I wanna make some dough yet I wanna show my skills
I ain't scared of you motherfucker,
I jam like a Cult
I'm not Koresh
Cause I control minds with rhymes
So FBI don't test,
And I'm a scribble all over your faaaace!
I didn't see CB4 cause I heard that shit was wack
Like Chris, I Rock,
I'm strapped like my jock
Peace to No ID and my nigga Ynot!
Whoopee, look at me, I'm hipper than a hippie
Chicks
so ill the MC's say you make me sick
Fatter than Dre, a Lover like Ed,
super as Clark Kent
So gimme the Lane, Lois as I change clothes without a booth
I got more ho, ho ho's than the jolly green giant
Large as the Professor and I'm never faking funk, hock
Fat as heavy metal yet I'm harder than punk rock
I got skills like Tim, and I'm coming in a Hardaway
So keep the crossover,
While you be dragging last, I be kicking like Bruce Leroy
Sho' nuff!
Yo I got the stuff that tops the stove
this was Common with his soul glow
