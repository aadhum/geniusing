[Produced by Dug Infinite]
Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote
Legendary like The Goat, who got game?
My album, niggas was expecting, now my water broke
Before it, I was sort of broke
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still, I'mma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown, I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on, then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm
Don't talk to broads that are spoke for, that provoke war
claim you hard but you ho-core
George Bush and CIA you moving O's for
I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours
[Hook: Dug Infinite]
Com got rhymes, Dug make beats
Sound complete, plus unique, the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real
Chicka-chicka-M chicka-C chicka-M am I
People call me Com and collective
Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
I'm ill,
This crank nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playing yourself, you can't come with it, so you jack off
More heart than an artery
jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony
it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down, this ain't comedy
On every rap hook, sounding like a dog to me
In a reservoir,
On and on, like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
[Hook]
R&B studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
I hate to staple the singers together
But in my head it's been ringing forever
And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
While all you singers booty this and
freak me baby
like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
[Hook x2]
