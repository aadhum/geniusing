For his goodness and for his wonderful works
All praise to the all-eye seeing supreme-being
Giver of joy and peace, love supreme freedom
See him in your sun, see him in the daughters
The mountains, the waters, all divine order
The king unseen, one dream that I had, I was talking to my dad
He said, "Things ain't as bad as they seem"
Is this a God dream the way 'Ye sing it?
The dream seemed to go on as the day lingered
The meaning of life, you can't frame or name it
True stars remain like the name of David
Niggas get foreign cars and think they made it
It ain't yours 'til you create it
My verses go 'til heaven and earth become reversible
Christ particle
Fuck big brother, father, mother, God is watching you
And I want the joy, joy
And I want to know the peace of mind
I'll make a way, a way to see
Through it all and all, living for joy and peace
Still in awe in the night when it hurts
there's a joy in the rain
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
Turn your light on, turn your light on
