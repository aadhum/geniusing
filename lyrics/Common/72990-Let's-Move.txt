It's a beast on the streets, no relaxing up
Trying to figure if it's heat or is it passion for
Do niggas want to eat or are we scavengers?
In the Jeep, two deep, I'm the passenger
Rolling with my guy to pick the package up
His main broad, he kept his stash with her
He trying not to look, she got an ass on her
Got out the truck, blasting BDP
These young bucks wasn't up
They barely heard of me
The nature of the place
Let's move
Yeah, we gotta move
Y'all niggas know we gotta move
Cause we paid dues
It's time to make moves
Talking smack, smelling like crack
