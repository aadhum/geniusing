She rested her head upon my chest
Sensed liberation in between breaths
Wonder if sex is what she found it in
Peace, found it laying down with men
Wasn't there to judge her, many ways I loved her
It was more than bodies we shared with each other
We layed under the cover of friends
A place where many lovers began
I began, to feel her body shake in my hand
Body language, it's so hard trying to understand
Usually after sex, it's a good feel
Took by silence, emotion stood still
I could feel, her tears spill from her grille
Hurt from before that began to build
She told me hold me, a story she assembled it
Tellin' it, trying not to remember it
It was a story of innocence taken
Thought she could redeem, through love makin'
When she was eight she was raped by her father
And tried to escape through multiple sex partners
Felt pitiful, she had only learned
To love through the physical, inside it burned
My heart turned, I thought of what this man did
She forgave him, she grew to understand it
Said it was a blessing and it happened for a reason
By speaking it, she found freedom between me and you
I couldn't concieve her not being here
Death in her face her not having fear
Less than a year she was diagnosed with it
Happiness, would only visit, once in a while
To watch an adult, becoming a child
Somehow, I knew she'd make it
Hurt she placed in, hope and prayer
Hurt she placed in chemo and lost hair
Watchin' Jordan became less important
Seeing this disease eat away my aunt's organs
According to doctors theres no cure
Wish I knew then how to heal with herbs
But the creator was sending for her
What seemed like the end was the beginning for her
Like that, she didn't want us to remember her
No more medication did she want us to give to her
It spread from her liver to her lungs to her last breath
Only to be freed through death between me and you
[Verse 3]
This ain't the way that men feel
A feeling, he said he wish he could kill
A feeling, not even time could heal
Now there was no way for him to ignore it
His parents found out and hated him for it
How could I judge him? Had to accept him if I truly loved him
No longer he said had he hated himself
Through sexuality he liberated himself between me and you
