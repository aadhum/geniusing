Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Plastic bag carryin', no two paces
Passenger side only ride hot bodies
come
I ball, bitches wanna palm me now
Drinkin' lattes, over breakfast I pray and end it with a Ashe
Seats be goin' way back like Just Ice
Black leather wearin' "justice" on the collar
Try to get me, get wet like bed sheets
[?]
Double-0 87, on some Bond shit
I'm out on bond
Fresh out the county, shoes with no laces
Los Padrinos to juvenile placement
Known for C-notes, the feds confiscatin'
Back to that block with brains on the pavement
Paid restitution, O from the lootin' enter
Cause they did it, you was influenced
Your mind gone, life don't seem much bigger
Than your time zone
Blunt burnt lips and a worn out liver
That's everyday livin', guns everywhere chillin'
Got you feelin' like this money comin' sooner than later
'Til then I'll be runnin' from the judge and the bailiff
Crime commitin' cause these women love a man in Mercedes
