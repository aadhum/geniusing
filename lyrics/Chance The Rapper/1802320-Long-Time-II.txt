Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
Money saved me, so I'm a do the same thing
Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time long time now
Since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile
Dropping tapes 'till I losted count
At the crib I'm falling down, I'm on the floor crawling 'round
