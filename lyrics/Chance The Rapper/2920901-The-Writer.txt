I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
