Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham
Dear Father, guide all my brothers away from Sam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
If they ever get caught let's hope they shake that jam
Shake that jam

Chance The Rapper, song singer
Senior bong steamer
Dreamer long beamers
Our neighbors their lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up John Cena
Chancellor Bennett referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences
Is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
Getting hyped up got them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga  got ah ah
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it comes out in a month
Chance the astounding class clown
Turned out to amounting to something
And that’s something 3001, ah
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
Knock knock said the fist to the world, shine sun through the mist and debris
silence from the lips of the free
Say something important
make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry, might sell out in a couple of weeks
Even though last time we spoke, we was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
on God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes,
spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
