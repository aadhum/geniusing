I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I'm coming for your spot
I ain't slept since I graduated
I'm so tired of this school shit
Niggas talking all that glad you made it
I'm getting tired of the bullshit
Posted like facebook walls
Ask me if I care how her face look, naw
Snap back to reality, back pack and a snapple
No back pack in the fall, no plan back for me to fall
It's too risky, it's just a mistake
So crispy, is that a mixtape? Is that an album? Shutup
For your spot, for your top
I'm off of mine
I'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it
I did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford
Can you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?
Next it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston
I do this often, and shouts to Austin the video's awesome
They wanna know more, they wanna know why but he flossing
IDK I eat cake, I still cake, with my bitch
I'm coming for your spot, bitch
I don't give a fuck about you or any of your shit that you...
I'm coming for your spot
