[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Introducin' Chance the Ruthless,
trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid, loosely based on music,
swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce I'll shoot ya (BANG)
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of illusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty, ashy, cigarette ashing, 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended,
last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley,
always in the hallway
So I never been classy,
(Ha ha ha) Shut up
[Hook]
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
Na na na, na na na
(Igh, igh, igh, igh!)
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Acid, Acid, get it? Acid
melts through plastic, I spit fired
Pad my palette, talkin' paper
if this was work, I'd get
higher
Pardon my mishaps, burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped,
like bourbon mixed with jack
Lickety-split, Look it! He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back,
give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit,
batch, fack is you mean bitch?
Zan with that lean bitch, zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra
I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean, hit me back when that mean shit
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Action Bronson]
Introducin', it’s Bronsonlino
With my hair slicked back, I look like Rick Pitino
3 Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow, oh,
I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summit
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer
(Get to the chopper!)
I splash summer like a fast brother, with a number on his back
Ain’t no fumblin', in fact,
I'm back, acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
87 emerald green on a classic jag
She had the cleft palate, I ordered chef’s salad
She had the club foot, with that little arm
I couldn’t help but laugh, she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on
[Outro]
Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens, baby
Blow me
