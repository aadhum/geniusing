Aiyo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? (Yeah yeah)
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
â€˜Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)
