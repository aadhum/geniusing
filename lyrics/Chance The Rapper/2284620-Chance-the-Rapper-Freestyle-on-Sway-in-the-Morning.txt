[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Chance, acid rapper, soccer, hacky sacker
Cocky khaki jacket jacker
Slap-happy faggot slapper
Iraqi rocket launcher
Shake that Laffy Taffy, jolly raunchy rapper
Bang, bang, bang - skeet, skeet, skeet
She do that thing for three retweets
The album feel like '92
Now take that ball 'fore he three-peat
Chance, ho, acid head, cruising on that LSD
Asked Joseph about my deal
He looked back said "hell yeah, let's eat!"
Young Rascal Flatts - Young ass kid ass could rap
Shoutsout the ave
Shouts to all my niggas from Chicago and Laramie
IGH!
[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I'm off the top like a confiscated hat
I ain't looking forward to a magazine
Or a cover of Forbes
Turn up the locks because niggas be trying to rob you
I don't really hear shit they trying to rock through
And alter my shit like control-alt-delete
And i'm hot with the tweets
And i'm hot with the heat
And i'm like the spurs vs the heat
Camp full of soup
[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
You a lame and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets if you read sun times
I be in the sun times if you read one time
I hit it then i hit one time
Every time i drop a hit and niggas like it
Everybody want to rap just like it
i got a trumpet, Donnie
Shoutsout that nigga Nico
I gotta meet those
Girls that be giving me pesos and euros and lethos
You understand it if you write a few papers
Cut it up quickly, Ripley's believe me
I'ma be back on the rap fix
