We want some heroes in our story
We need highlights for a night light
We need glory for a while
Oh, say, can you see America face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
Find us a leader far from Silent Bob's and Cousin Skeeter's
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side
People, people
We the people would like you to know
That wherever you go, we're right by your side
