I don't know what car to drive today (Awman!)
I don't know what shirt to wear today (Awman!)
I don't know what girl I want today
Versace, the Louie, the bally
I don't know what to do so I hit bedloo
What should I wear the Rollie the
Breitling the diamonds they shining my ears
Whip in the Jaguar, hop in the lear
They vote on me like i'm the mayor
Or should I smoke gas and sip medicine
They vote on me like I'm the president
I'm counting on Bedloo to pick out my mamacita for my photoshoot
I'm overdue I'm rocking Versace with chains so how can they notice you
Kicking it old school 20 chains on Mr.T fool
I got the Grinch on christmas (GAS!)
Who stole the pack?(I did it)
My girl, she trippin she irking me she want the Birkin bag color is burgundy
The Gucci pair leathers and Louboutin my footsteps it look like a murder scene
Blood diamonds we call 'em Clifford, water blue diamonds Blue's Clues
