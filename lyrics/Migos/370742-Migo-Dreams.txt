Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
You next to tell put your chirp on
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say, bricks)
In a submarine underwater (splash), you don't know how I'm feeling right now
