Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’ (Don)
My niggas came from nothing (nothing)
You can really smell me ‘fore I’m coming (gas)
Cause Quavo got a whole onion (onion)
Shoot a nigga with a rocket like Lowry
Wipe a nigga’s nose like I use Bounty
Quicker picker upper, you a sucker
Sad to say you niggas drinking ‘Tussin
RIP Mike and Pistol Pete (RIP)
Take a knee, you need to honor me (take a knee)
K I N motherfucking G (king)
Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’ (Don)
I’m on a bar today (bar)
Roll up a Backwood and face that (gas)
Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’ (Don)
Skating on ice but I’m not with the Mighty Ducks (ice)
These niggas drinking on Robitus’
Give ‘em the bubble guts
Ain’t no James Bond, got the golden gun (graow)
Go grab a chicken, plate from Cheetah's
My double cup filled with that bar (Actavis)
Popped a perc and I’m geeked in Aroma (perky)
I got the birds, they sing like the Jonas (brrr)
Feeling like Don Corleone-in’ (Don)
