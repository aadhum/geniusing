You ain't never been on that Island fucking with Gilligan
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
A California foreign baby, something you can barely steer
Wait hold up, that's something you can't afford
Damn, Dolce Gabbana's, Alexander McQueen, she want red bottoms
This bitch she say she want her hair just like Rihanna's
And she know daddy money longer then Rapunzel
But I got one question baby, how the fuck you thinking that you gon' play a player?
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
No she can not play me like a Playstation
Pull up and I drop her off Atlantic Station
And she give me brain that's frontin'
Her phone ring, she hop out my Bentley like her grandmama was calling
I ain't seen her since then, and she still keep calling
They say that you cuffing her, nigga you working for 12
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
I'm a player, bitches calling me Bill Bellamy
Italy, Hawaii, Beverly, it don't even matter to me
The rings, the chains, the bezels, you ain't even on my level
I can help you get your life together, I'm flyer than a feather
We can swap these bitches out nigga and trade them
I put a hole in your nigga, he like a bagel
You not a J-Lo, you a OK ho
Number one rule of the Players Club
Never cuff a bitch that one of your partners done hit
Lil mama foreign, she an immigrant
I can turn you to an American citizen
Courtside Staples watching Lakers
Big mansion, no neighbours
