Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
my trap full of babies
Lil mama she hate me, she say that I'm changing
I tell her I made it, the only thing changing the money I'm making
And the pamper on these babies
These birds they flying from city to city
I'm pouring up Actavis, dranking and sipping
The color is purple, I'm drinking on Ceely
the Benjis
these bitches they sucking like babies
On the nip of them titties,
like VIC get silly
Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
I'm cooking and whipping up pies, with no eyes
I'm cooking them burgers and fries, I'm a master in disguise
Mama she told me I'm wise, looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii,
My bitch, she came from Dubai,
she got that good brain like Devry
the streets is a jungle you gotta survive
Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
