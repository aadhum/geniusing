I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
Now lay me down to sleep, pray the lord my soul to keep
It’s niggas that sin every day, do whatever that go get the cake
Bap Bap Baow, no witness, no forensics
Me and Rel Money, we be balling just like Mike Finley
Kra Kra Kra, banana peeling
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
We flooding your city, Katrina, call FEMA
I’m walking with cash, I don’t carry visa
My bitches are Asian like Tila Tequila
And I keep the seven, I play with the Eagles
My diamonds are Asian, I’m selling Caucasian
I’m smoking like I’m a Jamaican (gas gas gas gas!)
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
I'm white boy wasted so I'm screaming “gnarly”
Why these hoes want to take my soul
Why these girls want to take my soul
