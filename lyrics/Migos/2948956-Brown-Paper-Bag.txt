Go grab the Margielas, right there with the fur (hey)
I am a walkin' lick (lick)
But I am with the shits (I'm with it)
Click, click, click, click, shoot and I sprung my wrist (bla)
Money is bigger than Winfrey's
30,000 to the dentist
We pull up where we got no (bidness)
We fuckin' these stars for fitness
You saying your wrist is rocky, well I got some boulders (Rocky Balboa)
Ice on my neck, cold shoulder (ice)
You talkin' 'bout modern day rap, but don't know the CULTURE
Age of 23, I was in the magazine, the Forbes edition (Forbes)
Brown paper bag (oh)
When you get it make sure you count your racks (racks racks whoo)
Go grab the Margielas, right there with the fur (hey)
Never look back at my past
Sip slow and live fast (Actavis)
I ended up in first place but I swore a nigga started last (I swear)
