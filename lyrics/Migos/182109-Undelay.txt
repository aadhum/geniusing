The bitches they cooking the chicken they whipping it undelay
I'm calling the plug and he bringing it to me like undelay
I'm calling the plug and he wrapping the chicken he ship it away
Undelay, undelay, undelay
Young nigga I did it, I pull up in Bentleys
I'm smoking on something terrific,
then undelay
Ain't worried bout a nigga tryna rob young takeoff F and N on my waist
I cook it and wrap it and flip it and ship it,
I trap in the abandoned building
All black jag
I'm drinking on lean out the seal
Got 32 pack like Shaquille O'Neal
Got cameras outside of my crib
He said my bad, sent me a new pack and bought me a brand new duelly
