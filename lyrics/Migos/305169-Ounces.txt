Metro!
Bando used to smell like some stinkin' enchiladas (bando)
The streets is a jungle, got to watch for the koalas (snoopers)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Whole lot of ounces! (whole lot)
Ounces, ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
I’m selling that kush to Asher,
Rel Money,
Money taller than mountains,
She so bad gave me erection or eroused, whatever you call it
10 of em' saying "go get to the guap", other 6 saying "Migos up next"

Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it

Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
My neck is so sick, got the measles
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
You niggas fugazy, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
