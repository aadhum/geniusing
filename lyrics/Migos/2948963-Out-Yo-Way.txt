Cancel all your plans, you will understand
All this pain, we can live through it, it's called success
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah
You always going out your way
You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh

Just to pass the test, I won't act the best
I got Actavis, there's nothing I can't ask the bitch, no
Not one missed call, no missed calls, hell nah, nah
She got a man, can't get involved, no, nah, nah
I put this weight on like I put a cape on
Mama told me stay strong, grandma told me stay on
Now she looking down, throwin' blessings
Head full of hair, but the cat well groomed
Never switch your act, brand new
You always going out your way

Everybody said that we would fall away
Nobody thought that we would go up
But we blew up, blew up, blew up
You always going out your way
You always dropping off your flav, yeah

You never ask me to repay, no
You always going out your way, yeah, yeah, ooh
You always going out your way, yeah, ooh
