Whats that in your cup? Man that's that dirty shit. (Lean!)
32 dirty birds and they white, look like Michael Jackson
We switch and we smash that shit
You talking bout racks, they stuffed in my MCM bag
Got hit with them dirty, dirty sticks and they were finessed by a bitch
I be playing with them dirty birds like my name Jamaal
Pull up, hop out, I valet the Jag and Kamals'
Actavis that is my medicine
No internet but I'm connected to that white girl, Kevin Federline
I'm strapped with dirty artillery
The bando it got a dispensary
