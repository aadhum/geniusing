Respect the OG's
We thank you; for giving the young niggas the crown
At my motherfuckin' cook house
I never work the warehouse
Cause a young nigga got the crown
Young niggas got the crown
Young niggas got the crown
OG's they respect us
Young niggas got the crown
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Young niggas got the crown (Young niggas)
Young niggas got the crown (Young niggas)
OG's they respect us
Young niggas got the crown
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne) (x4)
Sprayin' the Champagne on the sofa fuckin' up the couch with Louboutin loafers
25 hundred nigga I put in the sole
I be whipping and driving the Lamborghini like it's stolen
Sprayin' champagne all over the damn crowd
You see your favourite rapper bitin' the style
That's cause the Migos we got the crown
Young niggas got the crown
Young niggas got the crown
OG's they respect us
Young niggas got the crown
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne)
Young niggas got the crown (Young niggas)
Young niggas got the crown (Young niggas)
OG's they respect us
Young niggas got the crown
Spray the Champagne (Spray the Champagne) (x4)
