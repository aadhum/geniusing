Girl you standin' right there lookin' so amazing, oh
So I thought I'd say sum, oh
She 5'5", her hair go down to her ass
I can't lie, she fuckin' with me and cash
Don't make her mad, don't make her mad, don't make her mad, no
Gotta buy her a bag, buy her a bag, buy her a bag
She see what I'm lookin' at
I'm lookin' right there at you
Then why I'm not sayin' nothin'?
Cause I'm thinkin' bout fuckin' you
