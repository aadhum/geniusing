Wrapping up chickens,
I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist
treat em like dentist
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack,
so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip,
It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting
Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
I'm servin' them patients,
my money is ancient
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker
molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker
It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting
