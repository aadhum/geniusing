Oh no, no, no, no, I can't be yo baby daddy
Bitch, just leave me alone, gonna put a block on my phone
Hate to say it, little mama, but you gotta beat it, beat it like the OG Michael
I got the clay, beat the pot like I'm Cassius
Drop in Orlando, I'm selling that magic
Asked me for money, but never ain't giving
Wasn't fucking with me before I had a million
Young, rich nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit
