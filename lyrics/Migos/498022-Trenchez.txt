Fucking the natnats and alley cats
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
My plug from Saudi Arabia, call him Aladdin
They call me Chris Angel, work disappear like it is magic
Bill Nye cause I'm whippin up chemicals
Fucking the natnats and alley cats
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
What's that in yo drive-way?
Maybe Karma Fisker (skirr, Fisker?)
That you thought I was Freemason (Freemason)
Fucking the natnats and alley cats
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
The hell is you doin'?
Fuck is you doin'? Where the hell is you goin'?
Make ya brain blow
Murder she wrote
F&N extendo' Subway Footlongs All I tote!
Fucking the natnats and alley cats
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
