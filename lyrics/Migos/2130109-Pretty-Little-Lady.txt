Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, and she got her own
Pretty lil lady, you know she got her own
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Pretty lady, she got her own in her Mercedes
And she single, she thick and grown with no babies
I really wanna take little mama home and go crazy
But she won't let me, I can't do nothing but respect it
She don't care about my money, I sip my tea like Kermit
She don't care bout them hunnids she pull 'em out the purses
I fuck her like a virgin
It's none of my business I ain't worry
But if you got a nigga and you workin' for him
I'ma shoot that nigga, Quavo Stephen Curry
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own
She got excited by my Louboutins
Her stomach so flat like she fastin'
Balenciega, alligator sneakers
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own
[?]
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
I tried to put her on but she already made it
Pretty lil lady, lil lady
And she got her own, she don't need a nigga paper
Little lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady, you're so pretty
Pretty lil lady and she got her own
Pretty lil lady you know she got her own
