Throwin' up the set!
Throwin' up the set!
Yee ain't have a sack, then you had to go get it
Since day one my daddy was a chemist
Whip whip whip whip whippin in the kitchen
I got the white man money, call me Donald Trump
She cookin' like a baker but she not Anita
I keep the O like Gilbert 'Renas
Throwin' up the set!
Throwin' up the set!
Beatin' up the work like Anna Mae
Got a dope tester with the ashy face
Throwin' up the set!
Throwin' up the set!
Got a Chevrolet sittin' on 28s
And I got stripes, call me Jam Master Jay
Throwin' up the set!
Throwin' up the set!
