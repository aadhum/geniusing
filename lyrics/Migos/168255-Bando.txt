Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando,
trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
got tools like Rambo
Got bird like Birdman,
got white like Lindsay Lohan
Made a hundred stacks off the pots and pans
bricks, like Shaq, at the free throw
Got them bricks for the low, I will serve you
got them bricks in the wall and in the floor
Pizzeria way I'm playin' with the dough
If the feds wanna talk, I just tell them I don't know
Fuck twelve!
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando,
trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping in the vacant
serving all my patients
smoke a lot, my eye look Asian
cook it when she naked
Throw it in the microwave, Betty Crocker how I bake it
Trapping in the bando, big guns like commando
Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trapped out the bando,
trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapped out the bando, trapped out the bando
Trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Trap, trapping out the house with the boards on the windows
Foreign bad bitch and she say her name Trina
Traphouse look like it got hit by hurricane Katrina
Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean
Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia
, flipping the work with no spatula
