Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
I had to get my money cause I ain’t have no muscle
RIP to Mike Brown
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp at Benihanas
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
