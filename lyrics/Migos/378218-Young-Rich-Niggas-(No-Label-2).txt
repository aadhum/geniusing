Just now warming up, might pull up in an armored truck
With a hundred blue million bucks
I told you brah, that we so dangerous, yo niggas ain't the same as us
Pocket salad, extra dressing
He always got a nigga flexing
If you wanted to ball
You gotta run with it and score a touchdown
If you wanna be a rap artist
Gotta take over your town (the city!)
If you wanna be a dope dealer
Gotta be moving a pound (Ew! Gas!)
Young nigga just stay focused
(If you did it) You can be rich right now

I was broke I remember
I stashed it away in my memory
I came from roaches to Lotus
Now all my jewelry is golden
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)
Christian Louboutins, I'm not running from my emotions

Hundred gas bags in the monster truck
Usain Bolt, I'ma run it up
Sipping on Actavis out the glass
Hundreds older than the ThunderCats
