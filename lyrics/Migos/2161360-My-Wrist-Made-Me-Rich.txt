I’m fucking with your bitch
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
I might go buy a brick
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
My wrist it made me rich
I’m cooking on my stove
Drinking on Bacardi while I’m stunting through the lobby
Got more bitches down in Follies shaking that for 20 dollars
Young rich niggas all around me
