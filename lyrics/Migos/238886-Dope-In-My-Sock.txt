Young nigga flying pigeons all over the sea
Wrist game got my arm strong, Hercules
Got the molly in the jar look like Dippin' Dots
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
I got the dope in my sock, I got the dope, I got the dope in my sock
Trying to take my dope my nigga
I'm coming to hang you on rope
Feeling like Slick the Ruler
Versace my shirt I love Medusa
Can't get in contact with my plug
So I'm taking a flight to Bermuda
Hit a nigga ass with the Ropa Dope
Cause I see these niggas getting tired
OJ I'm trapping at Texaco
I know some lions some bears some tigers hyenas and even gorillas
My jeweler he call it can cooler it'll buy me shivers
I'm not a DJ but I will remix ya
