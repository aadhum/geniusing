walk in the trap just to see what the fiends like
I got the shooter nigga, I won't miss you
The pot is butt naked
It's a price on your fitted nigga, you better pay attention
You better surrender
Better listen to me, I'm your mentor
I'm not talkin' too much, ain't no lecture
You gon catch all these bullets like Fletcher
