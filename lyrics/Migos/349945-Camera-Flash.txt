All these damn cameras, I pull up in tarantula
I smash yo bitch for a long time I got stamina
Pull up in tarantula you pull up in that Acura
20 bands on that rollie nigga, can't afford it nigga
You a fuck nigga pussy punk boy, Ashton Kutcher
Smokin' good gas and I'm laughing, watching Chris Tucker
All these damn cameras, I pull up in tarantula
I smash yo bitch for a long time I got stamina
Pull off in that all white ferrari, its the swag daddy
Stacks on deck, rich gang,
I touched down in Atlanta,
Louis V on my pajamas,
Soulja Boy ride with the hammer
All these damn cameras, I pull up in tarantula
I smash yo bitch for a long time I got stamina
, extendo as long as a ruler
red beam give you the mark of the Buddha
I tell that bitch run it like Chris
No foundation, but i make a wish,
All these damn cameras, I pull up in tarantula
I smash yo bitch for a long time I got stamina
