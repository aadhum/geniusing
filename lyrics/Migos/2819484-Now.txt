I wanna fuck her but she can't take no racks home
Migos and Gucci we back home (back home)
My pockets stay green like geckoes (green)
What if your wrist get tired Quavo? (huh?)
Then I'ma whip with my elbow (huh)
I screwed the little tip on the silencer so a nigga can shoot with no sound
At first we were trappin' the ounce (ay)
Now we got bricks in the couch (bricks)
Ain't no Thanksgivin' nigga but we still in the trap with the turkeys
Bulletproof vest on, still man down (man down)
If a nigga broke, don't come round (no)
Diamonds cold on me, pneumonia (ice)
Walkin' with fifty racks on me (fifty)
I wish you would run up on me
Play with money like you're play-dough (play-dough)
Put some on your head like a halo (halo)
No OVO I'm with Draco (bwah)
