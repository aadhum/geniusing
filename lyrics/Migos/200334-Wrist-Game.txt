Aye yo' name must be Ray Allen or somethin'
You got game nigga
Ice chain from Johnny Dang,
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
I feel like John Gotti, them bricks in my Masi
Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
