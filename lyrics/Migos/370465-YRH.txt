Chasing the cheese macaroni
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin
No Master P but we bout it
No Master P but I'm bout it, bout it
Tell your bitch we the young rich homies
Better slow your roll jabroni
Walking around with that that tommy gun
So I had to make a mission like the famous Jett Jackson
Got all these pocket rockets on my body
Lookin like a young nigga got go go gadgets
Still beat the pot up like Cassius
Hit the plug in China town, order up another package
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin
No Master P but we bout it
Chasing the cheese macaroni
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin
No Master P but we bout it
[Verse 2: Offset]
Wipe me down, no Boosie
Blue diamonds, no Tookie
Started off in them Honda Accords now Im riding in them Bentleys
Them bullets just like Ritalin, make a nigga calm down instantly
I grab the fork and I cook up a brick
Actavis, I don’t do Qualitest (Lean)
Lettuce and cabbage and broccoli (Cash!)
Hell nah we don’t fuck wit no phonies
And you can tell yo bitch we some young rich homies (yo bitch!!)
Guisepppe stepper, Christian Lubuiton’s, and Maison Margiela
Chasing the cheese macaroni
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell yo' bitch we some young rich homies
Young rich homies, young rich homies
You can tell broke nigga we some young rich homies
We ain't even sign no deal yet, me and Migos we mobbin
No Master P but we bout it
