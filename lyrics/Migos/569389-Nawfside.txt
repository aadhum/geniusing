Wake up in the morning,  gotta thank God
Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the Nawfside
We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day on the Nawfside rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me (2Pac)
Trapping on Club Drive,
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Needed college, I didn't go to Clark
