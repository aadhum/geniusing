Fresh out, outta the bed, count up the deadz (bow, bow)
If I wasn't trappin', I'd be wrappin' up them bundles
If I wasn't rappin', I'd be trappin' out the condos (know I'm sayin')
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anacondas (know I'm sayin')
No forreal, no cap, I keep a sack like Sapp and Tucker (sacks)
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda

Gang bang slang 'caine
Heroin, half a ton, Purple Haze, Cam'ron
Plays off a Samsung, get the job done

You know what I did last night, 'cause I gave her all ones
You niggas in trouble, rock chains by the double
Got dames by the double, do everything but cuddle
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda

Hop out the bed and I'm countin' them faces
I jump out the whip and them bitches start faintin'
No twenties or fifties, just Benjamin Franklins
Block on lock, call me Kurt Angle
If they got a problem, my niggas gon' straighten it
Droppin' them bangers, bangers, bangers
Double cup stuffed full Texas Ranger
I shoot a hundred round clip like Wilt Chamberlain
No forreal, no cap, my money long like anaconda
