I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
