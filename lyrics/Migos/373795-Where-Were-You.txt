Now I am at the top right now, just look at you (where)
The models they watching the niggas they follow (they follow)
Double G all on my collar
Big ass bank rolls won't fold
I'm the number one contender, don't hold grudges because I am a forgiver
Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
