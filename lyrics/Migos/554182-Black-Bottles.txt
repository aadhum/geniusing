Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Pussy niggas wanna see you dead
Cause them pussy niggas never see the bread
Black bottles and the gold chains
Ho swallowin' my whole name (Rozay)
I got some niggas that'll slide for me
In other words, niggas thatâ€™ll die for me
Left hand for the styrofoam
My right hand keep this Calico
I gave my shone a student loan
That bitch's mouth made the honor roll
Down to do work, nigga, no gloves
Just got me 2 birds from ol' boy
I always look out for ol' boy
Belaire, my refrigerator
I ate your bitch out on the dinner table
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Migo! Walkin' out the bando with a 4-5
I can't make the deal, I think he wearing a wire
Pitching hard ball and they hit it, call 'em Mark McGwire
My wrist whip the magic, Quavo Hardaway
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
(Takeoff!) 32 bricks of gold, Karl Malone
Talkin' 'bout you on the block, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
A nigga takin' chains, Debo
24k on my toes
My Maison Margiela's, they rose gold
Trappin' and dabbin', I trap in the rain, sleet, or snow
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
They watchin' a nigga like Blu-Ray
Whippin' up Alicia Keys
You say that you got the big money
But really your money is sesame seeds
My neck is flooded and my double cup is mudded
The streets made me a villain, out that bowl, I made a million
Black bottles and the gold chains
Want the half or the whole thing?
You goin' hard or you goin' home?
You goin' gold or you ridin' chrome?
Black bottles and the gold chains
