Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it

When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school
And I be too fresh, I call it double mints
I was on the block, you was on punishment
Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliments
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
