Jumping out the gym (x2)
No Clyde Drexler money
Jumping out the gym (x3)
No Dominique money
Jumping out the gym
Bands jumpin’ out the gym, no Shawn Kemp
Hurricane wrist,
In the VIP shootin’ nothing but money jump shots
Can't nobody touch me cause my goons like secret service
Smokin' on purp James Worthy, (purp)
Sippin' on pink like Kirby, (lean)
So I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty
I already know he a coward, I already know he sour
He a snake in the grass so I had to cut him off
I call that Georgia Power
Don't get mad at me cause I smashed your bitch
Then I passed her like Chris Paul
Hell nah I don’t need no label
Hundred bands just sitting on the table
Face card so good in da hood
Girbauds with the crease
Aw shit look who it is, the white Dominique
Dominique Wilkins,
more dough than Homer Simpson
I can ball and tell more story than that Rumpelstiltskin
Wood wheel twistin’,
mysterious roof missin’
40K on wrist, and I’m ballin’ fierce
I done shot more jumpers than that Paul Pierce
Or Kevin Garnett, 'cept I don’t even break a sweat
Me and Migos stackin' C-Notes
We on vacation, we skyscrapin’ in East Bahamas
[Hook]
Hook shot like ‘areem Abdul-Jabbar
Or lay it up like Nate Archibald
Twenty-one bands on me, Dominique
Shoot a nigga lights out, Pistol Pete
And I called them birds Beyonce
‘Cause they look good and you know they gon’ sing
Got thigh, got breast, got wings
I dropped three, it wasn’t nothing, Reggie Miller
Man I’m jumpin out the gym, Yao Ming
A nigga keep a steel like Stockton
Shooting jumpshot like Brent Barry, Kyle Korver, Jason Terry
And if a nigga try to take my cash, no Pastor Troy, but we ready
Walk in the store with straight cash, nigga no issue
They like T-James! That's my nigga!
You a real nigga bruh thats why we fuck with ya
My reply is always humble nigga never brag
You want them Jordans, nigga?
I'm on the Air Mags
