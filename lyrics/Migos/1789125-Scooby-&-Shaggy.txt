It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
And I got that chicken, no Mrs. Winners
Red Bentley, Forgiatos on it, call it thriller
You pull up with choppers but are you a killer?
Samurai sword cut the brick, Kill Bill
RIP to Uncle Phil, fresh prince, call me Quavo Will
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Feeling like Marshawn Lynch in the interview, I’m thankful
Walk in the room with these trophies on my neck like you in a banquet
diamond
We in the jungle, my niggas go ape
Sipping Act, daily medication
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
Remember trapping out of Camrys
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
I took the plug’s package
He was like what happened
It was a mystery, Scooby Doo and Shaggy
Scooby Doo, it was a mystery
Touchdown, going down in history
Sorry you missed me, call Scooby Doo, it’s a mystery
