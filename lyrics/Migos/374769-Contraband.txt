That bando music
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Contraband, contraband, contraband
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
Narcotic, narcotic, narcotic
When a nigga growed up wanna be a dope boy
Mama bust in, caught me counting money
Said, "you better not be dealing that coke, boy!"
Contraband contraband contraband
Take down one hundred birds, I'm a country man
The plug is talking Español, I understand
Throwing a brick like Randall Cunningham
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
Beating the pot Mortal Kombat, Jax
The gas is reeking and you need some Axe
I’m fucking your bitch, she a natnat
Smoking OG's from Afghanistan
Bands can’t fit in a rubber band
No football, I'm walking with thigh pads
Beating the dope with the stick and it's magical
Bank of America, walking register
Can’t fuck wit you niggas, too skeptical
Undercover, you work with the federals
OG gas bags and it's medical
Work in my bando
Got cookies they edible
