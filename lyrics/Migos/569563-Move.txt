Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
When the plug make the call, know that I can move the ball
Nigga can you flip it all, can you make a fifty ball
In the streets I’m a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Rick Ross ain’t the only nigga in the world boss
Feeling like I’m lost nigga rerock on the D-block
Fucking with the Chi-town niggas out in O-block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block
Nigga just was cooking, that’s the reason why the stove hot
Seeing money, in my dreams I had a bank roll knot
Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
Told em As-salamu alaykum cause my niggas kept it sacred
I’m feeling like Big Meech I got a hundred million in my vases
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don’t need to count it
I know how to move em, Michael Jackson, I’m a smooth criminal
Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
My nigga trapping out vacants
Million dollars make a nigga motherfucking move
Move, move, move, uh!
Pull out the chopper, everybody move
Raw, baw, raw, graw, get the fuck back
Treat you like a cow, nigga you better move
Moooooove
