I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
breathin' like Toni Brax
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
They done fucked up and freed all of my dawgs
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
I bet you thought you would never see (never!)
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be (momma!)
And she told you you can't have no company (no!)
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
Minor setback for a major comeback
You thought a nigga was gon' fall off (fall off!)
Hahaha, hell no!
Hit em wit, pipe it up, look at my dab
