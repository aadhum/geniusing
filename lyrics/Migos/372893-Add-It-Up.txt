Add it up like a new calculator
In the trap with two guns like I'm Tomb Raider
Jungle fever, got the white and I marry her
Hit a juug, fifty bags of the good cannabis
All these other conversations irrelevant
If you ain't talkin' bout Benjamin Frank
My pockets is healthy, Zanotti Giuseppe
My money is stretching, my money athletic
We fucked the world up when we dropped that "Versace"
It topped the chart, nigga, so add it up
"Versace", it got us a M and 'em
Don't believe me, fuck nigga, then count it up
Trapper turned rapper, my mama happy
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
