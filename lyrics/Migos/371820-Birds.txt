[Intro: Quavo]
Wassup Pablo? What's poppin?
You got them birds? D-low?
I need 'em, I want it
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds
Just hit my phone if you want a bird
You can get a re-rock
We locked and now I can front you
Young nigga that's my word
Walk in the bando, look at all them birds
Bando get low, re-up on the birds
Got shooters on pronto
Don't got no undo
Then 12 tried to get me
For gang activity
The judge dropped the charge, and I thank lord
That's why i take this mic and I go hard
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds
Just got the word, just got the birds
Shabba Ranks gold only kick it with Ferg
plugged in with Italian mobs
Don't never put trust in a broad
Too many birds, my gun is an eagle
When I talk birds, I'm talkin' a kilo!
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds
The plug just hit my phone
For some funions, want an onion
Exotic crocodile skin Martens, call me Dundee
Carlito for a hundred, gave bout 50 to my mama!
I'm an OG in my hood, no Aretha, well respected
Toucan Sam pigeons, call me Ace Ventura, Pet Detective
I see falcons on a daily basis, Takeoff Arthur Blank
Whippin' chickens in the kitchen
Trap smell like a septic tank
My plug Carlito, he can't speak no englo
All he knows is "andale"
Had this dream that I woke up in a 'Rari
I'm too fly, I spread my wings and I'm soaring
Used to trap them birds, now I'm fly like a bird
B-birds
B-b-birds
Birds
