So niggas wanna hate on me
So niggas wanna plot on me

Killed my nigga Pac and Biggie over jealousy
Vegetarian shooter, he gon' kill ‘bout that celery
Niggas plottin' while I’m on vacation in Beverly
Offset told me press the button like the game of Jeopardy

Stomping a fuck nigga out,

Fuck nigga mad, ‘cause I’m a trendsetter

I got the ether like Nas,
I’m telling my nigga go get you because of the money, it itching they palms
"Prrrm doom doom" that’s a hundred round drum
On Sunday in church with my moms
