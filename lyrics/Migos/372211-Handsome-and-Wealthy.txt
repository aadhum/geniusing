Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
It maybe could be my star status
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong
They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbine
Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
