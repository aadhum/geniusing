Back to back, two times
Unfortunately we couldn't beat the case
Fuck it we outta jail anyway
Red and white coupe like a candy cane
Pop a perc, it feel like Bruce Wayne
Chop a brick like I'm Tsung Shang
Bitch I'm dabbin' in my own lane
Chokeslam a nigga, Quavo Kane
Cause my money taller than a great dane
We gave the world dab fever check
Quavo Derek Jeter, keep a street sweeper
I'm a salt water alligator eater
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
I just ate a burger from Five Guys
I'm smokin' on cookies from High Times
Ain't talkin' bout Drexler
When they come to that dope, nigga, I bet it's gon' glide
Ain't talkin' bout Dexter
Cook in the laboratory,
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
We the niggas make the birds fly
My wrist cost a motherfuckin' 'Rari
Thugger daughter motherfuckin' tired (my niece)
Baby bottles, ain't no babies cryin' (drank)
