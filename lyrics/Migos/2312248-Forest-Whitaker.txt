We got big guns like Marvin
I'm spittin' fire like a arson
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Came from the gump, no Forrest
One eye open like I'm Forest
(Who you talkin' 'bout?)
Break in your safe house like Whitaker
got a butler in it
And the nigga name is Cecil
I'm the last king on the North
So I gotta look out for my people
Mansion got a panic room in it
Came from the gump, I'm feeling like Forrest
Walking the trap I'm experimenting
Street kings off a bling bling
It's a brand new day and a bird gon' sing
Yung Rich Nation we just living the dream
All this gold like I'm livin' in Zulu
Welcome to my kingdom like Shaka Zulu
We got big guns like Marvin
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
Stake out for the check, Forest Whitaker
Bloodsport, shit can get physical
No Forrest, but I'm in the phone booth
My diamonds shining take a peep at you
Canary yellow diamonds, Pikachu
Everyday's Halloween we pulling out costumes
And these kids love me like I'm a cartoon
The streets are like the Vietnam war
When the bitches see me they get star struck
We got big guns like Marvin
You talking bout gas, we having a forest
