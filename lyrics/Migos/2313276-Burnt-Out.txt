I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
That's a life sentence, quarter mill on my wrist (damn)
You can test the dope with your pinky finger
Now he feeling like a Power Ranger
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in an all black, like I'm John Wick
Walking with a dirty stick long as an antenna
I don't give a fuck about no nigga feelings
Got the chopper for the victims
Mumma told me to go kill em'
So I'm in all black, like I'm John Wick
