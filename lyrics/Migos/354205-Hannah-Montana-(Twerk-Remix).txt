She been twerkin twerkin twerkin (twerkin)
All damn night
[Quavo]
Hannah Montana she twerk on the top of my Phantom
(twerk twerk)
She a college girl but her wrist Katrina
katrina call FEMA
In the kitchen and she baking like Anita
No Buffy the Body
She ain't got a lot of booty but she still go crazy (lil booty)
[Takeoff]
Got your main bitch on the Hannah, she droppin' and poppin' no castles
I'm smokin' on gas like tobacco, I'm drinkin' on lean taste like Snapple
In the V.I.P. rollin' a cord, passin' out mollies to foreigns
They poppin' 'em like they some Skittles, 2 bitches one me, Malcolm in the middle
Hop off up in the new Bugatti, cameras flashin' paparazzi
She poppin' that capsule, no Nazi
I'm twistin' the rock like I'm Rocsi
She sweatin' like she ran a mile, she soakin' wet she need a towel
She suckin' her lip, bitin' down
She moanin' and makin' them sounds
She came while she suckin' me now
I'm lookin' at her like damn
Hannah makin' them go bananas
She fuckin' and suckin' on camera
Pop a Hannah, she got stamina
My jag, still a Panorama
I'm beatin' the pussy like Michael, I call her Dirty Diana
She popping the X no Malcolm
Drop it low like Miley Cyrus
