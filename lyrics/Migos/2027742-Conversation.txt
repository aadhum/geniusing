Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She got a flower in her ear, she look like she came from Hawaii
Wanna lock her down, wanna lock her down like it's slavery
Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Can you handle it after the young nigga handled that?
Start it, fifty percent in trunk, that's a truckload
No, baby, we gotta have safe sex
I'm a beat it, beat it 'til it bruise
Ooh, listen to your voice's meditation
Ooh, I'm lovin' the moves she makin'
Ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
She turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
Ooh, ooh, she turn me on wit' her conversation
