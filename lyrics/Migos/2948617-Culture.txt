They try to play us, they play themselves
(808 Mafia) This the intro
For all you fuckboys that ever doubted the Migos
You played yourself! (Another one)
Fuckboy, bow down
[Hook: Takeoff & DJ Khaled]
Spin off in the coupe, typhoon (skrt skrt)
I act an ass, baboon
Wrappin' that dope, cocoon
Young rich nigga in the room
Finesse a nigga, no raccoon
Spendin' M&M's in June
Took a trip to Cancun
CULTURE album comin' soon (Another one)
Fucked a bitch and hit the lot
Nigga fumblin' with the pot
I broke my wrist in the pot
Hit the block, brought back a knot
JJ Watt is on the block (woop woop)
Act pints in the attic
Pussy niggas puttin' on an act (act)
Thumbin' through a hundred
Thumbin' through a hundred racks
Heard you talkin' through the wire today
I'ma pull up with that fire, aim at his eye
I bet he gon' die today
Yeah, screw that lil' tip on that dirty lil' Uzi (yeah)
I put a seven in a thot coochie (yeah)
Niggas get money, don't know how to use it (yeah)
I whipped up the babies, Harambe, abused it
Pourin' lean on the rocks (mud)
I'ma let the semi talk (whole K)
Now he swimmin' with the dolphins
Perky got me feelin' nauseous
Don't come around with the nonsense (uh-uh)
[Hook: Takeoff & DJ Khaled]
Spin off in the coupe, typhoon (skrt skrt)
I act an ass, baboon
Wrappin' that dope, cocoon
Young rich nigga in the room
Finesse a nigga, no raccoon
Spendin' M&M's in June
Took a trip to Cancun
