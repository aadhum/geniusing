From the jail cell, my wrist so sick it got sickle cell
Working my wrist like a ferris wheel
You say this and that what my pocket fill
We don't spare no nigga, cut his head off and show me he's real
We got diamonds and gold ain't no stainless steel
Independent we didn't take a deal
I know you heard about the fight
I know you heard about the shoot
I know you heard a nigga ruthless
It's 50 thousand for a viewing
Bitch you see the dab
When I copped the Coupe they was mad at me
Hoes calling me the dab daddy
Bettin' poker chips I ain't playing Madden
I'm a rich nigga, you can check my status
Passed chemistry and failed mathematics
Money counter do the adding
I bought a carpet from aladdin
So I can finesse and do magic
Shoutout to YRN Lingo
that my world
