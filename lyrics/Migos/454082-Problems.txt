I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
I'mma wrap my money it look like Oprah Winfrey
And I'm master selling them P’s,
I sang to your bitch and she call me Mariah
I’m with PeeWee Longway
You know I’m not Kanye, but I been rocking since the first day
I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
My diamonds they black just like Willie B
Porsche Panamera, one button, top gone
All these bad bitches, Spanish hoes, Hong Kong
Birds singing like harmony but I don’t need a bone
I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
Without throwing on true, your religion is fool
Whipping that Yayo, looking like mayo
It come from Barbados, my wrist is tornado
I been balling so long but I don’t want no problems
Keep that FN in reach, but I don’t want no problems
Pullin up in YSL, these young niggas got problems
