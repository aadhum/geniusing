On Santa Monica boulevard, I got you Jimmy Choo
Come come, come on, come on, asap, asap, right now, pronto
On Santa Monica boulevard, I got you Jimmy Choo
Bally, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis, fuck a stylist
I’m sipping on Activis, you sipping Hypnotiq
Lambo fast call it Devin Hester
I’m flexing, call me Sylvester
Stallone, I keep the chrome
Macaulay Culkin, you’re home alone
I gave your bitch a molly, she rolling, no stone
Got on Gucci, Louis, Fendi but that gas is my cologne
On Santa Monica boulevard, I got you Jimmy Choo
