Meet me in the trap, I'm having pounds
Niggas having straps, don't come around
Niggas having all white, yeah, that step-down
Just hit me when you need me, I'll pull up on you right now (x2)
All white diamonds like RiFF RAFF
Meet me in the bando, flippin' bricks like it's a sandal
I've got O's, no nouns
