Yo, nice to meet you
Adios
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
On the islands cooling like Gullah Gullah
I'm independent I ain't trying to sign to Warner Brothers
We'll take ten mil' for a Label deal
wrist still a hurricane
In a Audi getting brain, swerving in the other lane
fleet
fleet
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
I got dreads like I'm from the islands
Smokin' weed like I'm from the islands
Dolla Sign and Migos we the trendsetters
Pushaz Ink the label we the trendsetters
Rum and coke, she drink pi√±a colada
I only smoke kush, these niggas still on the chronic
Met a red bone, in bikini bottoms
Look just like Rihanna, say she from the islands
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
Feels good to be rich
The plug on the islands, no Gilligan
I be with the migos, no Mexican
I ride in a Maybach, no Ross
Lions, bears, and tigers
Bad bitches givin' knowledge
Choppas on deck like Iran
On the islands, no Gilligan
You niggas are sweeter than Cinnamon
My loafers are 'gator amphibians
How the hell you don't know Benjamin ?
His pack went missin', a mystery
We taking trips, on the islands
My bitch bad, she from the islands
Where the plug? He on the islands
No Gilligan, I'm on the islands
