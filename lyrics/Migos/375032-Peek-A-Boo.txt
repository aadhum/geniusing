My bitches addicted to Michael Kors
I got the white like a chalkboard
Break in the trap you gon' pay for it
20 pairs of Christian Louboutins
Pick a shoe, pick a shoe, pick a shoe
Thundershock the pot like Pikachu
Momma said try different avenues
Most of my people they didn't believe until I turned into a Hercules

Just left the jeweler
I bought a Yacht-Master, the master yacht
I just bought a Bentley Mulsanne
They callin' me samurai the way I chop the top
Steve Nash, I pass the rock
That Rolex ain't real if it tic-toc
Pissy my diamonds in China
