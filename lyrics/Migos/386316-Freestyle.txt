[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings
I shoot at your children
Pull up and kill 'em don't care bout no feelings
I pop out and shoot at the city
I'm cooking big birds and chickens
I'm going far as the stars, are you afraid of heights?
The sky is my limit
You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members
Hannah Montana
banging in red bandana
10 thousand dollars toe ring right inside of my sandals
My bitch understand us, she ride with the nana
She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Plus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)
Imma pull up leave it running
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
She thought that I grabbed on my stomach
(tummy!)
Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic
I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
Young nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover
(12!)
In the kitchen and I'm whipping the pot
And it's getting thick on me like peanut butter
"Baw, glaw !")
Me and my Migos illegal but that choppa legal
Set the bitch off like I'm Queen Latifah
In Puerto Rico kicking it with Carlito
He put me on Chico he gave me a kilo
You fuck niggas taking my lingo
Pull up on you get my shit back like I'm repo
We fucking these bitches you cuffin' her
Bet you don't know she be sucking me while you've be kissing her!
Offset fucked her, Quavo fucked her, but you fucking that bitch with no rubber
These bitches be trippin', fucked all my brothers
And expect for me to love her!
(I could never love her)
Pull up and I got the Tommy aim it at yo' head I turn it to an omelette
I'm connected like Vonage
I run to the money I'm faster than Sonic
Got your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary
'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci
I'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery
Run in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper
Pour a 4 in the 2 liter
Christian Louboutin, walking on hyena
Beat it like Tina
beat it like Jackson
My niggas they all about action, no camera
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
I got the white call it Pamela, Anderson
White Lambo Jennifer Aniston
Black diamonds, I call it African
Offset fresher than a mannequin
YRN plugged in with Rich Gang
We got plenty money, diamond chains
I drank a 4 and now I'm leanin'
She drank her a 4 and now we leanin'
I didn't even cry homie
How many Ms, I got circles
Migos got a birdie of it
She just wanna do it cause she know that she a dime
If you ain't got no rollie she do not waste her time
