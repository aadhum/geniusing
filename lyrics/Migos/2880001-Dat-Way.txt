Yo, yeah, Dat Way
I mean, you know this not a diss record
I don't sneak diss
This just for the record, just facts
Your artists be taking my swag
When I go get a new Bentley I just want to double park it on the curb
Lil Yachty brought back us some milli's
It's time to go splurge, it's time to go splurge
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Pick up the phone and call Kanye
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Your artists be taking my swag
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Then I pick up that Backwood and spark
I land in Cali, my plug pull up on me with pints of the Act
I  don't want no Wockhardt
Make your hoe ride along with me
Got unfinished business, got me feeling like Kevin Hart
Niggas gon' act like they 'bout that life, 'til you pull up on them, see that it's not in their heart
The nigga you think be the coolest  a groupie, he put on a act like he shooting a movie
Kicked them with fashion, I'm talking my dab and they thought it was Newton, then you must be stupid
We got the keys to the street, I gotta use it
Got me running to the M&M's, I'm thinking it's a rat race
I pull up with a 'Yonce Lemonade
J's test the dope, said it was Parkay
I been trapping, it's a long day
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
My bitch is bad and boujee
Wipe my red bottoms down like I'm Boosie
Pick up the phone and call Tunechi
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
