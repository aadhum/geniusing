Versace Versace Versace
2Pac and Christopher Wallace
I just came home from the slammer
Lindsay Lohan and Amanda
Feelin' like Tony Montana, the world is mine,I ain't lyin'
Three days ago young nigga was sitting doing time
minds
Kickin 'em doors, sellin' them bows , whippin' them O's
This ain't no rap, cause a nigga done did it
Don't believe me? Nigga go ask the critics
