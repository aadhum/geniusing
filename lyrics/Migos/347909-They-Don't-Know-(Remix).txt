(Intro)
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)

[Verse 1: Rico Love]
I’m the one you be texting
When you be up at your job (They don’t know)
I’m the one that brought that Benz that’s in your garage (They don’t know)
I’m the reason you don’t stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it’s all yours
They don’t know
On your birthday I’m the one who saw your birthday suit (They don’t know)
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe (They don’t know)
I keep it all real
I ain’t gotta tell lies to you
You’re the only one who knows the truth

[Hook]
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t even know I know you
You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t
[Hook]
Your head game is critical
