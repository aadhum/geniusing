If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andale
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Public Service Announcement
Where all my rich niggas at, man?
YRN shit, man
MIGO!
[Hook: Takeoff]
Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right
Lil' mama, she keep looking at me (lil' mama!)
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Hit it with the left, hit it with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
I'ma knock the pussy out like fight night
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume
Talking crazy, I pull up andale
R.I.P to Nate Dogg, I had to regulate
Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Quavo
Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble young nigga rumble!
Ice Cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef
my bitches they skrippers
My niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms
If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Bad bitch make it clap, like Magnolia
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya
These bitches they be smokin' on hookah
my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers
Pull up in the Double R, go scare ya bitch, Freddy Krueger
Flooded Franck Muller
