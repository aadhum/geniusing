They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
Pussy nigga, we made it
Pussy nigga, we made it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
They thought I wouldn’t make it
Thought I wouldn’t make it
Pussy nigga, we made it
Pussy nigga, we made it
The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota,
trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top,  Migo gang
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker
It was all a dream like Biggy
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say ... fuck the feds
Smokin gas,
sipping mud,
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!
Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son"
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, "Quavo you might run into the wrong one"
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
(Versace!) Damn right I changed my life
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single
Young Rich Niggas 2 ...
