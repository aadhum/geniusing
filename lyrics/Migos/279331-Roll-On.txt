Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Then I take the pot and turn the stove on
Skrr! Skrr! Cook a brick with my gold on
The gas is lookin' like mucus
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
Why you think that con crib is payed for?
Crib it got no neighbors
Stackin' up this money
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
I'm striking these hoes like I'm bowling
I'm sippin on codeine
I'm sellin' that white
That Mary and Ashley, that Zack and that Cody
the Bentley is loaded
Milwaukee you know I got bucks
Know some niggas on my team play with yayo
I know niggas pop and roll no Fabo
I got Molly, I got white, OJ Mayo
