Oooh, oooh! Somebody done told you wrong!
Beginning to feel like Ms. Jackson done got cloned
Boom Boom Room
In the wind, she was my friend
Like Princess Di before she died,
therefore we tried and tried again
But in the end you pay attention to the pluses
But the minuses behind make it seem like you can't win
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Round two, a single parent, what is Big to do?
Throw a parrty? Not hardly; I'm trying to stay up outta that womb
Or that p-u-s-s uss, I said uss
Luther Vandross couldn't make a home out of this house that we smooshed
The cat got sold, the dog got old, the food got cold
Both of our tempers were on swolle
For the most, part you fuss, fight, fart
You build it up to break it down and now take it from the start
Repeatedly leading a path that only ends in a clash
Of two stubborn minds, grown folks blind to the sign
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
Tape
Throw your neck out
Throw your back out
