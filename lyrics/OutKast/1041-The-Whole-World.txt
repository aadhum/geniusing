Okay, here we go
Yeah I'm afraid, like I'm scared as a dog
But I've got a new song,
See this is the way that we walk on a sunny day
When it's rainin' inside and you're, all alone
All alone, yeah!
Cause the whole, world, loves it when you don't get down
(Bah bah-da, bah bah bah-da da)
And the w
And the whole, world, loves it when you're in the news
Now if his momma is a quarter daughter must be a dime
I don't even play the radio neither
Only if I need to know the sports or the weather
Throw the Porsche at you, is what I'm forced to do
Dread that nappy shit up, throw a shell in it
Whatever floats your boat, or finds your lost remote
I take my shades off
If you look straight in my eyes, you still might see a disguise
Raw with the rhyme, I'm slick with the slime
I catch a beat runnin' like Randy Moss
I'm rollin' my stone, gather no moss
Or rock your own boat like Aaliyah
then talk
Back, back, forth, forth
Get that sailor on course, course
Make that track a corpse, corpse
Turn on the TV and everything is lookin' dismal
Went in the bathroom medicine cabinet Pepto-Bismol
Need it for my stomach cause my tummy kinda aches
Like a junkie on withdrawal, fresh up off the plate
Wait, back to the enemy of the state
Is the Republicans or Democratic candidate?
Debate,
now even the black box hold the fate
Clueless like Shaggy and Scooby befo' commercial break
we in this to replenish yo' musical wish list
The only liable limitation is yourself, Dre
