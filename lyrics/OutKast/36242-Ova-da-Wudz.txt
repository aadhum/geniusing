Something's gotta give!
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin? Uhh
Herndon homes, unh, Martel homes, Carver homes, Techwood
Martin Luther King, Bankhead
Under-cover, over the hills and through the woods I go
Like green lights
a southern nigga that's comin fo' yo' throat
But not no guillotine see, we be them southern playas
Remember the football socks, aerobic Reeboks
I got an ounce of dank and a couple of drinks so let's crank up a session
Like Tri-City high school
was pulling em in a broke down Rabbit
I spit a couple of words and laying em down was just a habit
Just like Smokey, choking off da pee-wee that we rolled up
Talking about the clique will get you laid down hella swoled up
Hootie hoo slapped ya boys across the cheek with Isotoners
Tell em Big Boi did it
I swear that nigga be rhyming
Every lyric that he spit be turning charcoals into Diamonds and Pearls
Girl when you giving up them draws, cause
I got a couple of niggas down the hall
That wanna hit it too, I'm not the type to be acting selfish
Set it out and let it out and I'll be right back just like Elvis
Cause the postman rings twice...
Hey Mr. Postman....
we from, ATL
Put tha SWATS SWATS on yo' car
Let's travel far, tha southern star shines
Everybody wanna get signed, but (here to tell you)
Record companies act like pimps
Getting paid off what we made when we the ones that's fly like blimps
But ain't no Goodyear
Just willing to get what I deserve my kids to have a mother
And a little house, with a dog in the backyard goin "woof-woof"
Who knows what I must face soon's I leave this recording booth
Poof, back in the real world where birds fly
From Miami by way of Cuba to whoever wants to get that high
There's clouds of clowns, seas of G's
Pro-jects, packed with playas meditating on their knees
Just to make them ends meet, like ground beef
you won't believe
The shit that niggas attempt cause they got other mouths to feed
Besides they own
Its some hoes in this house, damn right
I'm thinking about the way you skull me, girls be
Sucking me dry like deserts Mojave
Gotti
Liking the way you do me, screw me it make my money flip
Shaking that ass for daddy putting this gas off in my Cadi-llac
Back
don't ever snap, packing the gats and pimping whores
Hors d'oeuvres
Back in the days when I was broke I'd snatch your fucking necklace
