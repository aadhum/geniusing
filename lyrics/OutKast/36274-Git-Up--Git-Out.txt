Nigga, you need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
[Verse 1: Cee-Lo]
I don't recall, ever graduating at all
Sometimes I feel I'm just a disappointment to y'all
Every day, I just lay around, then I can't be found
Always asking "Gimme some," living life like a bum
Times is rough, my auntie got enough problems of her own
Nigga, you supposed to be grown
I agree, I try to be the man I'm 'posed to be
But negativity is all you seem to ever see
I admit, I've done some dumb shit, and I'm probably gon do some mo'
Why not? My music's all that I got
But some time must be invested for this to be manifested
I know you know but I'm gon' say this to you I...
Get high but I don't get too high
So what's the limit 'posed to be?
That must be why you can't get your ass up out the bed before three
You need to git up, git out, cut that bullshit out
Ain't you sick and tired of having to do without?
Damn, what up with all these questions?
You act as though you know something I don't
Do you have any suggestions?
'Cause every job I get is cruel and demeaning
Sick of taking trash out and toilet bowl cleaning
But I'm also sick and tired of struggling
I never ever thought I'd to have resort to drug smuggling
Naw, that ain't what I'm about
Cee-Lo will just continue traveling his route
Without any doubt or fear
I know the Lord ain't brought me this far so he could drop me off here
Did I make myself clear?
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why
Well, uh, get up, stand up, so what's said, you dickhead
See when I was a youngster, used to wear them fucking Pro Keds
My mama made me do it
but the devil, he made me smart
Told me to jack them weak ass niggas for they fucking Starters
I wore with tank tops to show off my tattoo, thought I was cool
I used to hang out with my daddy's brothers, I call them my uncles
They taught me how to smoke herb, I followed them when they ran numbers
So in a sense I was Rosemary's baby
And then I learned the difference between a bitch and a lady
Hell, I treat 'em all like hoes, see I pimped 'em
Bitch never had my money, so I never whipped 'em
A playa ain't a gangsta but a playa can handle his shit, bitch
Smoke out, 'cause it's all about money, money, money
Yeah I said it, a nigga sporting plaits and a Braves hat
I hang with Rico Wade
'cause the Dungeon is where the funk's at, boy
I'm true to Organized, 'cause they raised me
I'm also down with LaFace 'cause L.A. Reid, yeah, he pays me
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why
A lot of people in my past tried to do me, screw me
Throw me over in the fire, let me get chunky and charred
Like a piece of wood
and them spirits got the mutant's mind
I'm getting paranoid and steady looking for the time
It's eight in the morning and ain't nobody up yet
I'm digging through the ashtray, hoping to have a good day
I had Jamaica's best and when I light it up, I hear a voice in my head
(You got to git up, git out and git something)
Now I know it's on, my day is finally started
break out quick, in my slick
'84 Sedan DeVille,
Out the Point to Campbellton Road
Everybody know about that killa that we call blow
Keep your eyes peeled for the COBRA unit
'Cause they known for jumping out of black Chevy trucks and through the fog
Here come the Red Dogs, I'm busting out around the corner in my hog
'Cause I have no time for jail
Fuck Clampett cops; fuck Elgin Bell
And crooked ass Jackson, got the whole country
Thinking that my city is the big lick for '96
Hootie Hoo, my White Owls are burning kind of slow
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high, nigga
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
That's why
Y'all telling me that I need to get out and vote, huh. Why?
Ain't nobody black running but crack-kers, so, why I got to register?
I thinking of better shit to do with my time
Never smelled aroma of diploma, but I write the deep ass rhymes
They laying my mama off of work, General Motors tripping
But I come home banked like Hank, from licking and dipping
Doing dumb shit, not knowing what a nigga know now
Yeah, that petty shit will have you cased up and locked down
I dips, over to East Point, still actin' a fool
Wasting my time in the school, I'd rather be shooting pool
Cool is how I played the tenth grade
I thought it was all about macking hoes and wearing pimp fade
Instead of being in class, I'd rather be up in some ass
Not, thinking about them six courses that I need to pass
Damn, that's fucked up. I should've listened when my mama told me
That, if you play now, you gonna suffer later
Figured she was talking yang yang, so I payed her no attention
And kept missing the point she tried to poke me with
The doper that I get, the more I'm feeling broke as shit
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't let the days of your life pass by
You need to git up, git out and git something
Don't spend all your time trying to get high
You need git up, git out and git something
How will you make it if you never even try?
You need to git up, git out and git something
'Cause you and I got to do for you and I
