[Verse 1: Andr√© 3000]
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it..
And there's a fine line between love and hate you see
Came way too late, but baby I'm on it..
Can't worry bout, what a nigga think now see
That's Liberation and baby I want it..
Can't worry bout, what anotha nigga think
Now that's Liberation and baby I want it..
[Verse 3: Cee-Lo]
Seven and forty days.. heyyy
Oh lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my owwwwn
All on my owwwwn, weeeeeee..
We alive or we ain't livin, that's why I'm givin until it's gone
Cause I don't wanna be alone
(I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone.. yeahhhheeeeee
[Verse 4: Erykah Badu]
Folk in your face, you're a superstar
Niggas hang around cause of who you are
You get a lot of love cause of what you got
Say they happy for you but they really not
Sell a lot of records and you roll a Benz
Swoll up in the spot, now you losing friends
All you wanna do is give the world your heart
Record label tried to make you compromise your art
You make a million dollars, make a million mo'
First class broad treat you like a nigga po'
[Verse 5: Big Rube]
I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't we in Kansas no mo' though
Midwest or Dirty South
Whether robbin preachers
killin Poor Righteous Teachers
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals who babble
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethern happen
Just by rappin..
LIBERTAD
