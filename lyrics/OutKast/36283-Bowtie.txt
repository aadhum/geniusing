(Lucius Left Foot)
[Hook: Sleepy Brown & Jazze Pha]
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Cummerbund with no suspenders,
my torpedo, you libido
I'm your r-o-l-a-i-d-s, release the squeeze
Smack on smack on some of this Dick Tracy
Arrest her, book her, fingerprint your hooker
You took her to the club and now her body is full of liquor
Off that Butterscotch Schnapps and Bailey's Irish Cream
She's a damsel in distress impressed with stylish things
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Oh, lord, how can it be so hard?
To put on a pair of panties much less a pair of jeans or the leotard
But I got to start by complimenting you on your physique
You unique, you best believe I'm gon' skeet once I speak
Spoke, spit, spatter, spat and I macked her just like that
But it takes years of perseverance and experience to get that cat
So why don't I chase this Hennessy down with some of that
On your back, like a cheerleader missing the final stack
Everybody's watching cause them furs just hit the door
While the gator's creeping, crawling, oh so wicked across that floor
To the V.I.P. where
we proceed to give you what you need
Throw your hands up if you feel me
Throw your hands up if you feel me
'Cause we well designed, like the finest wine
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
Crocodile on my feet
Fox fur on my back
Bowtie 'round my neck
That's why they call me the gangsta mack
In the Cadillac, yeah
