Back when I was a freshman
I learned a valuable lesson
A ho gon be a ho and
It don't matter about you stressin'
The only thing you do is tap that throat and wear protection
And only when she spit it out is when you feel rejection
Evidence and DNA drop down, stainin her dress
She's making a great big mess, can I get something off your chest?
I, I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
I wanna get into you
I don't want no girlfriend, just wanna get into you
Ice and tone her glove, bedding nicely cause we go good together
Like Salt-N-Pepa, Kool Aid and sugar, mustard and mayonnaise
Don't we always have a blast as we bust one on one
One on one
