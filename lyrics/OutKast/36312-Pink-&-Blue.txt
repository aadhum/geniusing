Pretty pink, baby blue
Why don't (why don't) you teach me something new
We're all (we're all) just babies in my view
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
So crawl baby
Crawl baby
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs?
Same here, and actually I think that's funky
(In a Claire Huxtable type way)
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun
