I'll be coming around the ghetto when I come kicking one for the treble
Y'all can't stoop to my level, I'm like the devil or whatever
I'm picking em up and throwing em down like dishes
Call me Kenny Anderson cause I slam the sons of bitches
They'll be fucked up when I gets into my calling mode
Oh no, then dance on top of they asses like Jo Jo Dancer
Come Comet, come Dasher, come Prancer
Come niggas with machine guns, I think that is the answer
But the question "Should we take that bullshit from them people?"
I'm making 300 on my SAT yet I am equal
Ain't no sequel, no saga, no way out, I'm nervous
I've had it up to fo'head of suckas tryin to serve us
To graduate is really becomin a very stressful journey
I feel like a steering wheel, for them is trying to turn me
Into a hate monger,
and I'm wishing and I wonder
Damn, will I graduate before I hit the summer
I think not,
Officer Friendly tryin to dig up in me
He said I'm half assed and got no future
And so he sent me up the creek and shit
Stroking like hell without no paddle
But niggas is gettin smart, we back on the saddle
No longer, y'all know y'all had us down for some years
It's the call of da wild nigga, uh, there it is
I hear voices in my head and they keep calling me
As I step up, the stage is empty
No words cause I serve with my Southern dialect, so I get respect
Let my nuts hang down to the flo' mane
Smoking that dang dang,
In my 2-8-0 Z, nobody can see me, cruising down the block
Just like I was a squirrel in a world full of nuts
Damn, I'd probably be mad even if I called Uncle Sam
To bring dough to the Goodie Mo-B
T-Mo, Khujo, Cee-Lo, J and my homie Brandon B
Rolling with Outkast, PA, Goodie Mob for the 94
Yeah, I'm steady bucking muthafuckas
Not ducking 'em like duck goose
I'm heavily strapped, yeah niggas
Squeezing rhymes like that noose around your neck
You can't hang with this, see ain't no thangs to this
I show no pity so take off because I'm dangerous
I breaks 'em off like I was Beat Street, see I be breaking
Speaking of breaking, break on out or get your life taken, boy
Fucking around with me will get your cabbage cut, your wig split
Simply means I'm bringing the funk with the hollow tips
Coming around the ghetto, victims soft as a tack on a jackass
Puffy afro with nigga naps off in my hair
yeek
See I'm a playa, got my struggle on
Thinking about the volume and thickness of my bankroll
You see the cops is in my shit like colon cancer
Even though I never smoke that shit like (right)...yeah
I give a call of da wild to my niggas around the projects
So don't flex or get served with a pop neck shit
OG, original gangsta, not quite
But maybe when I'm locked up, lifting weights, getting swole right
Life's a bitch with a G-string, it's either in your ass or it ain't
I got more problems than the average Joe
So bro don't come 'round me with your flim flam, hot damn
Shhh... Mr. Knighton take off your hat
Parkay
This is your brain on drugs, this is your brain...
Dope cut niggas I hang with before there were apartments
In Chappell Forest
