Shit man
Nigga gotta go on and gyat damn
Get the shit straight when I god damn get out
Well shit
This what really goin down
I'm a G from C.P. I can't take the shit
They got a nigga on some "Sir, yessir, left right left"
Throw me in the hole if my ass outta step
They treat you like a motherfuckin slave
Dopefiends find Jesus, swear they saved
Niggas better get they game tight
Cause these crackers tryin to take a nigga life and they rights
I'm surrounded by fake-ass crooks
They swear they kingpins but don't have money on they books
I hear so many lies it make me sick
These niggas called ballers sellin dimes and nicks
I'm Audi 5 nigga lights out
