[Hook: Big Boi]
From the weave to the fake eyes
To the fake nails, down to the toes
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Ha ha ha ha! We luv deez hoez
Don't lie you love them, if you don't you like them hoez a whole lot
Just like your mama Sunday cookin' turkey necks in the pot
You ready to drop your load like prop planes be droppin' that cocaine
You ready to turn your fro, from natural straight to a cold wave
Dat ho name Betty Big Shoez, she wore them Herman Munster heels
Popped a pill, now she's in your Coupe De Ville, passenger seat
I made her eat my meat while I was rubbin' her coochie
Injection in her top and bottom lip straight from her booty
So Do Re, blow me, Fa So La Ti Da Ha I'm tellin' the truth
You suckin' your tooth you treatin' her like a star boy
She tried to pull my rubber off with her pussy muscles that was wrong
The bitch is no good like lesbians with no tongues
You fucked around and knocked her up and now you say she the one
Nigga you dumb, you should have pulled it out and squirted on her eyelash
And let her face be holdin' the baby, now she after yo ass!
Yeah, I told y'all niggas
About god damn takin' them hoez to the Cheesecake Factory
Lettin' them hoez order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimps
They ain't goin' do nuthin'
But try to take all your motherfuckin' cheese! (Yeah!)
Ay, ay, what's up lil' girl I see you workin' them Valente
She walk wit a fly Sashay
Mr. Fat Face
You love the way the leather grippin' your butt
Conversation kill 'em, drippin' em up
Relax Shawty, oh lordy, I quote the facts
Whippin' convertible with Daddy Fat Sax
I stay G sharp as a note of music
[Verse 3: Big Gipp]
Met up in Cafe Intermezzo for some late night pastry
Conversation hasty cause I was ready to dip
Fell in, hit her with the garden hose
