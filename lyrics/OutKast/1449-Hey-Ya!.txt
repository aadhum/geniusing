[Intro]
1, 2, 3: go!
My baby don't mess around
Because she loves me so
And this I know for sho
But does she really want it
But can't stand to see me
Walk out the door?
Don't try to fight the feeling
Cause the thought alone is killing me right now
Thank God for Mom and Dad
For sticking through together
Cause we don't know how
[Verse 2]
If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
Then what makes, then what makes, then what makes
Then what makes, what makes, what makes
Love the exception?
So why oh why why oh why
Are we so in denial
When we know we're not happy here?
Y'all don't want to hear me, you just want to dance
Don't want to meet your daddy, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want you in my Caddy, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Don't want to meet your mama, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Just want to make you cumma, Uh-oh, Hey ya! Uh-oh
Now what's cooler than being cool?
(Ice cold!)
(Ice cold!)
OK: now ladies
(Yeah?)
Lend me some sugar, I am your neighbor!
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it, sh-shake it
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
(Get on the floor) Shake it like a Polaroid picture
You know what to do Shake it, sh-shake it
Oh, you know what to do!
