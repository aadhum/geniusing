A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive
The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive

And that's why I tell a lot of parents

I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on
And that's what I did
I moved on
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a pain
But she's alive

A boy to raise
At... at a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
A boy to raise
At a young age
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must be a drag
But she's alive

A boy to raise
At a young age...
No help from him
But she's alive
To be made strong
But all alone
Must...
