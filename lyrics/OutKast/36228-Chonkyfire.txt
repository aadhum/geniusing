Yo, this is my story, this is my song
And to them rudypoos don't attempt to try this at home
It's just a poem until y'all learn right from wrong
Know when to bless a situation, when to grab the chrome
We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
You are now about entering the fifth dimension of ascension
Our only intention is to take you high
High, yeah, yeah my lord
Some of y'all MC's take this rhymin' for granted, I won't comply
With that slackin', poppin' and crackin' Fourth Ward say we snappin'
They want that hardness that oddness that gets a nigga to start this
playing the King like Don doe
Makin' them think Hip Hop is dead, exhume the body if you ain't scared
And if I see you in the streets I'd dap you down like you was Greg yeah
We reign, reign, supreme, preme, dungeon, dungeon kings
Do you know what brings rats, mice, snakes up out of they hole?
Chonkyfire, spiced with rock n'roll indubitably, piper pied
