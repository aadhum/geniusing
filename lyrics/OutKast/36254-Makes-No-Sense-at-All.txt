here's looking at you kid
ABC, 123, Do-re-mi, out of key
(you got that right)
Out of touch, out of tune, butterknife, tea spoon
(now what was that)
Razz-a-matazz, Thing-a-majig, whatchamacallit, bullshit
So and so, such and such (bullshit!) pretty much
(I think I'm gonna throw up)

[Hook]
Makes no sense at all
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah blah blah)
Makes no sense at all (blah blah)

[Verse 2]
1 and 1 makes 2, 2 and 2 makes 4, 4 and 4 makes 8 and 8 makes 16
16 and, 16 makes (32 Percival)
Ahh makes no sense at all
Who needs lyrics anyway (ummm... YOU!)
