So how do you figure that Atlanta don't be pullin dem triggas?
I'm pissin' up on Jeffrey's Dahmer grave, that cracker was foul
Too close for comfort, too close to home
Too close to be playin' your boy, so hey, why don't you get your own?
Deep in the Dungeon
Amongst the Dungeon Dragon as we pass around dem blunts
Had to cut it out like shears, but for years I used to burn 'em
Gettin deep off in my thoughts just to get shit off my sternum
chess, I never played but made many a moves
look at me, W-M-B backwards
I'm packing my screwdriver so see I'm gon' be alright
Just moving the steering wheel side to side like a slalom
Now I ain't got no problem, I'm just breaking the steering column
