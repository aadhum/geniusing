Starts off like a small town marriage
Lovely wife and life, baby carriage
Now all the stars have cars, success of course
But it ends in Hollywood divorce, Hollywood divorce
And I'm a star
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on
I really think they're stealing from us like a sample song
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home
And all I got in return was a darn country song
This whole country wrong
What would you write if you just put a little ice on
And cut your mic on but you don't even write songs
But Hollywood make you spit like a python, I meant Cobra
I'm so not sober
I'm high like a Hollywood
Coffee or soda
you can call me a roller
Hold up, your grill's glistenin'
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different
What's the real sense of it?
Bling bling, I know and did you know
I'm the creator of the term, I just straightened the perm
Ain't let it sit too long, they just makin' it burn
And make a movie of our lifestyle
but they earn
Like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease
And I be's the little nigga, cooler than anti-freeze
Defrost on your window pane
Lil Wayne
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne
don't make me none
So that's why I got a pre-nup
I do
A is for Adamsville
B is Bowen Homes
See
if I give a fuck if you like me you know I don't
If she ain't got a good head on her leave that ho alone
If she do got some good head on her let her sing a song
D is for what I serve, I don't be on no curb
She ain't no junkie neither, I ain't no dope dealer
But she keep coming back three stacks must be some crack
Put that pipe in her lap, she ain't know how to act
Now that I've got your undivided attention I'm
Gonna say this and run under condition one
Promise me you gon' stack, promise me you gon' ball
Promise me you'll invest three fourths of it all
For what? So your kids, kids, kids can have some cheese
'Cause wealth is the word
Rich is round the corner from the curb
Don't like what I write? Shoot me a bird
Antwan Patton and Andr√© Benjamin
Been jammin'
journalists
That's quick to misprint public and private business
Then retract back for deaf ears and think it's dismissed
Just ain't the same gang of nerds on the internet
M&M's with no nuts
Won't show up face-to-face straight bitch made
Like puppies on the nipples of a mutt
Hollywood divorce
All the fresh styles always start off as a good little hood thing
Look at blues, rock, jazz, rap
Not even talkin' about music
Everything else too
By the time it reach Hollywood it's over
But it's cool
We just keep it goin' and make new shit
Take our game, take our name
Give us a little fame
And then they kick us to the curb that's a cold thang
