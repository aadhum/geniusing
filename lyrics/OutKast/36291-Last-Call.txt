Tell them niggas that be holdin' the wall: (FUCK Y'ALL!!)
Hit the flow start shakin' it all (YES Y'ALL)
What we drinking, no we drinking it all (EH)
We gon do it 'til we can't or we fall
Last call
dub
chicken head friend
Hateville
I'm gon' get that fresh-fly fade and then I'm gon' get laid
Making a early morning serenade for you to start your day
Or the sound of a starter pistol fired close to where you lay
Last call for alcohol, make a fast call for the hay
Closet like the Wild Kingdom: fox, minks, and crocodiles
Anybody ever told you you look like a model?
You know the story, she bit the hook, line, and follow
Got my hooks in the back and I'm a grind until tomorrow
Me cold reptilian feet, bite them hoes
I'm so pimp it's ridiculous
Mello Capone, Don Huggy Bear
