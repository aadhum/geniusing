[Verse 1: Killer Mike]
Our shit don't mix like yay and lukewarm water
Better make it hotter splash ice and watch it rock up
I oughta duct tape your infant daughter
Show soldier ass niggas
I'm murder city's Sargeant Slaughter
Guaranteed to get more cut than a barber
I betcha I'll drill your heifer like Black & Decker
The pussy wrecker and White Water couldn't get it wetter
I'm guaranteed to never swiss cheese for more cheddar
I give a fuck, suede bucks and Coogi sweaters
What's up? Whatever sable fur to lamb leather
Nigga know I, FedEx my shit, overnight express my shit
Deliver my hits quick, who next on my shit list
Banana niggas need to split
Quit fucking with this thorough Atlanta clique
My pen and pixel make violence more graphic
I take raw coke, cook it crack, saran wrap it
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
One muthafuckin' verse and already it's a classic
Killer Mike, nigga!
My Cadillac got that boom, boom in it, listen to it drop
Like cereal in your breakfast bowl just jumpin' off the top
A nigga don't stop for squares or octagons prepare
Nigga you pop lock, for pop rocks, but I'm only poppin tweeters
I'mma eat up anybody who tests this, I'm blessed wit'
Super human powers, poke your chest in,
Nigga you stuck like a truck in red dirt,
you's in church
And I'm the deacon speakin' while ya tweakin'
The preacher preachin', reachin', teachin'
Speakin', being,
breathin'
You're not, your clock stop, and now you're laying in a pretty box
And now pastor is only talking 'bout the pretty parts of your life
Your brother fuckin' your damn wife
You look for the pearly white gates, but you realize your fate
It's too late, cause you hate, you hate
It's too late, cause you hate
Roll my blunts thick, like I like my bitch
Lick my blunts and spit, like she do my dick
Attempted murder dick, for ways I choke chicks
Spit it in her eye make it hard to focus
Big Boi, my mentor, hear what you hollering about
But fuck that, I'm looking for love all in her mouth
Need her to gobble up jism, like school lunches
Need her to take cat beatings and throw punches
Like a swarm of locusts, no hocus-pocus
You wanna approach us, buzzards and vultures
We two of the dopest mic controllers
Stack big bank, honey folders
Even loving, lavish, ladies, leaving, landmarks
Of Lemon-lime, lip gloss on your lavender lapels
Leaping lizards
