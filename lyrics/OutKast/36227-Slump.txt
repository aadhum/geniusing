I'm wit whateva like Wheatstraw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over now that's mo' money to get
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin (fuck him)
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin
Cause life is like shakin the dice
Like five-deuce, fo'-trey, okay
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
Shit, cops and robbers niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin you ain't knowin how much money YOU spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you cause you be buyin all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin everybody, smokin em out
When you was broke though they was missin
Now you ridin bout fo' deep, startin to tear up your suspension
And your baby mamma on child support, my fault, forget to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale
Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy, three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah..
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
[Verse 3: Cool Breeze]
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talking cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothing that ain't been done before
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'mma take some of this money, go and give some back
Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, knowmsayin?
And start thinking bout a path to pave
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
Get to the money and the sweet spot
And forever hollering "Hootie Hoo!" when we see cops
