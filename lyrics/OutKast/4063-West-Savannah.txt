February 1st, 1975 it happened
Was born in West Savannah way before I started rappin
My mamma had a nigga at the age of fifteen
My daddy was sellin that sack, now he's gots responsibilities
Stayed at me granny's while me mammy was at work
And she couldn't watch my every move so shit I started servin
Around Frazier Home, down in the West Side projects
Changin over foodstamps, and hittin a lick was next see
I'm just a playa like that, my jeans was sharply creased
I got a fresh white t-shirt and my cap is slightly pointed East
So flyin, or floatin, a Brougham is what I'm sportin
Sade is in my tape deck
I'm movin in slow motion boi
I'm slightly slouched, in the seats off in my bucket
But the niggas around the Ave. and the hoes, they love me
They wanna be me and my family too
Because the money that I make be puttin cable off in every room
And if you comin with eight dollars, you shit out of luck
Because the West Side ain't takin no shorts on the dime
So fire it up
[Hook-Outkast]
Now now now nine in my hand,
ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
Been wearin furry Kangol's, so that shit is old
Cause the niggas in the Point ain't changed, main
You might call us country, but we's only Southern
And I don't give a fuck, P-Funk spot to spark another
[Hook-Outkast]
Now now now nine in my hand,
ounce in my crotch
Diggin the scene with a gangsta slouch, mmmmhmmmm!
