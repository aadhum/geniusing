Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Good doesn't come without pain
Start over again
Everything happens for a reason
Ain't it funny how you're born and then your life begins
Just like a baby all alone, that's if you wasn't a twin
You must begin to fend for self when the umbilical's cut
The doctor put you under the heating lamp, your spirit is touched
You know what, I take that back, why? You was alive
Date of conception, interception cause the sperm did collide
From T 'n A to DNA, feelings turn to children
But parents got to parent their kids to keep them out of cages
Cell therapists beware of this lugie that I spit
Incarceration without rehabilitation really don't mean shit
Uncle Darnell
Ol' Dirty Bastard
Try to catch up with massah
Ephesians 6:12
so throw that whole armor of righteousness
I spark this thang, but my name ain't Bubba
I got a problem with racist cab drivers, like Glover
I awaken to sunlight that's beyond bright
This day will be done right
Can't live forever, so have some fun, right
Life's a bowl of candy, you can have one, right
