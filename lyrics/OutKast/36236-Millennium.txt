Me and everything around me, is unstable like Chernobyl
Ready to go at any moment, jumping like a pogo stick
Life never lived up to my expectations, so I accept the patience
Expect the worse but now I'm pacing
Inside I'm melting like water on wicked witches
A monster truck done came and ran over my picket fences
I had the best of life in my clenches, but monkey wrenches was thrown
Like chairs kings sit on
my prayers seem to long
I fall asleep before the ending, don't even get to say Amen
I hope He understand I be on bended knees
At times, I think I'm crazy, then I say forget it
Or maybe it's the devil infiltrating and
like Riddick...Bowe
I've been fighting this since them fetus days
I count from one to twenty, when I'm through, repeat the phrase
It's just a phase, it's gon all pass, but that gets old too
I'm weakening like a deacon doing dirt
What am I supposed to do?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh uh, uh uh uh uh uh
See, from bedknobs to broomsticks
I'm writing this rhyme in faith, so when you hear it, hope you true it
My nigga, you do it like swooshes
the lyrical cleanse and new sense
Wiping away your germs and filling your cranium with juices
Straight from west Savannah, Georgia, but the S.W.A.T.S. is my home
Never go wrong cause the click is tighter than gnat ass and that bad
Mosquito,
"I'm proud of you peoples
For selling your crack in sacks, I'm glad I'm white not Black"
Shit, on the real, that's how them whiteys really act
You looking me in my eye, but you ain't feeling me in your heart
These niggas, they leaving me stranded like Rapunzel in the tower
Now or never, let's stick together and overcome
But they don't feel like marching, cause they shoes is overrun
Ain't that a bitch
Planets and stars
Earth, Jupiter, Mars
Hoes, clothes, cars
It's who you are
