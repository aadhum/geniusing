[Intro: Andre 3000]
[Hook]
Find a way to get out, without a hit out
You dig in, you dig out, you get out
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Find a way to get in, to fit in
You get on, you get out without a doubt
Ghetto Musick, Ghetto Musick
Climbing out this hole, with a frown on my face
In the place to be, and not to be at the same time
G-H-E-T-T-O M-U-S-I-C-K stay down
O-U-T-K-A-S-T best know that we won't play 'round
If it don't stank like they stank then they can't swallow that down
Your battleship is sunk,
[Bridge]
I just want you to know, how I feel
(Feeling good, feeling great
Feeling great, feeling good, how are you?)
Hot tub add to the bony, I'm Tony
Edna Mae Kearse,
How to be the smooth operator, dominator
In the state of Georgia,
Leave a mothafucka open like a foyer
dirty,
A lawyer couldn't object or disrespect, the technique
Sweat me, wipe off the sweat
Fight off the shit and flush the waste down
The pipes of my life flow deep into the ground
Campaign in vain for the same lame fame
You obtain,
you ought to be detained
By the hip hop sheriff, locked up
No possibility of getting out cause the shit you make is killing me
We disappear, then reappear again in a fresh new light
