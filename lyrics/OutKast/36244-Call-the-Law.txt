Zora and Rooster under peachtree
They K-I-SS-I-N-G
Wow first came he love
Now then comes the marriage
1-1-1 baby 2 baby 3 baby carriage baby
I'm quite sweet
If you take the time to get to know me
We're tight rope walking and the world's the wire
die
Change it all you turned my spring to fall
We was only in our teens our dreams were simplistic
Jumped the broom but it seems I tripped I must have slipped
