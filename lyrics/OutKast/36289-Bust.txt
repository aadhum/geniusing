Ghosts and goblins
The seventh sign!
Wars, wars
Step into the realms of space where nobody goes
Only the baddest motherfuckers are the ones that are chose!
Some of the coolest individuals on the planet we said
buck
You a Chucky Cheese bouncer chumpin' off the boss
What I'm trying to tell you now is that you're softer than soft
And I'm sick as a cough, did I mention it's raw?
Your predicaments flaw
We lock down traps, push caps galore
My wiz cook work 'til it scale like fish
My old earth even known to handle biz
serve whipped
out of whips
Usually keep a G-pack on the dash
I'm as slick as Freeway Rick and Nicholas Barnes
Uptown Nikes
cheddar
My waistline hold a 4-pound Baretta
I'll shoelace your face just to learn you better
ock
I mastered the music that was born in the Bronx!
I'm still all coast my coast the South!!!
