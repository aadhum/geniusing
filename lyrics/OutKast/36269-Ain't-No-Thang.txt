[Intro: Andr√© 3000]
Niggas in the point ain't changed
Y'all hear my shit go, it's Andre
Can yo punk ass come out to play
Stay in your little hole, then coward duck your head
You don't know who you be fucking with you'se better off, dead
Is what I say, best run the other way
In case of physical breakdown, y'all can break now
My kitchen full of heat, if you can't take the temp
Make yourself exempt
Pussy footing around don't be getting y'all nowhere but stuck
They got the nerve to ask me why I do the things I do
I got the nerve to serve you up just like a waiter do
As long as Big Boi's still living, never standing by my lonesome
Ain't no thang but a chicken wang
We having a smoke out in the Dungeon with the Mary Jane
(East Point)
It's all about that cess in yo chest (it's the joint)
Well nigga, you softer than silicone, used to pump up tits
It's that nigga down in the Dungeon with them playeristic hits
I'm quick to stop a sucka flow like menopause at 50
I used to sell dope, but in 1994
I'm making Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik
But see these voices in my skull has got me reminiscing
About the days back when me mammy had to work in kitchens
She had me making better grades to make a better life
But I never had no love or respect, cause we's gon' be alright
I ran the streets and broke my curfew cause I gave a shit
I carried guns and butcher knives cause I was steadily in the mix
Yeah, it was so hard to say goodbye, I'm a man now
I'm at the end of my street, so it's time to take my stand now
I call the wild because it's time to take the streets
So if you ain't got the vertebrae or big enough nuts, retreat
I'm ready to wet 'em up like cereal
Just an international playa, coming through your stereo
3-5-7 to your forehead
There'll be mo' dead
cause I'm a pro, kid
But Lord forgive me, I gots to keep my Milli right Vi-near me
Don't got no neighbors, they hit the pipe and never let go
But I feel for them like Chaka Khan feel for you
Ain't shit that we can do but rest in peace,
pour a brew
On the concrete
remember when we ran deep
Tripping with that drama, my Beretta's right beside me
One is in the air and one is the chamber
Y'all ask me what the fuck I'm doing, I'm releasing anger
I got the fattest dimes around my way
You can sway with Andre, I'll take it to the Ho-Jo, bitch
Just let you know, yeah
It's on my friend, on the road again, I'm traveling
Do more than 65 on 85 off in my Cadillac
I got that nigga Dre, he riding shotgun
And got my pump under my seat
In case these youngsters wanna have some fun
I'd do it if I have to, busting caps with this a heater
Load it clip up after clip, I'm packing my gauge, if I feel it
The Glock, the gat, the nine, the heaters
See I be busting caps like my amp be busting speakers
So how do you figure that Big Boi be scared to blast you
You 'posed to be quickest draw, but man, I hail 'em faster
1-2-3, you need to think about the future
Before I shoot your ass and dilute your blood with lead
From my hollow tips, I'll send you to an early grave
To take me out, is truly something difficult
Don't even run up on me, unless you want your brain broke
I'm out of bullets letting loose my last clip
I'ma kick you in your ass and your nigga getting pistol whipped
Yeah and it don't stop and it don't quit, to the motherfucking
Organized Noize, PA, Goodie Mob, Big Gipp and all the niggas
Around the East Point way
College Park is really on the map
We coming around Atlanta and the niggas are really strapped
With the mothafucking guns and the motherfucking Glocks
The heaters, the gats nigga, don't fear it and it don't stop
