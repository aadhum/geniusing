Yessuh, let me dig into your brain, folks falling like rain
Poverty got me selling thangs
Jane is rolled up, no gangs be throwed up
But still Andre got action, they Sweat like Keith, all on my teeth
I'm crumbling, no time for fumbling selling my sacks watching my back
Wetting 'em up like splish, leaving 'em in a splash
Of blood,
the clock is ticking niggas from my block is missing
I'm putting it down like it be hot before we all get shot
Got, only so much time in this bastard
Bitter be claiming pro but I be saying they procrastinating
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Grab a pint of golden whiskey
then they swing but shit they missed me huh
You heard me on the radio and yes my man I'm true to dat
And shoot my dice against the bricks the way I wanna flicks 'em
Nigga, so ring around the roses
Ten millimeters, count 'em nigga, fuck a nine
See I added a millimeter for y'all niggas doing crimes and drive-bys
Kiss yo' ass bye-bye, sayonara suckers
I flipped the script and turned the page ain't scared of you motherfuckers
Be popping shots, like them hoes be popping coochies
And I still be spreading bullets like them freaks be spreading cooties
So look here niggas, I'm hunting Red October
There's only so much time left in this crazy world
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand (that's the master plan)
I'm just crumblin' erb, I'm just crumblin' erb
Got a Tampa Nugget blunt box, it's empty
That's where the erb be dropping, it's simply marvelous time is ticking
But some of that time when I be laying vocals in the Dungeon
Sugar Bear and Mone be smoking ounces like it ain't nothing
It ain't shit, to take another hit so hit it
Of the cannabis sativa weed reefer yeah smoke shit
We, is gonna smoke out, until we choke out
Nothing but King Shit, I am asking, sucka can you hang
That player with the pepper throwing salt off in your game
That southern cess be in my chest until I'm chilling in peace, yeah
Niggas killing niggas they don't understand
Coming in like two fat hoes sitting off on Corn Flakes
Big Gipp, Goodie Mob, P.A., OutKast
The J-O-I,
