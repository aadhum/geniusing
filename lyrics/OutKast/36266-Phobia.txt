The feeling of being 12 years old and waking up in the middle
Of the night and somebody in yo room
Many of us mistake phobia for true fear
Whereas fear is a gift from God to be used for self-preservation
Phobia are obstacles strategically placed in society by opposers of positive existence
Through stereotyping, innuendo, false documentation, and glorification, they'll turn your fear switch to a permanent on We can change this by changing the small truth within the lie
Death is a small price to pay for respect
Death is a small price to pay for respect
You know who it is; you know what it is
Peace out
Don't be looking for trouble, it be finding me
Try turning the other cheek
I understand but never mind that
Yes sir, guess the light is getting dim
At the end of the tunnel tried to hit me for my rims
See, living up in the Dungeon where we stayed in '93
