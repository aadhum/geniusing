This one for scooby, pass the doobie I'mma do me one, do me one
I pick up the mic and rock it while I'm sober
For the rated G exposure if you listen what I'm tryin to told ya
Shaggy wake up, we've been had
I suspect the thirteen ghosts of Scoobie Doo
Call Vincent Price up on the Nextel
The hound's only found when you feed him
In fact he probably got my sack
I coulda got away with it, if it wasn't for ya meddlin kids
