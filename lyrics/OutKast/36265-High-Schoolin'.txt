Been always told to keep my head up
But cliches just don't cut the cake when your neck tired from bobbing
My growth, why vote for president if he a spot guy
That's like choosing which bullet you gon' get shot by
A drank and some hot fries
Slowly eating me up from inside to outside
Stay underground like Cheers or Dig Dug
Once was the nigga in the back of the class who never said nothing
Got issues on my mind like a fool from Columbine
Will I swallow my pride or take that ride?
I'm a third year freshman, I started with the best of them
But now them niggas done passed me, I'm just a baby daddy
