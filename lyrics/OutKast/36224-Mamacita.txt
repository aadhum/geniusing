Mahogany Team Queens up on the rise
Be careful, watch your back, blackbirds don't wear disguise
I'm from the Bricks
we get kicks, offa loud gun shot licks
This life is plus I be the bill-be-board, Scarface want
Italiano, I'm the real McCoy, nigga what?
[Hook: Masada + Rico Wade]
Mamacita,
papadonna
[Verse 2: Andr√© 3000]
Yo, now, you and your nigga shit shaky
And at the time your heart feel down and broke like Achy Breaky
[Verse 3: WitchDoctor]
Que pasa, que pasa?
On the balcony, I got a sofa
Nights like this is perfect, for this Spanish Fly
I got your favorite Stouffer's, lasagna, that's how much
I want ya, fuck flowers
Mamacita, papadonna
Better get in where you fit in cause it's crucial
I mean that
The first that look my way just gon' get splack packed
From the front to the back
Everybody cheesin, knowin these hoes gon' cut like Pleasers
These hookers they praisin my crew
Like Reverend Hodo be praisin Jesus
She thought we was some motherfuckin genies
Mira mira
