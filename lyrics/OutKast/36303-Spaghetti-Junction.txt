Yeah yeah, yes Spaghetti Junction, yes yes
Niggas elope wit ski slopes and fall like avalanches
Tootin like it's cool bein a fool,
and I can't just
Sit around and watch those nose membranes flame
My ends is loose and you can't stop that rain
When it starts to fall
Lookin like Ms. Pac-Man
hammers and Vogues
The nigga the B-I-G is high and fly like ValuJet
Black man, white man, Jew man ain't no joke
Remember me and my cousin used to sit up on the porch
And talk about when we get older now we up against the ropes
Yeah they kickin niggas door down; cause it ain't no dope on the streets
And a quarter pound of feet weed, that's all a nigga like me need
Talkin about that Southern sess
nigga you all up in that mess
But never shall you test, and never shall you quit
Runnin up on me with that fuck shit will get you nothin but dead nigga
Be careful where you roam cause you might not make it home
{*whispered*} In the junction, in the junction
Don't you dare ever get lost cause you get caught up in that sauce
A-well I'm drankin on yak while I'm dippin off in that 'llac ('llac)
The junkies around my way are always smokin up on that crack
Be layin them College Park hoes flat on they backs (backs)
Livin the life of pimps steadily makin this paper stack
Niggas don't understand the master plan, crumble yo' herb man
'til they start kickin the do' in, then we ready to blast dem
Out (Out) like 'Kast ('Kast) we bout, to crash (crash)
So mayday, may Dre, knock 'em up off they ass boi
We struggle like fat hoes just to get things that those
People got we forgot they always gonna keep a plot
Right up they sleeve
you won't believe they deceive like weave
See, blindfolds can't cover three eyes
We wise to the fact so we attack with what we know
Heaven is the only good life, so what you strivin fo'? Yeah
Well like flip-flops and football socks
A nigga be rockin the mic like birthdays
Lil' Jon and Ser-cy, so are you wor-thy?
I'm callin yo' ass a flawed pimp
Yappin about this crew you run wit
Bankhead bouncin to that dumb shit
Yes, they can bite, but cannot be us
They can come and pick up little slang but cannot see us
You ought to be ashamed, trying to fit in "My Adidas"
So Run like D.M.C. is me
and no, don't got no heater
Well we zippin around the corner in that golden stankin Lincoln
I got my heat up under my seat
Just in case these youngsters tryin to take it
Pullin the pistol on another black man was never the plot
But sometimes my brothers lose theyself and try to take my spot
Well, they come like black stallions in the night
Usually around fo' or five, is when they figure the time is right
When you good and sleep, I couldn't sleep until I seen it
Wit my own eyes, 'til they come over the hill - surprised
