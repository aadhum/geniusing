Well it is I, the pimp playing nigga that you heard about
Yeah, I got the money and a half a million dope houses
I buy amps that pops my trunk swift
I've been a player since the age of two
That's when I learned to walk, grab my crotch, talk
Do how them hustlers do
See born and raised as a pimp, that's what I claim to be
I pledge allegiance to the streets, that's where I growed up
And make my money cause my daddy never showed up
But fuck it, I'm on my own, I'm in my zone
And nothing wrong, you don't belong, you left me standing alone
So Dolemite, Dolemite not shit, I studied the Mack and Rudy Ray Moore
They were my idols when I was a kid
From nappy head, greasy face, eating watermelon
To drug dealer, armed robber, now convicted felon
I wonder how you would be actin' if you was in my shoes
I put in work and did the dirt, that's how I payed my dues
Uh, 1-2-3, that's how it be
So all the real niggas step up like the playas that's in back of me
Oh heavenly Father, why do you even bother watching over me
Growing up a little G, my mama thought I'd grow to be
A lawyer or a doctor but I felt like coming harder
Packed a shank up in my socks when I started kindergarten
This ain't no secret garden, so you flower niggas flee
If it is one of my own, I'm letting the trigger be
Cause I got love for any nigga who got love for me
And then I get a slap of dap when niggas slanging quarter keys
I ain't forgot about y'all women who be working Nikki's butt naked
At Magic City, shaking titties just to pay the rent
I think about payback, strap myself and keep on danking
If you cross my path, I'll leave you draining like a fountain
Yes it's been like that since way back, in 1975
So little batty bwoy better say your prayers
You better learn some street sense before somebody lay ya
