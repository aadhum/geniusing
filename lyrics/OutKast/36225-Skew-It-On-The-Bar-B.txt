Old school players to new school fools
'Kast keep it jumping like kangaroos
But skew it on the barbie, we ain't tryin to lose
Say, "I be got, damn it, they done changed the rules"
The common denominator, the nigga numerator
I'm sorry, like Atari, who's the cousin to Coleco Vision
Caught a RICO, back on the street like Chico DeBarge
He large and got a 'llac in the garage
Few parts here and there, I declare hard, my lord
One at Clark, one at Spelman
Both know each other, and it's cool,
you can tell when
He step off in the party, women jump for joy
But all the wild niggas scheming, they gon' jump the boy
For spittin' all that bourgeoiseâ€”"My watch, my car"
I'm a star, I'd rather be a comet by far, rrah!
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
ghetto mafioso
Grow hydro, then bag it up slow
Price that, longevity suggest make moves slow
Take time, grow eight, react nine, blow!
Hydro slide raw like fuck Ronaldo
Fly ride though, shit lookin wild dope
Watch five-oh
[Verse 3: Big Boi]
Boi, I bust raps like D-boys bust gats, shit
We the type of people that don't bury the axe
Or the hatchet
everytime we see your link we snatch it
I been in the game for a minute, seen some suckas like y'all passin
Thinkin' you're light skinned, aight then, lil' boy why you frightened?
The Dungeon Family gon' be here nigga so keep writing
I gotta hit The Source, I need my other half a mic
Because that Southerplayalisticadillacmuzik was a classic, right!
College Park, East Point and Decatur they got my back, so
We gon' keep on jammin and stabbin off in the track, ahh
Think it's time to bungee but buddy we will be back
And I'm fin' to put some D's on the 'Llac, know dat!
