Whether you like it or not, he's back
D-A-double D-Y Fat Sacks
The game done changed
Outkast came to heat it up)
And everybody wanna know whats really goin' on
Is you and 3000 still makin' songs?
My heart is like a marching band
I'm a fan in the stands
Yes I am and I'm hollerin' hey baby
My heart is like a marching band
Two dope boyz in the Cadillac still
'Kast ... the crown on ya Cadillac Seville
I'll make your wheels of steel stand (still)
Like your DJ got killed
The fire marsh-
Fire marshall
Shut her down, time to go!
OutKast royalty by design of logo
Wanna count it out loud?
93, 94, 95, 96
Plus a dime, still that's fire
Hot like the perm on the back of your neck
Left it in too long
Now ya got Cabbage Patch silky
Exotic, melodic melody yep, we got it
Fuckin' for the funk of it and everybody want it
Baby you and me
We make a musical masterpiece
I travel the land
Me and the band
