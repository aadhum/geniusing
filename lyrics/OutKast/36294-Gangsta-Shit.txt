Some of that uh, LTD Lincoln Town Car
Some of that El Dorado funk, know what I'm talking about
You know we keep it crunk around here, A-town style
Getting head on the highways yeah
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
O-U-T-K-A-S-T, O-N-P, G-Double O-D-I-E
so fresh so clean
Back with Stankonia
Dungeon Family-ee
vogues
It's the return of Billy Ocean
Cuervo is my drink
Stank, stank means you got the funkiest, dopest heat on the street
Ya girl gonna give you grief at home
Just tell her these hoes wanna be on the same team that she's laying on
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Dope boys in the trap like to stack the dough
When beef come around can't let it go
When my funds turn legit I'm gonna let you know
Ridin rims real good down Old National
it's natural
Puttin cheese in ya stash,
un-taxable futhermuckers get mad
Steady watching myself, got eyes in my back
Don't take no slack, when you managing the trap
If you work out, gotta get it right back
I trap by day boy, rap by night
C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
No colors or rags, just guns and masks
We not scared to blast and dip off fast
With the Dungeon clique, just pulled a lick
Now what you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Back on the scene, a sack of green sitting on chrome and rubber bands
Paint looking like Candyland
it's Slimm the South Paw triggerman
Pimps are known for catching runaways
A good hustler's known to keep his gun away
First nigga run up and try to jack mine
First nigga fuck up to get flat lined
the trunk be  bangin
y'all know that I'm from C.P
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Do you really wanna know about some gangsta shit
Outkast, Goodie Mob and the Dungeon clique
Outkast wit a K, yeah them niggas are hard
Harder than a nigga trying to impress God
We'll pull your're whole deck, fuck pulling your card
And still take my guitar and take a walk in the park
Any play the sweetest melody the street ever heard
Now bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs
Pop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat
As if pitbulls went out of style,
It's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop
Wrong reason
All y'all fuck boys, tuck toys inside your pants
Just to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance
Now what that be for, you're on that reefer and on that 2Pac
trying to show out, that's the ho route
