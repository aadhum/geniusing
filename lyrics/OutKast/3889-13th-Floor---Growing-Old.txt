[Intro: Big Rube]
Conceive true deception multiplied a million fold
Visualize the yin and yang in a battle so intense
That we get em confused
The resident evil specialize in misconstruing
We wanna be at a presidential level -- what are we doin'
Fooling ourselves, clowning ourselves, playing ourselves
By not being ourselves
We can't babble no more than we can bob our head offbeat
Nimrod by the time we forty cause we can't get off meat
While we ask no reason for the misplacement of the season
Tainted as the mind who's blinded to the point
Where Sodomites get all the rights
We fall for fights with fisticuffs
Get pissed enough to miss the bus
I say stand up on deception of time all of Revelations
Jesus and his twelve disciples make thirteen
A righteous number of righteous men
Even Judas the Betrayer came true in the end
They teach that we were the product of incest
Paganomics
Stand with us and don't look back upon it
Just face this mindstate
Otherwise Babylon
"Ninety-six gonna be that year"...
[Verse 1: Andre 3000]
I bet you never heard of a playa with no game
Told the truth to get what I want, but shot it with no shame
Take this music dead serious while others entertain
I see they're making their paper so I guess I can't complain
Or can I? I feel they're disrespecting the whole thang
Them hooks like selling dope to black folks
And I choke when the food they serving ain't tasting right
My stomach can't digest it even when I bless it
I'm confessing one more lesson from the South, we in the house tonight
Now hootie who wants to oppose? Suppose
We rolls through Headland and Delowe
Where me and my niggas would pass the flow
And got down for ours like hind catchers
My mind catches flashbacks to the black past
While mind close niggas laugh at
The Southern slang, finger waves and Mojo chicken wangs
I grew up on booty shake we did not know no better thang
So go 'head and, diss it, while real hop-hippers listen
Started by Afrika Bambaata
Looks like breezes of Autumn done finally blew my way
Like memories of yesterday
Uhh, born Antwan Patton but my partners they call me Big Boi
It's the nigga the B-I-G, be speaking the truth not talking that shit boy
I'm thinking of checking my traps and busting my raps
And throwing them craps
7 Eleven is no convenience, you pumping your gas but watching your back
For the robbing crew; thinking they're robbing you, you must be cautious
To staying up on your game and pimping these crows, you must be flawless
Like Mortal Kombat,
but fucking these wombats got you dizzy
My nigga you know if I wanna be playin
But runnin up on me like you miss me
You catching the wrong vibe
As we bust, us, we leavin em in the dust
So keep that caine up out of your nose
Dearly beloved we are gathered like soap is to lather we come clean
Some issues need to be addressed like envelopes I mean
Oh, like Liberty Bells, yes them bullets keep on ringing
On fire like the Georgia mass choir we keep on sanging
Bringing our folks closer together cause they severed us from the get green
Light and we ain't gon' stop until we hit the big screen
Psych, because no one is free when others are oppressed
So, we hit the stage and then we fly back to our nest
Growing old
Like some eagles
people don't understand
Just like their parents don't be caring
I'm speaking bout you playing with that phony stuff you sharing
In your raps Mercedes Benz and all your riches
Cause you fall in; falling like leaves into driveways
Isn't it lovely smoking good and sloppy head on highways
Fridays are tight but Saturday just makes it old
Winter nights are hot warm enough to feed your soul
Growing old
See all them leaves must fall down, growing old
Fat titties turn to teardrops as fat ass turns to flab
Sores that was open wounds eventually turn to scab
Trees bright and green turn yellow brown
Autumn caught em, see all them leaves must fall down, growin' old
