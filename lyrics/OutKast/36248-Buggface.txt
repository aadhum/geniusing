"Can I dance?" {*echoes*}
But the train is in reverse and the caboose is in the center
Cause ya mind ain't free
Bro, Bra, bruh, Brother, Bro-ham
Cadillac on vogues, strike a pose, then the door slam
When I'm left alone, I get to thinkin to myself
The mind is a terrible thing to waste, so use it 'til none left
Like the O.U.T.K.A.S. clearly nigga you know the rest
