Man, have you ever really wondered
Like why are we here? What the meanin to all of this?
My life is goin downhill like some cardboard in the snow
Feel like the figure four leglock
And expect to be as pure as an infant in the beginnin
[Interlude]
But what about repentance?
What about the tension?
What about you eating dinner in the devil's kitchen?
But what about repentance?
What about committing the same sin
Over and over again and again and ah..
Life, is nothin but a dream, so peaceful and serene
Well I receive what you want to believe
But soon you'll have to sew those bad seeds
Whatever should you fumble your rebuttal should be subtle
