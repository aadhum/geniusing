Straight from the A-T
Athletes want to be rappers, shawty, trust me
Bending corners in the Benz
Ridin like a bucket, nigga fuck it
I optioned a bitch off like a nigga playin rugby
I done seen a ghetto meal, little buddy, trust me
Jump European, came clean through customs, no questions
Perpetrators in the booth, rappin lame like they drug related
You don't grind, you be lying
Should be castrated, Lorena Bobitt maybe?
Lil' Brotha
You see, I cock back Glocks, got more pull than slang shots
500 Benz
Bust like balloons, who gives a damn if it goes pop
Fuck the cops
I chop you up like Norman Bates
The first verse I ever wrote, I got a Platinum plaque
Get the fuck on the ground
Is just a phrase you might hear strolling through the A-Town
From College Park, Georgia to College Park, Maryland
Catch me with a sack of dro, reaching for The Strap Below
Y'all driving Subarus
Fourth and goal
Should I take the three point field goal for the score or should I roll
Around and take the ball up the middle,the gut, the what, the hole
Cranium overload, overthrowed
Now we got seven more points on the board, fa sho
me oh my, I think He's blessing me
Like Ragu, it's in there
They say "Big Boi, can you pull it off without your nigga Dre"
I say "people, stop the madness cause me and Dre be okay"
We done split it down the middle so you can see both the visions
Been spittin it damn near ten years, why the fuck would be be quittin?
Fuck, nigga
