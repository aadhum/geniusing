Out of the basement
Out of the dungeon
Eric Robert Rudolf
When I was younger songs
Had more fucking meaning (Meaning)
Stankonians activate that part of you that don't mo-ove
Who only plays nines's and tens on the 1 and 2's
Allow me to remove your crew of those Iceburg sweaters
I got a snort habit motherfuckers!!
Leave bitch niggas naked like D'angelo
Michael from Adamsville with a murderous look
