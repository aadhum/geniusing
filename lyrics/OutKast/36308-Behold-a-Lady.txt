Sophistafunk, aristocats
Distinguished dogs, clean up your acts
Pull up your pants
Where do all the good girls go
What clubs they hang in?
Behold a lady
I see you standin' on the wall
Clap, clap... you deserve it all (Repeat)
Candy-coated unicorns are quite hard to find
The classic lady, a rare breed indeed
Is that make and model discontinued?
Today I might snow, tomorrow I'll rain
3000's always changing but you stay the same
And I need that, hey I need that (in my life)
When I feel washed up and inadequate
You're the anchor that holds me down
When my ship is sinking
You won't let me drown and I'm grateful
Yo' mama's old fashioned, yo' daddy don't play
You'll always be this lovely
Cause they raised you that way
Hallelujah! Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
Thank ya Jesus! Thank ya Lord!
You're not extra extra, you're so plain Jane
The ying to my yang, darlin'
You've got that thang and you know it
But yet you don't and that's what's so cool
In the street you hold your head high
At home you get low down for me
Sad, but one day our kids will have to visit museums
To see what a lady looks like
So if you find one, I beg you, hold her tight
If you spot one, good sir, treat her right
Good luck and goodnight
