You see there will always be someone, taller, darker
Maybe wit a little of cheese than I got
But really, shawty you don't need nobody else
Cause baby I am (I am) the opening act (the opening act)
The headliner (the headliner) and the after party
After party, after party, after party, after party
Hey shawty, look here for a minute, shawt, shawt
Oh, my bad, my bad execuse me
You corporate America, you corporate America...
I meant to say lil' lady, you look so lovely lying in wait
Like a lemon licorice, lollypop
Waiting to be licked, we don't play
But you think the shit
Was that too harsh for you lobes
Too heavy for your mentality I suppose
Like a D-Boy movin' fifty P's of that work
From A-Town to Dallas movin' cool
