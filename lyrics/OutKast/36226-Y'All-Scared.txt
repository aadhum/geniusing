Piece by piece, this puzzle comes together
And really don't give a fuck bout what you doin
Long as I pave the way
For my SouthWest GA warriors
To come in packs, to feed, takin what we need
To succeed
In this world I'm Gipp, in second the mutant
The third the Geechee, how many ways can you reach me?
Others flew sky high, while others were duds
Live high up on the hills, to escape the floods
Give a FUCK what you think, we ain't movin out this spot
And I'm out
[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
Yo, paragraph indent,
I make intense sense
Niggas on that Gil Scott dope (hint hint)
At age fifteen they start smokin' Billy Clint'
Now he's twenty-one and wants to know where the time went
Hey hey hey what's the haps? Well see your time elapsed
Have you ever thought of the meaning of the word trap?
Baboon on your back,
but what's sad is that crack
Was introduced to Hispanic communities and blacks
But then it spread to white and got everyone's undivided attention
Cause your daughter is on it and you can't hide it
Maybe your son tried it, rehab too crowded
You scared, she scared, they scared, I said
They scared they scared to talk about it
Bout it bout it bout it bout it bout it
February 1st, 1975's my birthdate
The player the B-O-I, was brought onto this Earth on Thursday
But if you see me on the Ave, you betta believe I tote that shank
Southernplayalistic ATLiens in your sock drawer
Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning
The intro, the Goodie we kinfolk, nigga it's fin to jump off
But now it's time I lay low
Cause I believe the track gon' cut off
Psych, the track is bumpin' like pussies on some dykes
So if you scared say you scared cause everybody can die tonight
Cause my heart don't pump no Slushee
You touch my niggas you touch me
Heat'll make anything move
Even Tyson, can get laid down, with this tool
Just cause the name say Goodie, you take us for fools
I go off like mines, blowin suckers to smithereens
We was never folks if we fell out over this lil' cream
I don't care how rough you roll, we can't be shut down
Ain't no openin' up shop, we already established
Keep wishin', high heels clickin'
Zap em for the pumpkin, at twelve
Slain dead, devils, don't have enough to purchase my essence
Still standin for somethin while y'all fallin for nothin
We get this shit together our power's in numbers
