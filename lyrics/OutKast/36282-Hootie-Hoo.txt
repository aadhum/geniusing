Hootie Hoo, follow the funk from the skunk
And the dank that is crunk in the Dungeon
I be thinking about the good ol' days when I was a whippersnapper
Used to try to get a kiss, but now it be them draws I'm after
Southernplayalistic
I used to slang a fat rock, but now I'm serving hemp
I never even smoked a gram of crack, but yo I'm dope
Mo' doper than a junkie or a Pookie cause it's on
So each one, teach one, I be claiming true
To East Pointe and College Park and the things I used to do
Club Nikki, Magic City and them Southern playas
One for the playas at the crib, drinking drinks
And two is for the sound, Hootie Hoo that I make
Hootie Hoo
Tight like hallways, smoked out always (Hootie Hoo)
Now playing these bitches is my favorite sport
But ain't no game when they be calling your name in the court
Oh, it's Saturday night, I guess that makes it alright
Got an obese twenty sack, fully packed, it's so tight
That it's busting out the seams, yes sir, I'm set
Oh, but let me tuck the 380 before I jet
Communication device dun went off twice
Should I answer the call, yes, we macking 'em all
We met 'em up in the mall, recall Player's Ball
Draws, falling down like niggas in a drive-by
I got up in them hoes and I told 'em bye bye
About two weeks later, she called me with some bullshit
Talking 'bout her period late, guess what I did
*click* naw, it couldn't be me. Not me
Well you know we getting blizzard
Cause we got that chicken gizzard
So 'lujah, Halle, let me get a swallow of that Martell
And you may go to hell
Set sail with a nigga from ATL, Southwest that is
One mo' 'gain for my friend who don't take
No bullshit from no bitch who is stank
I ain't the sugar daddy nigga who will pay you
Silly of you to think that I would, but I will lay you
Down like some vocals, you can quote those
