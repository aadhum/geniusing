You're all I've ever wanted, but I'm terrified of you
My castle may be haunted
I've cast my spell on millions
Baby I do this from the ceiling,
but I'm terrified of you
I wait my whole life to bite the right one
Then you come along and that freaks me out
So I'm frightened...
I've never ran from no one
See my heartbeat is a slow one
Done my thang across the stage,
You know I'm terrified...
You know I'm terrified...
3,000...3,000...
3,000...3,000...
Don't run, I'm not the sun
So much at stake... oh!
Bad choice of words
But I'm not the gun with silver bullets
And I can count
plus I make great peanut butter
And jelly sandwiches...
Van Helsing
For richer or poorer...
Through sickness and in health...
'til Death do us part...'til DEATH do us part
You only live once...well, not in our case...
Cause we live forever
