As I, struggle to keep my balance and composure
I'm 'posed ta, propose a toast to players on every coast-a
The lyrical roller coaster, mind-bender
'Stead of watchin these sucker MC's
I'm seein just how they lyin to the general population
Don't you agree or understand we lost some rights at 1-1-9?
Come dumb, come young, come blind unwind confined
To the situation, we facin, cause in time, tick tick boom
When will we all, awake up out this dream
Come here and smell the Folgers, the soldiers are human beings
Clockin the souls of men out like he was G-O-D
Politicians, modern day magicians
(chill Big, lay in the cut)
For what? I refuse to sit in the backseat and get handled
Like I do nuttin all day but sit around watch the Cartoon Channel
I rap about, the Presidential election and the scandal
That followed, and we all watched the nation, as it swallowed
And chalked it up, basically America you got FUCKED
The media shucked and jived now we stuck - damn!
Operation Anaconda - ask yourself
Was it full of bleeps and blunders, did they ever find Osama?
And why in the fuck did Daniel Pearl have to pay the price
For his life and his wife plead twice?
See Al-Amin got life and
Fred got dead, Hampton
To dampen the dream of all the Panthers
But it got to, you gave me this microphone so I must rock you
Your brainwaves, airwaves, energized and SHOCKED you
Y'all got me, well I got y'all, long as I know y'all listenin
I'mma always bring food for thought to the table in the kitchen
Now eat nigga!
