People don't you worry bout me
Evil gon get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot you out this lil town
Soon as I do it I'm gon get down
Mama dont you worry bout me
Papa dont you worry bout me
I live a life but it just ain't mine
Know I'm a your son won't you let me shine
Come on, come on
Don't worry bout me I'll be fine
Well that's what I tell 'em but I'm lying
Yall know bout the blues don't you
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues
Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Some call it baby blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gonna play until you feel happy
Till there ain't no more blues
Idlewild
Be there
