Here's a little something for the players out there hustling
Getting down for theirs
From East Point, College Park, Decatur, Da 'Briar
You know, niggas worldwide...
Man, the scene was so thick
Lowriders, '77 Sevilles, El Dogs, nothing but them 'Lacs
All the players, all the hustlers
I'm talking about a black man heaven here
YouknowhatI'msayin? Yeah
All the players came, from far and wide
Wearing afros and braids, kicking them gangsta rides
Now I'm here to tell ya, there's a better day
When the player’s ball is happening, all day e’ryday
