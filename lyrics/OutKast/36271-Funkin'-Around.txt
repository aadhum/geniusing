Hello, well good evening, ladies and gentlemen
What we like to do right here—well first of all, let me let you know who I am
Well, I go by the name of André 3000, right?
You know, right now everybody wants to be from space
Torn between Saturday night and early Sunday morn'
I don't know, I'm somewhere stuck in between-tween
See, we ain't even seen the mountaintop
Counterclockwise goes the neighborhood
You amount to the same thing every day like per diem
Silence before violence
Nine times out of ten times, the quietest is the livest
Fumblin' through your privates
Daddy Fat Sacks, can they have your back?
got me sprawled out
In your black book, my name was crossed out
Reminiscing, the party you was missing
Instead of arguments, you think about the hugs and kisses
