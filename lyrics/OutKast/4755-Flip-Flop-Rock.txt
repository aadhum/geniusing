Yeah... ATLiens style on y'all ass
Young Hov' in the place to be
Andr√© 3000 (cash!) Shout out to public housing, bitch
I brought (holla!) the whole hood with me
You got red dirt in your afro
Young Hov' in the place to be (yeah)
That we drop a little science off in every verse
They put that P.A. sticker on it cause they scared we gon' curse
In the meantime, Daddy Fat Sax gon' chill out
Marcus, Jason, my little brother James
All my brothers from my momma but Andre is just the same
Ain't no uno, we a duo; deuce dos to a pair
A player stiffen the competition
Pressed like Levi's and toughskins,
one minus one
Negative one minus negative one is nothin
Bustin d-boy raps and player poems
The 'Kast shit ain't plastic, we smash it and move the crowd
And rock the crowd original material while you bore 'em
Penelope Ann Cruz couldn't snooze
With her Eyes Wide Shut
before I asked to hit her gut
Take you to Swan Lake and beyond
two thousand leagues below the sea
lead like Commander Picard
You can have "The Whole World"
Or be satisfied with the boulevard, overstand
Like a young Cassius Clay in his prime
I was born to talk shit and prove mine
Aquemini's
monster
fix it up like gin and juice
Dudes wanna know what he copped
And where you got that, and how could they buy that
Where the million dollar watch at, stop that!
Why that, why this, niggas wanna hijack the flyness
I'm on a whole 'nother plane
A whole different lane, a whole 'nother game that I'm playin
Understand what I'm sayin
