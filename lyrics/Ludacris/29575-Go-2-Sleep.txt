Maaan, I tell a ho to go to sleep (go to sleep)
They turn around and frown, gotta make them six feet deep
I got QP's and halves
I had this ho who talked too much; I had to off the bitch
slang
brown
white
yellow
purple
green
Now if you warring and running from the Three Six niggas
This forty-five gon' give a reason to sleep, nigga
Or busting massive rounds from SK
North, north, south, south, Westwood, Orange Mound
Nigga we be smokin' life; never Ch-Ch-Charlie Brown
Memphis niggas in this bitch; pockets full, ya know we bail
Juicy J be high as fuck; catch me in the lost and found
