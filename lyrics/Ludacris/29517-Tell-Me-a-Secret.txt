These other guys be out here talkin but they steady frontin
They don't know what they want, that's why I tell you put yo' trust in me
I ain't gon' tell nobody baby, I'm an only child
I'll keep it to myself cause all I wanna do is see you smile
And I won't judge you cause I know that ain't nobody perfect
But you got some perfect imperfections and that makes you worth it
I wanna see yo' body in all of the positions that you like it in
We could do it slow or have some drinks and it gets enticin when
You like it rough and I give it rough and start to pull yo' hair
Cause ecstasy's yo' destination and I'mma take you there
