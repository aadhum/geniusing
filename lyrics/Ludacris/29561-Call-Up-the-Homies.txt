[Ludacris] + (The Game)
Got scooped up by Game so I hopped up in the Coupe
I'm tryin to ease back and get my head in the zone
(Then where the fuck you tryin to go?)
So fool mash the gas, the night is young
All bullshit aside I'm tryin to have some fun
or ride down Slauson
And let's roll to Roscoe's and grab somethin to eat
Tell me you know this nigga (nah, they better stop playin)
Could be one-time just tryin to bust one of us
Throwin signs out the window like somethin was wrong wit him
Keep one eye open cause the streets don't sleep
(If the streets get hungry then the streets gon' eat)
That's why I keep some heat and a couple of rounds, nigga
Just stepped one size 12 Air Force 1 in the A-Town (ha ha ha)
And this chrome trey-pound got me feelin Atlanta +Brave+ now (right)
Disturbin' Tha Peace, I'll let the lead spray
I'm startin to love this place, they even got Red Clay (okay)
Then it's off to the Waffle House
Yeah, I'm in a real-life movie,
When Luda step foot out in Phoenix, A-Z
Superbowl
I know you kinda used to big booties in the club
But ain't nothin wrong to have a lil' sauce in your blood
My town, but I still got Phoenix enemies (yup)
But it's hard to fight back when you got an album droppin (connects)
Matter fact, Chris, tuck in your Africa chain (what?)
