I'm from the A, I came to party 'til I pass out!
It's Luda Luda get it right I'm Mr. Money Machine
And I'm steady lookin for two women I can come in between
I'm stunt, like Jackie Chan
lay low, like Rebbie Jack-son
And rearrange your frame in one breath
'Tis the season for bleedin and we've been lookin for a reason
My whole car smell like a woodshop class
Let me show you some whips that don't come out 'til the year of 2010
I went diamond with this album so we buckin, we buckin
When I'm pushin 90 by myself up in the H.O.V. lane
Bein one of the few rappers responsible for changin the game
Now desperate artists tryin to sue but they just makin some claims
