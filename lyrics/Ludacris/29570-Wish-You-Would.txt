It was bound to happen sooner or later
History has been made
[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I keep a fresh pair of One's on my feet
and double deuces on the chevy
3's company,
the double 4's on my belly
5 hot amps speakers shake like jelly
So many wires in my trunk look like a bowl of spaghetti
And yeah I went green, and 26's on the hybrid
Smoked so much green that I can't open up my eyelids
Wake up in London, go to sleep on Atlanta time
Still my paint got more candy then your valentine
Bentley Car cover lookin' like a laced frontwig
Of course they hating cause they still riding the MARTA train
Now that's Karma so call me Daddy War Bucks
If you got money, I got more bucks
Custom hood scoops make the coupe look like Pinocchio
I'm rich bitch, I should drop cash
The inside of the Lac' look like a wood shop class
And these women gimme "Love" like it's tennis time
So many shoes that my closet look like Finish Line
So many acres that my crib look like Bermuda
So many diamonds the safe look like Kay Jewelers
That Spider about to drop my team said Luda get it
Now 50 thou says that I'm the first nigga with it
First round draft pick, later for you imbeciles
The car is all black like it got traded to the Timberwolves
And I keep a little bit of that green up in the lining
But as the weather change my weed adjust to different climates
Now it's black with that purp I call my whip the "Sac King"
B-MORE
From it I annihilate suckers in they driveway
In church on sunday morning praying about what happened Friday
But them the consequences for coming at pimpin sideways
Now a days guess it pays to change
I'm balling til I'm bored with selections and assortments
Of automotives worth a small fortune
Of course it's the '72 Chevelle hardtop, '69 drop
60 karat piece you can barely pay your lease
Fuck another car it's time to try an buy a airline
