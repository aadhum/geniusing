[Hook 2X: Nate Dogg]
[Ludacris]
But on my path to see the light sometimes my vision gets blurred
It's all a part of growin up and seein life at it's worst
Then tryin to iron out my wrinkles, puttin family first
It seems like the whole world is out for sinkin my boat
But with God as my navigator I'll be stayin afloat
And I admit to bein caught by many foolish distractions
Then I'm forced to pay the price as the result of my actions
I'm battlin with MYSELF and every DAY it's a war
Curiosity killed the cat, why I'm Curious George?
And just cause somethin looks good don't really mean that it is
Get through the agony and anger, the pain and strife
And take the necessary steps to try to change my life
So why is everything that's bad for me feel so good?
[Ludacris]
Now I'm a only child, so excuse some of my selfish ways
I got spoiled when I was young, spoil myself today
A self-made millionaire, baby look at me now
Cause all I ever really needed was a pen in my hand
Was a young man forced to grow up at the age of 12
