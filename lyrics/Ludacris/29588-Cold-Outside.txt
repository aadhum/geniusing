25 lighters on dressers
It's all about me buying some land
You folks just don't understand
Man, I see the clouds coming
Y'all see a man on the moon walking
I see a crowd running
'Do rag with a gat under my belt
Cause life's throwing strong blows
But I keep a little hope and some dreams
And I try to stay focused and clean
But I got a little dope and some green
