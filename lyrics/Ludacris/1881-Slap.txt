Sipping on a fifth of the Golden Grain
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
I feel like slapping a nigga today (slap slap)
Slapping a nigga today
Slapping a nigga today
This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed (bed)
And I'm thinking bout killing my boss today
Killing my boss today
I'm thinking bout killing my boss today (it's just a thought man)
Killing my boss today (yeah)
Yesterday my best friend died (died)
Have you ever seen a grown man cry?
Even got my 45
When I know that my stereo's taken away?
Gas prices are way too high
Cause President Bush could give a damn about our ass
