I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I wear my sunglasses at night so I can — so I can
I am wearin' my sunglasses, I'm feelin' fantastic
I wear my sunglasses at night-time, never in my right mind
Sippin' on some Golden Grain, but my niggas we call it embalmin' fluid
I'm on that foolish shit, only got one life to live
Right down to their bare-essentials, don't mess wit' 'em on their menstruals
