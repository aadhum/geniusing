Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Let it rush through your veins
cause I'mma be the one
To step up and put a hundred thousand dollars on the game
Got a pocket full of change and they C-note stacks
Bustin' dominoes, spades, cee-lo, craps
We shootin' pool at the Luda-plex
I slap a hundred on the table
Just to see if any fools wanna do it next
Or put your house on the line and I can cover the bet
scared money don't make none!
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Bet a hundred (bet a hundred) bet a thousand (BET A STACK)
Bet a million (put yo' money where yo' mouth is)
Whether it's Madden or it's Live, tell 'em pick up the sticks
catch me out in A.C
Callin' yo' bluff with Puff eatin' cheesecake
So all my ramblers, runners and money scramblers
Put your drinks up to all compulsive gamblers
Cameras eyein' us, sidebetters tryin' us
The more chips we stack, the more drinks they buyin' us
Cause I can drink a fifth of gin and it don't hurt
