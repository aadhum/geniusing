Hey girl how you doin'?
You are the woman that I'm really pursuin'
And I would like to get to know ya, can you gimme ya name?
If you jot down ya number you'll get mine in exchange (heyy)
See I'm the man of this town
And I hope you wouldn't mind
if I showed you around
So when you go to certain places you'll be thinkin of me
We got, people to meet and many places to see (heyy)
Mm, I'm really diggin' ya lips
But be careful where you walkin' when you swingin' them hips
Cause I'm kinda concerned that you'll be causin' a crash
With your traffc jam booty heads pausin' so fast (heyy)
I would'nt trade you for the world I swear it
I like ya hair and every style that you wear it
And how the colors cordinate with your clothes
From your manicured nails to your pedicured toes
Yeah, you hear the song so dance
Don't always think I'm tryna get in your pants
One day we on the Autobahn, swervin drivin
Especially at Wet Willies on Miami Beach
Makin' sure I don't miss the homecoming at Howard
Then at night I'm in New Orleans drinkin' hand grenades
Outnumbered by the dozens at the jazz fest
Til I went to Canada and saw some beautiful hoes
Now I hit the Caribana every year in Toronto
You wouldn't believe your eyes if you went to Brazil
The best women all reside in Africa, and that's real
Outro: Katt Williams
Could we have all the real pimps
Please put both of your pinky fingers high in the air?
Cause it's no way that all these niggas could be pimpin'
With two sweat patches up under his arms
If you smell like you been at work all day and your car
Now look up at the pinky fingers that are still in the air
If you see him ashy around the knuckles
Like the nigga wash half of his hands
And lotion three quarters of his body
If your spinnin' rims spin counter clockwise, you are not pimpin'
If your Vodka and Cranberry is really really dark like blood
That's because you didn't order Vodka buddy
Now look down, look down
I need everybody to pull up your pants leg one time
Okay, you see the nigga with the white socks
Sorry unless you part of the "Beat It" entorauge
