I met this chick in Motor City
And her name was Lexus
Ass out of control
her chest was wreckless
So we exchanged numbers
I just wanted to sex this
Gotta give her the D
some pearls as her necklace
Around seven thirteen like Houston, Texas
She’s everything I hoped for in the bedroom
And like Tyra Banks, I need some headroom
Because she can suck a golf ball through a garden hose
I'm on point at Game time
Y’all be guardin' hoes
Yeah, she never plays games like the Parker bros
And we be drinking Conjure by the cases
Meanwhile your girl’s been exchanging fuck faces
You must be used to all the finer things
Infatuated by what money brings
It seems to me, you hoes'll never change
(Hoes won't ever change..)
As me and my homie sat and discussed paper
so I didn’t leave a tip
I left her an advance
Along with my number saying "give me a call"
And she flew over like a moth thing
fuck face
