Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction
Yeah, blow me a shotgun
B-b-b-blow me a shotgun
B-b-b-blow me a shotgun
It gives me (satisfaction)
808 bang in the back with the woofer like boom boom boom boom
It's different strokes for different folks
Reverend Run is pumpin out children
So catch me on more 24's than Kiefer Sutherland
I'm the one that went to the gunfight with a knife, and won
Snickers bar I give her (satisfaction
Yessir there ain't not other way so motherfuck what you say
Y'all had this spot, we took you off the top like a toupee
Of course we
kick and pushed in
fiasco like Lupe
Back that ass up like Juve
Y'all talk that smack but copycat and do a movie like him
Yessir my mob got that goodie as if my group had a Gipp
That's why my money long as the line at the DMV
Weed what you need, hit me I'mma drop off peaches like I'm T.I
Zip-loc full of dro
Where my cake give me my candles, I got sweet sixteen
got DTP on his necklace
