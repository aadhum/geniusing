[Intro]
That's thirty five thousand dollars cash money
No, that's thirty five thousand plus one right?
The one I gave you?
No, you gave me six though right?
I had one and it was thirty five thousand plus one plus six makes seven
Thirty five thousand dollars and seven right?
Mothafucka can you buy that?
Awww, here this nigga Luda go again talking 'bout how much money he got and shit!
Maserati's, Lamborghini's or a mutherfuckin' Maybach
Lay back making pay stacks
Conjure on the rocks, don't chase that
Buss all in your bitch face, and like Puff, tell her take that, take that!
Keep a bottle of a Veuve Clicquot in a choke hold
I know people mob like no does
All night with the door closed
Women jumpin' on my stick like pogo's
I'm filthy rich, bitch, go spend some mula
I went to the dealership and the Ferrari dude was like errr Luda?
I can buy that shit
No nigga can even deny that shit
Pull up at the light with a hottie in a Bugatti
And whatever you driving you better hide that shit
Yo' money is tied up, bitch my money is the dominatrix
Yo' money's funny, my money's mean
Yo' money's scummy, my money's clean
Yo' money is... stupid
My money is "get over here, finish him. hadouken"
