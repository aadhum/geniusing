[Ludacris]
This goes out to my father, who is in critical condition right now
I appreciate your prayers
Mr. Wayne Bridges
I love you
Rest in peace Wayne Bridges
You're still living through me
I lost my father to the bottle
Cause when he was living I'm thinking how do I get him to listen
When he was seldom in his right mind
My early years I was too young to understand
But I remember the smell of beer and seeing all the empty cans
Waking up, crying in the night, hearing arguments
Hands off my momma, somehow I knew he was the cause of it
Functioning alcoholics what they call it far as I know
Became a teenager and started to understand
But even through drinks he still taught me to be a man
I run the con concerts?
Cause who gon' tell him he can't drink none of his son's liquor
You left the day after I put you into my Grammy speech
It's almost like you waited just to see me win
Well, pops I can't wait until the day we meet again
