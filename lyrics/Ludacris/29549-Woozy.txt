Ludacris can't hide or deny that I wanna get you down to them Vickie Seeecrets
Number one shaker, like Vick's vapor I wanna fuckin ruuuuuub it
They be like "I've been feelin kind of stressed can you blow my back out?"
And I'm like "Yea but don't trip if I happen to yank a track out"
When I get done its smooth sailin once I pull that 'Lac out
Next destination I move forward like Jerry Stackhouse
Slow grind and slow jams while I'm feelin yo booty
We'll hold hand and hold times when I'm up in that coochie
Other girls I give 'em a shoulder colder than Chicago
But in ya center I heat it up in the morning like Alonzo
I stay on islands longer than Gilligan
Sippin on a pina colada,
They just jealous, everybody hates when Cris is rockin ya world
