Welcome to my sex room
Sex room, room, oh, oh, oh
Welcome to my sex room, room
Feelin' high but I'm hung real low, lookin' sorta like a tri-pod
So power down your cell phone, and power up your iPod
Power down your inhibitions, and power up your inner freak
Yes, yeah fuck, is the only words that you finna speak
Damn right I'ma get that thang and I'ma put my name on it
All night I'ma whip that thang, Allstate better put a claim on it
Get ready for blast-off
waterfalls gon' splash off
You might lose around four or five pounds so get ready to sweat your ass off
Let the candles burn, I'ma turn these lights down
My arm underneath your leg, legs all behind your head is how I gots to getcha
Right hand, left hand on red in the bed like we been playin' Twister
Know that I want it, baby yeah
To my sex, to my sex, with your toes pointed
