This industry is like a crack game
Where do I begin
Well, the industry shady not everybody is your friend
I had to learn that shit the hard way
In and out bogus contracts since before i was rapping in the hallway
Everyone out for money, executives out for blood
If you don't keep the music current then labels'll pull the plug (Get it)
While everybody's on Instagram just fronting like life is grand
Lost a bunch of jewelry from a Rolex to a diamond chain (Bitch)
Meanwhile on all my records , nigga talkin' bout he pimpin'
Maybe i exaggerated a lil bit
You know fake it till you make it every one of us rappers gotta talk a little shit
Yeah i done smashed some video vixens and some actresses
But brand name pussy don't feel no different on my matresses
Insecure hoes with breast jobs and butt shots
Blaming on us rich niggas sponsoring shit and what not
Now guys are just as big as groupies as these women is
Till you break up and a bitch wonder where her percentage is
While these regular hoes are trying to play the trap game
And now is the time i blame it on the rap game
Listen , this ain't scripted this reality
It take some drugs for us to conquer this insanity
Thieves using our name promoting these fake appearances
Publicists overcharging taking years for these clearances
I got sued some rappers said i stole their joint nigga
Spend half a million just to prove a fucking point nigga
We got the fans thinking rappers never lose
Gave a producer a hundred grand for a beat i never use (Damn)
The false stories and being misquoted in magazines
Got a nigga wanting to go and load a couple magazines
Head to your office and shoot up the whole fucking staff
Post that on your website and burn while i fucking laugh
You protesters at my concerts y'all make me sick
I thought i told y'all i would never disrespect a bitch
It's clear to see that Hip Hop's under attack man
Or is it cause that no one wants to see a rich black man
Really they want us with no money
Hungover and missing flights and cutting our show money
Hip Hop cops still lurkin' and trying to catch us slippin'
And put us in a position to make some real life decisions (Hmmm)
Or do we just be doing dumb shit
Emptying out these gun clips and always on the run shit
Lifestyles of us entertaining hood niggas
If it's bad to be a rapper what's good nigga
