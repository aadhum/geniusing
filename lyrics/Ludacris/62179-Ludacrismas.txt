Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Eat a little chicken, drink a couple beers
But down below we firing up the barbeque grills
Eggnogs got daddy swerving on the highway
New suits for church and a couple pairs of dress socks
Oh yeah, I hear the sleigh bells ringing and the jingle bells rock
I hear he’s making that list, checking the thing twice
I guess it’s probably cause I been naughty not nice
But I'mma straighten up my act
Get up on track
Make a couple bucks and buy Mama a Cadillac
