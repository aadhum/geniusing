[Intro: Ving Rhames]
He's a hustler, unbound by law
A self-made millionaire
With a wreckless disregard for the haters
A true entrepre-negro
CEO of Disturbing Tha Peace Records
He expanded his empire into multiple profitable businesses
Including his Thai food restaurant, Straits
Internet sites, WeMix.com
And my favorite, MyGhetto.com
The MVP of this rap shit
Luda! I'm a hustler, BALLER, gangsta, CAP PEELER
I stay strapped like your neighborhood trap dealer
And mac-11's that leave you wetter than Michael Phelps! (woo!)
But you'll be swimmin with the fishes
I keep my ear to the STREETS like a cocker spaniel
I cock and blast you into outer space
Break every bone in ya, you so out of place
Boom without a trace, you a bluff to block
I got some red beams, let's play connect the dots!
He's the biggest boss, comin outta the M-I-yayo
Straight from the "Port of Miami"
To keepin it "Trilla"
Involved in many heated acts of violence
This goes deeper than rap shit
I got a letter from the government, the other day
I opened and read it, it said "We were hustlers"
Had a Lexus at 18, picture that
Bitch I know Haitians, we speakin Creole
It cost me five grand just to fill the gas tanks
Three squares on the road, call it 3rd Bass
Keep Jewish friends, the newest Benz
mid-grade
[Tity Boi]
Uhh, I'm so sick I wrote this verse in a hospital
It's an election year, I support strippers
(We roll like bicycles, icicle flow)
I got dogs like Cujo
Bitches catch kudos (you know)
kicks it with them bitches like judo
Theater of the Mind
