Now everybody wants a piece of my pockets
And it don't help when I'm screamin on these records that I'm rich
blue like Crips
I've had my friends steal from me (yup) snatch my credit card
Out my wallet, hit the town and leave outstandin bills for me
and I can't recall
One single member of my family that never asked fo' it
They be kickin down doors, and bustin out floors
And everybody needs a loan plus they say they won't blow it
All I hear is, "C'mon cuz - you know I'm good fo' it!" Man..
And I got one of the biggest families y'all ever seen in y'all life man
Imagine that - fourth and fifth and sixth cousins
Callin me and shit I don't even know who these..
I ain't never met these people in my life!
cause bein rich is such a beautiful thing
But mo' money, mo' problems, people drive me insane
My goal's to set my friends up to make some paper like me
My dividends can show and prove the REAL meanin of fun
The IRS'll never sweat me or even put up a fight
Cause I'm sure I've paid more in taxes than you've made in yo' LIFE, because
Don't play with that IRS man, I'll swear, ain't nothin more embarassin
Than havin them come take all yo' shit out yo' crib man
It happened to some of our heroes, Redd Foxx, Willie Nelson
Peabo Bryson
Buyin jewelry and some cars just to impress these whores
Meanwhile your child's poor like, "Daddy what you left me for?"
Yeah but it all comes back, that's why I named my daughter Karma
'Til I learned the difference between assets and liabilities
