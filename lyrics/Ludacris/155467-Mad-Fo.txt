Time to start putting grown-ass men on time out
Old insecure ass nigga, yo heart pump Kool-Aid man
What you mad at me for? Luda
Or that I'm on that Forbes list making rich rappers look broke
Only rapper in the game with a Grammy and an Oscar
And I'm still feeding the same hood that I came from
Any car that you got I've already drove
Say it with your chest
Name on my headphones
label tatted on my arm
Air traffic control say “Ludacris is insane”
That niggas daughter's birthday's the tail number on his plane
Taking a shot of my cognac
more millions
If I wasn't rapping I'd be probably be in the feds
I used to ball in Philly, with that nina Iguodala
And when I check my bank account, I'm checking for them commas
At 24 I went and bought a Ghost like it was nothing
At 25 I bought that Aston Martin, now we stunting
Real nigga, one hundred
I spit sick on this rap shit, make 'em sick to they stomach
and a black Maybach, call it black on black cause I kill niggas
Bitch I do damage, you gon' need an ambulance
[Verse 5: Pusha T]
Niggas saying you was better when the drugs was in your system
Now your crack swag gone ever since you came from prison
Got you tweeting all stupid,
is you skating, is you dissing?
Hail Mary be the witness
Stupid motherfucking five star, tatted on his ceiling
Ain't y'all the motherfuckers with the millions?
