CEO, you don't have to see ID
Chi-Ali
We in the huddle all smoking that Cheech & Chong
Damn right, the fire marshal wanna shut us down
Get us out, so someone can gun us down
We was two songs away from getting so cut up
Now we one song away from tearing the club up
Work with me, let's become one with the beat
And don't worry about me stepping all over your feet
