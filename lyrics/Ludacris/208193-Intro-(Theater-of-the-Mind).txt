ACTION!
Take 6, Ludacris, it's nice to meet ya
Blow the smoke in the air 'til I blow out your brain turn it up until I blow out your speakers
Gotta keep them Tweeters tweakin, gotta keep them woofers pumpin
Then I blow out one of these verses spit 'em in ya, got a million more comin
However you want it, I can give it but you gotta admit it
Other rappers talk it, try to walk it, Luda live it
Sign it and seal it, multi-mil' it, said it and did it
Then give me sixteen bars on another nigga's song and you know that I'mma fuckin' kill it
Cause I'm the fuckin' realest, when it comes to this rappin' shit
Semi-automatic tongue when I spit another verse cock back, I'm packin' bitch
And I'm back and attackin' with album six tell them other niggas we see danger
Probably cause I got enough, albums to fill yo' CD changer
Gotta buy my whole collection
gotta beat my whole selection
Hit your neighborhood record sto', and you can get it in the smokin' section
Now that's a coke connection, these fiends are addicted to it
No guts no glory, so that's my story and I'm stickin' to it
