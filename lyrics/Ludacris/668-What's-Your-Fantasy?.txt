I wanna, li-li-li-lick you from your head to your toes
And I wanna, move from the bed down to the - down to the, to the flo'
But I gotta kn-kn-kn-know: what-what's your fan-ta-ta-sy?
I wanna get you in the Georgia Dome on the 50 yard line
While the Dirty Birds kick for t'ree
And if you like in the club, we can do it
In the DJ booth or in the back of the V.I.P
Whipped cream with cherries and strawberries on top, lick it don't stop
Keep the door locked,
don't knock while the boat rock
go-bots and robots
beach with black sand
call me the Pac Man
The Rock to the Park to the Point to the Flatlands
cast em
passed em
outlast em
I wanna get you in the bath tub
With the candles lit; you give it up till they go out
Or we can do it on stage at the Ludacris concert
Cause you know it got sold out!
A red carpet dick it just roll out
How about in the library on top of books?
But you can't be too loud!
You wanna make a brother beg for it
Give me TLC cause you know I be too proud
We can do it in the White House
Rose petals on the silk sheets
I wanna get you in the back seat, windows up
That's the way you like to fuck
Clogged up, fog alert
Rip the pants and rip the shirt
Roll around Georgia Brown
Legs jerk
overworked
Underpaid, but don't be afraid
In the sun or up in the shade
On the top of my Escalade
Factories or one hundred spokes!
Whips and chains, handcuffs
Smack a little booty up with my belt
Scream "help!" Play my game!
Dracula, man, I'll get my fangs
I'll get my reins
School teacher, let me get my brains
