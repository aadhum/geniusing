Atlanta, GA
My car just got a Jheri curl the paint's still drippin'
Then I make 'em come around like curl activator
I'm yellow with that purp like I came with the Lakers
the mule and the acres
red, monkey
bathing apers
catch a contact like you inhaled Luda vapors
rapers get smoked like I rolled in some paper
Put 'em in a ash tray throw away the roaches
Miami, FL
Credit cards don't need 'em
All the birds won't feed 'em
E-class on the cell; discussing another mill'
If it ain't a black truck it's a quarter million Maz'
Khaled
The game in a choke hold
No I won't let go
Houston, TX
must be on sherm
streets on fire like raw scalps with a perm
Can't find a triller nigga than me if you had the Hubble
You can get your issue like your ass subscribed
Have you running up north like a runaway slave
