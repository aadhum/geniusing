Nothin' for me to do but smoke up if it's a Friday
Break it down, spread it out, nigga, roll up!
Ludacris, man these bitches want my last name
Get the fuck up out my way, man, move bitch!
And quit yappin' if you never wanna do shit
I get high but the bass low
I'm fucked up! (x4)
I'm high as hell! (x4)
Catch me up in the VIP and it's roped off (Why?)
TO keep raggedy ass hoes off
Ass up... FACE DOWN
One too many American black cards stacked uuuu-u-u-up
I don't want a menage, so bitch, let go
I'm tryin'a get three women, play Connect 4
Your mouth helped me push the Bentley into Mach 5
She got me speedin' in the red zone
Or as Luda like to call it, it's the Head Zone
So make a peace sign baby, put your legs up
