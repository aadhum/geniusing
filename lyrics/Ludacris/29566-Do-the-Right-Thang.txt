Cartridges surround you, but you ain't playin Nintendo games
It's the blues, but not on Hill Street - you could call it "kill or be killed" street
"Lost a pint of blood, let it SPILL" street
STOP AND WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}
WAKE UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!! {*rooster crows*}
You say you want a family but it's hard without a man
And the only way to make it is to get him fo' his change, but I'm sayin
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)
Use your brain baby, do the right thang! (Lemme talk to 'em)
[Ludacris]
Always do the right thing..
I got it, I'm gone
