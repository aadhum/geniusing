From the power bestowed upon me by the third coast
Deep in the trenches of Atlanta where they learned most
You never heard before flows this extra ordinary
And if the burners blow foes is in the mortuary
Here to prevent the destruction of this rap music
Find a blank spot on my wall and put a plaque to it
I'm in the class all by myself nobody's messing with me
[Repeat]
The ladies just cheer sometimes their lipstick will smear â€˜cause in my line of work this He-man needs a She-Ra
I've been appointed straight from the power of Grayskull
Believe the master of the universe gets great skull
I'm so ferocious chopping heads off with my battle axe
Got many faces give them whiplash when I battle Zakk
With powerful beams that disperse from my Ludacris-tal balls
As Mekaneck neck extends straight up and bends
You'd be wishing you wore Depends and called a couple friends
attack tack
