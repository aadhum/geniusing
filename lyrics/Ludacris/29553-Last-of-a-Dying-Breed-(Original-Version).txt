I done killed so many niggas in the booth I sell rappers on eBay
Soldiers couldn't cause more disaster on D-Day
Cause every hit record's been instant like replays
Tell her she should blow me like candles on yo' B-day
More wood up in my whip than in a forest full of cabins
And yes I stay high on that purple like Aladdin
I got it baby!
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin, yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Little Carter, or Little Cardiac
valuable like a quarterback
Hannibal like they call me Jack
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine
This is music Musclemania, my verse is on steroids
Private planes, I'm on the jet, son, like Elroy
Flying through the sky at amazing speeds
We on that Superman kush or that amazing weed
The new Bentley came out, my team said, "Luda, get it!"
20 thou' says that I'm the only nigga wit it!
New Era on yo' brain like a A-town fitted
And I'm not E-40 but I'm so Sick Wid It
Me and Wayne on that lean, what the FUCK was you drinkin?
