Hey! Thank all y'all for coming out tonight
It was a beautiful night tonight at The Shizznit
Where pimping ain't dead, these hoes just scared
Thanks Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, all the players
LBC
Oh, look at these fools, Ay! Security! Come get these niggas!
Ready to relax, kick up my feet
Maybe smoke a blunt or two, that's what I wanna do
Broke out and called up the homeboy Snoop (What happenin' nephew?)
(Well you hit the right dogg, I can help you with that
Gimme 15 minutes, and I'll hit you rite back)
Slapped the button in the 'llac to control the speed
Waved my hands out the roof like I just ain't care
[Hook]
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
Who let these hoes in my room? (Did you let 'em in?)
Who let these hoes in my room? (These hoes)
Who let these hoes in my room?
Shit, all around the world Luda, then it's the same song
One was 5'6 and weighed three hundred pounds
big fat whale of it
Bitch ya' pussy smell like Pepe Le Pew
But I was turned off by her tupperware titties
Bill O'Reilly (Faggot)
(Ya' white bread, chicken-shit nigga!)
Sick of these ugly ass bitches being my dressing room
