Shake your money maker
Like somebody's bout to pay ya
I see you on my radar
Don't you act like you're afraid of shit
You know I got it
If you wanna come get it
Stand next to this money
Like - ey ey ey
Don't worry about them haters
Keep your nose up in the air
Shake, shake, shake your money maker
Like you were shaking it for some paper
It took your momma 9 months to make ya
Might as well shake what your momma gave ya
You, you lookin' good in them jeans
I bet you'd look even better with me in between
I keep my mind on my money - money on my mind
But you's a hell of a distraction when you shake your behind
I got J.O. up on my right side pourin' some cups
So by tomorrow you forgot what you were saying today
And all the calories you burn from me making you sweat
The mile-high points you earn when we taking my jet
How everywhere you turn I'll be making you wet cause you can
Switch, switch, switch it from right to left
And switch it till you running right out of breath
And take a break until you ready again
And you can invite over as many friends as
You want to but I really want you
Just be thankful that Pharrell gave you something to bump to hey
You want my hands from your bottom to the top of your frame
And I - just wanna take a little ride on your curves
Let me give you some swimming lessons on the penis
Backstroke, breaststroke, stroke of a genius
Yepp call me the renaissance man
get up and
I stay harder then a cinderblock man
Hey I'm just a bedroom gangster
Rock rock, rock it an make it work, girl
Please don't stop it until it hurts, girl
See I'm a member of the BBC
The original breadwinner of DTP
