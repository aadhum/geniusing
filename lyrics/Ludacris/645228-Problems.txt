So I'd give it all up to repeat life over
And they'd say dude is a fool
I can't trust another motherfucker living in this world
And this really got me losing my cool
What would you'd do if you were in my situation
And the minute everyone you ever loved to say you looked up
In the strip club looking for familiar faces
People know me on a first name basis
But all they ever really want is my cash
Let me borrow just a couple hundred dollars
And you know that I'm a pay you back, my ass
This world so superficial
This world done lost my trust
Doc said I need to change my diet, cause I'm really not eating right
Mama said I need some peace and quiet, cause I'm really not sleeping right
Cause I gotta feed family, some of the same ones that abandoned me
Who the fuck put me in charge of making all of these decisions
