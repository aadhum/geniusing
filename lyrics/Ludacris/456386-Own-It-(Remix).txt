[Hook: Mack Wilds]
Tell me where you wanna go
What you wanna do
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it
Said I'm on top of the world
And what I need is you
Said we living it like we own it
Own it, own it, own it

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Nothing's too much
Words that I live by
And that's just how I do
Do, I do
I'm young right now
But I won't be forever
So I'mma live it up like that's true
You might wanna roll with me too

[Pre-Hook: Mack Wilds]
Said I don't mean to brag
But I live a life that most can only dream about, yeah
So baby come be my dream girl
Pick a fantasy and let me work it out, yeah, oh yeah

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mack Wilds]
Its never too much
So just let the drinks flow
Later on you can come through
Through, come through
You know you're the flyest
They should call you your highness
And call me king cause I'm that dude
All you gotta do is leave your crew

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge: Mack Wilds]
What you talkin' bout?
We run this town
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
What you talkin' bout?
You deserve this crown
We got it sewn up
Because we own it
Because we own it

[Hook]
