Awww yeah, welcome back to Battle of the Sexes Radio
Where it is 12:45 in the A.M. and Disturbing Tha Peace is our in-studio guest
Our hotline is lit the fuck up with people with relationship issues
Caller number one, you're on the air
Yeah man, y'all tell me if I'm crazy cause this girl in here trippin
Y'knowmsayin? I'm a real man, I take care of her
I take care of my kids, I pay all my bills
I mean I ain't gon' lie, I may check a lil' female from time to time on the side
Y'knowmtalkinbout, but what man don't? So how can I break this down to her?
But don't call me after midnight, unless we havin sex
So don't be all up in my phone replying to women's pages
I thought your momma told you, you should never talk to strangers
Don't ever ask no questions that you really don't want the answers to
Stop poppin off at the mouth or like Nino Brown I'll have to cancel you
DTP stay in the zone, like we on PCP
Pineapple and Belve', we feelin' so good
Um, ain't no such thing as a plutonic friend
