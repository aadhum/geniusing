How low can you go? How low can you go?
Haha, Luda!
She can go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans, baby pull your pants up
I like it when I see you do it, better than I've ever seen I done befo'
A lot of, women, drop it to the ground, but how low can you go?
Lower than your mama's ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined it, not even in her right mind
Practice in front of that mirror, now you doing it on the dance flo'
Mad 'cause I can't get with you, chick, just show me how to dance, oh
I may not wanna get low, so I'm posted up, kinda like a player do
But if you come to the crib, then I might show you girls a thang or two
Yeah, I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, there's just one thang that I gotta know
How low can you go? How low can you go?
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
How many licks does it take 'til I get to the center and let a realer nigga take you home?
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A-N all the way down to yo' block
And I make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really get low, then I'ma shoot a video and put it all on TV
'Cause I like that French vanilla (French vanilla)
And the caramel (and the caramel)
But when it comes to chocolate (when it comes to chocolate)
I know that very well
Asian persuasion, no discrimination, I love how they seem to please us
'Cause I think you a superstar, with a ass like that you gotta blow
Befo' you make it big, well, there's just one thang that I gotta know
How low can you go? How low can you go?
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Don't, stop â€“ get it, get it
Put it in reverse just to back it up
Let me put some Luda in it
Show me whatchu working with, I'll show you some of this bank, roll
How low can you go? How low can you go?
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know
