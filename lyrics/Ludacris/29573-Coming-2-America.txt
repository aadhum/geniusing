(Thank you, king shit)
These bitches throwin' rose petals at my feet mayne!
They wanna spoil me, treatin' me like royalty;
What I'm 'sposed to do? It's such a sweet thang
That's why they stay down, they loyal citizens of Zamunda
Don't even look at me ho don't pass go just go straight to jail
With no probation or bail, but this ain't Monopoly
It's Jolly Green Giants cause we smoke so much broccoli
And testing me, is like pitbulls put up to poodles
It's ludicrous - I pack more nuts than Delta Airlines
Cause I've been saved by mo' bells than Lark Voorhies
Man fuck that nigga 'Cris man, for real man. I'm tired of this shit man. Man I try to rap for the nigga, I try to get on a nigga tracks; he ain't hearin my shit. Man, for real! Man my four-year-old son can rap better than that nigga; man that nigga garbage. Man I got talent too, the nigga ain't hearin me. Man iii-iiiis this shit on? 'Cris, c'mon 'Cris. 'Cris, f'real man. FUCK YOU NIGGA, MAN FUCK YOU!
Scrawny nigga
You see y'all got it all wrong like women in tuxedos
And comin up shorter than five Danny DeVitos
three amigos
I find gold links and snatch 'em, like I'm Deebo
But I'm the light-skinte-ted version, of Mandingo
And I stay with more BULLETS, than yo' Billboard singles
[Ludacris]
C.P. set a bigger trap look at that Godby Road and Old Nat
Where they kick it at?
Shady Park you heard just don't go
I'm on, FIRE!
And you know I can't stop 'til I re-TIRE!
Oh no, we stay swoll, rollin on Vogue TIRES!
