6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a new whip I cause a scene
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake
Disturb your peace
with fifteens that thump
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene
I got two floors in my trunk
club lights in my trunk
I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
Cause it's an earthquake when I park
I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette
007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a  new whip I cause a scene
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk?
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
O-o-o-okay, now bow down when you see me, don't be trippin' on the thump
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk?
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
