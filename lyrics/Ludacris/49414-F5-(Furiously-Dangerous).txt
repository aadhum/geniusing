I pack the zero's, meaning mucho dinero
So paid, rappers is waitinâ€™ on trades
And they all gettin' Knicked like Melo
Tell theses other boys double up
Cause I got some work all on my waste but I call it a tummy tuck
Bad GM, what you want to trade slugs with him for
Then leave 'em for you to rebound
Kevin Love on the boards
Cause bitch I'm bonker, plural
She on E, feelin' on me, singin' on-key
While I'm bumpin', We Are the World
We run this town
No he isn't Diddy
I ain't finna say nothin'
Turn the bass up more til the speakers pop
I get a kick outta that, like a sneaker spot
Rep that West til I walk with Pac
We the 2.0 Boys, Tiz, Crook and Joe, Royce
I'm top seed, I clock green at mach speed
So watch me if you haven't seen a phenomenon
Spit fast as Lamborghini's and Ramadan
