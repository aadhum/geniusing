I’ll be representing, representing
You represent for bad bitches all around the world
The way you put it down in between the sheets
Is like no other girl
You done take it a whole another level of freakiness
When you blow my mind
To the point where all the other women
Kinda feeling like you stole their shine
So I better come with it, then I better come spilt it
And I can admit that I’m feeling a little pressure
When you’re telling me I better come get it
But I’m the man for the job
Can’t nobody do it quite like I do
And the same go for you
We a match made in heaven
I’ma stand right by you
While you saying?
Just wanna keep all your attention baby
It turns me on to know I turn you on, yeah
Can I grab the wheel and drive you crazy
(Yeah, alright, alright, alright, hey)
Sit in the front row and watch me perform
(You do that and you gonna learn today)
I’ll be representing, representing
I’ll be representing, representing
Watch how I put it down put it down
Put it down like ay
Only know you can do it
Then I’ma hit every single one of your spots
And really you don’t need to walk me through it
But you can talk me through it
What I’m asking if it’s mine
Cause I'mma be your motivation
Just tryina see if you can break my fucking spine
I’m so attracted, to the way you carry yourself
And keep your composure
You a lady in the street
But behind closed doors you’re a fucking soldier
Body is so angelical, the rebel with a cause
Speaking in hypotheticals
Could I marry you if I wanted to
You give me that good and plenty
Then I walk around all day grinning
You make me wanna call the crib
And say I’m never coming home, Luda!
