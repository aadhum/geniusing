I done killed so many niggas in the booth I sell rappers on eBay (hey!)
Cause every one of my verses been instant like replays (hey!)
Speakers get blown like candles on yo' B-day (hey!)
The bank yells "MAYDAY" cause every day's a payday
I put it on tape and then I'll sell it like Ray J
But not out the sto' (nope) straight to the buyer
Cause I slung 'em out my trunk like the D.C. sniper
And six albums later you'll deposit every word
'Til your memory bank gives me the credit
Top 5, damn right! But really it just hit me
That three of yo' top 5's too scared to FUCK with me (woo!)
So how can I advance if you don't give me no opponents?
Hip-Hop couldn't die, I never offer my condolence
But I'll offer y'all a day of atonement
I'm a lyricist to the death, so I got what you need
Ludacris, I'm the last of a dyin breed
And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud
Say it with me: MC means move the crowd (3x)
{scratches: "M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd"}
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses
Like the Red Sea
I wear red like roses
Go against me and you'll be dead like roses
full of bread like toasters
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack
But you see I keep it pumpin', yeah I got that heart back
So just call me Lil Carter, or Lil Cardiac
Precious like an artifact
valuable like a quarterback
throwback like a Starter hat
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine
For the dirty and fine,
They say O'Reilly don't like him
Oprah won't invite him
The president denounced him (yeah) no one will announce him (no!)
Controversial lyrics like I'm cryin for help
I'm very talented, but I should be ashamed of myself (woo!)
But this is my art (art) this is my music (hey!)
YouTube or Google me, turn it up and play it (hey!)
Cause many people think it, I just had the balls to say it (what?)
And risk losin everything
