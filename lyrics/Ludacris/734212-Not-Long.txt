If you look to the stars, you'll find that your not far from them
And if you follow your heart, you'll find that you'll be one of them
Unsigned performing at every open mic
I'm just tryna ride the waves baby surfs up
skirts
So when critics write articles of my chronicles
I wonder if my hunger is felt in they abdominals
Where thoughts become things from the power of attraction
Look its not long til the fights over
The turbulence is non stop till the flights over
So when passengers panic just stay silent
And realize its never too late to become the pilot
I'd rather struggle to working for me than working for someone else
Cuz I'm the master of the Ludaverse
