They jingalin baby, go ahead baby x4
Jingalin, jingalin, jingalin, jingalin
She jingalin
Jingalin, jingalin, jingalin, jingalin
Woah, she jingalin
Jingalin, jingalin, jingalin, jingalin
She jingalin
Jingalin, jingalin, jingalin, jingalin
Woah, she jingalin
Go ahead baby, Go ahead baby, do that shit right there x3
Jingal it baby, Jingal it baby
Just when she hit that stripper pole, her booty swallow it
We going to take a sip of that potion, put some things in motion
Now jingal that shit like it's jello
She be jingalin so much, she got me digging all in my wallet
I'll bang out that headboard so much we'll make the bed ache
Now jingal til you get a headache
