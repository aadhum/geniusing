My chick bad, my chick hood
[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
She always bring the racket like Venus and Serena
My chick bad, my chick hood
[Verse 2 - Ludacris]
She rides that dick and she handles her liquor
Comin' out swingin' like Tiger Woods' wife
Yeahhh, she could get a little hasty
Comin down the street like a parade, Macy's
(Whoo!) I fill 'er up, balloons
Test her and guns get drawn like cartoons
D'oh, but I ain't talkin 'bout Homer
My chick bad, my chick hood
Young, now-now-now-now
Now all these bitches wanna try and be my besty
But I take a left and leave them hangin' like a teste
Trash talk to 'em then I put 'em in a Hefty
Runnin' down the court I'm dunkin' on 'em, Lisa Leslie
It-it-it-it-it's goin' down, basement
Friday the 13th, guess who's playing Jason
Tuck yourself in, you better hold onto your teddy
It's Nightmare on Elm Street and guess who's playin' Freddy
My chick bad, chef cookin' for me
They say my shoe game crazy, the mental asylum lookin for me
you a rookie to me
I'm in that wham-bam purple Lam,
damn bitch you been a fan
My chick bad (don't get scared now, haha!), my chick hood
Luda, DTP
And when we all alone, I might just tip her
She slides down the pole, like a certified stripper
When we all alone I might tip, tip her
