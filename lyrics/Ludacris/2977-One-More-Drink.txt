It was Friday night
feelin aight
Downtown Atlanta, big city, bright lights
Mixin Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinkin and drivin
To spread a little love and spread a couple cheeks (cheeks)
Pull up to the spot 26's like BAM!
Eyes on me like, "Bitch do you SEE 'EM?"
Strolled through the front do' headed to the VIP (VIP)
Bought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (sips)
Scopin out the room, and what do I SEE?
A nice round butt, and a pair of double D's!
"Shorty what's happenin
You killin that dress and I love it with a passion"
Then she turned around and her face was aight
She had a gap tooth and a mean overbite
but I was like hmmmm
if I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
Is that what you wanna do, shorty?
If I take one more drink, I'm gon' end up fuckin you
Woke up the next mornin and all I can remember
Was takin shots and tippin the bartender
Cause she started lookin better every shot of Patron, yup!
I jumped up with a devilish grin
Cause tonight, damn right I might do it again
So I called up the homies
Get a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (yup)
Went up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes
then mannnnn
[Hook]
Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah
Equals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda
People too picky these days, damnit
Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny
Have a couple of drinks and quit discriminatin
This has been a Luda Service Announcement
