No one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, swoosh
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
All night tryna dutty wine
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven
She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven
[Outro: Section 25 sample]
You can see through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
