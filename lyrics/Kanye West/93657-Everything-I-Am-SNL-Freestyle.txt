[Hook]
Damn, here we go again
Common passed on this beat, I made it to a jam
Now everything I'm not, made me everything I am
Damn, here we go again
People talking shit, but when shit hit the fan
Everything I'm not, made me everything I am

[Verse 1]
I'll never be picture perfect Beyoncé
Be light as Al B., or black as Chaun-cey
Remember him from Blackstreet, he was as black as the street was
I never be as laid back as this beat was
I never could see why people reach a
Fake ass facade that they couldn't keep up
You see how I creeped up
You see how I played the big role in "Chicago" like Queen Latifah
I never rock a mink coat in the sum-time like Killa Cam
Or rock some mi-mink boots in the winter time like Will.I.Am
Let me know if you feel it man
I just messed up on my rap, live TV like damn
Yo, off the top of the dome, dome
Shout out to Chi-town where I call home
Coast to coast, LA to New York to London to Paris
Shout out to Barry
That's my security guard
Cause my rhymes is hard
Listen up I got to praise god
For the number one spot that I got cause I'm hot
Cause I never was shot
They said I'd never make raps to hit the block
Or never sold a crack rock
But now everybody on the jock
And I got the game lock
Everybody bring it back
With the rap I don't know how to act I go crazy
Backstage, Beyoncé and Jay-Z
And Lebron
Yo, I meant to freestyle, I meant to mess up
Y'all thought they'd never let me back in NBC
