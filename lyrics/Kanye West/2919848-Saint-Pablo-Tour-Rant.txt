Stop it, stop it.
Hey radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you!
Radio lied to you. Radio, fuck you! I know it’s a lot of real niggas working at radio, real people, real programming directors with wives and kids that love music, that can’t play what they want to play because they’ve been paid to play that bullshit over and over and over. And when I say that bullshit, what I’m saying is: we love Drake, Drake is great. He’s a great artist. But Frank Ocean is great, too! But you know who the greatest of all of us? Who do y’all think?
[crowd shouts “Kanye” and other names]
Nope. Kid motherfucking Cudi.
Radio, fuck you!
Radio, fuck you.
Radio, fuck you! Radio, fuck you! Wait a second. Eh, is it, “'Radio, fuck you?' That’s what you’re saying?” Exactly.

Not fuck the people that work at radio because these is real people that gotta feed they kids and they’re not being allowed to play that real shit because they think that in order to feed they kids they gotta play the same shit over and over and over.
