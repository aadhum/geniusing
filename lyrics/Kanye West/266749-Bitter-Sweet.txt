Bittersweet, you're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you,
I love you and I hate you at the very same time
See what I want so much, should never hurt this bad
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
God talk to me now this is an emergency
And she claim she only with me for the currency
You cut me deep bitch, cut me like surgery
And I was too proud to admit that it was hurtin' me
I'd never do that to you at least purposely
We breakin' up again
We makin' up again
But we don't love no more
I guess we fuckin' then
Have you ever felt you want to kill her
And you mixed them emotions with Tequila
And you mix that with a little bad advice
On one of them bad nights you have a bad fight
And you talkin' about her family, her aunts and shit
And she say motherfucker your mama's a bitch
You know, domestic drama and shit
All the attitude
I'll never hit a girl but I'll shake the shit out of you
But Ima be the bigger man
Big pimpin' like Jigga man
Oh I guess I figure it's
You're gonna be the death of me
I don't want you, but I need you
I love you and I hate you at the very same time
Never did this before, that's what the virgin says
We've been generally warned, that's what the surgeon says
And my niggas said I shouldn't let it worry me
I need to focus on the girls we getting currently
this relationship even got me back to drinkin' and this Hennessy
Is gonna be the death of me
And I always thought that you havin' my child was our destiny
But I can't even vibe with you sexually
Coz every time that I try you will question me
And this the first time she ever spit her soul to me
I fucked up and I know it G
I guess it's bittersweet poetry
