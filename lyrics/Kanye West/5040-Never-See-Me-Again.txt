And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
They want me to hold my head in shame
I guess... finna chop it's head off
I need a little something to knock the edge off
Aside from this song, life sucks
modest
And every good god needs a goddess
I don't like them, they don't like that
They don't like that, I don't want that
Don't worry about me, worry about you
Worry about something, don't worry what I do
Hating motherfuckers, it'll be a long time
Before you ever see me again, me again
I put in every date, rocking in every state
Do not debate, you cannot cape
Guess its my fate, guess it was written
everybody's just spitting
And what it sound like when everybody sound like
What you sound like, bumpin' 'em on a round mic
And these niggas are secondary like Pippen around Mike
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout them, don't worry 'bout you, and what you gonna do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you and baby I do
Don't worry bout something else we can't do
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, don't worry 'bout you, and worry 'bout something else we can't do...
And it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Don't worry 'bout me, and it'll be a long time before you ever see me again, me again
Again, again
Before you ever see me again, me again
It'll be a long time before you ever see me again
Section 8
So I pass that dick around like the collection plate
Or feeling like Ike at the end of the movie
Or feeling like Eddie Kane, I still got it
Maybe I should stop being real, maybe I should get on Twitter
I can stand and deliver 'til the...
Cause you know what? A coward dies a thousand deaths
And who can run the planet? Pass them a
Xanax
I wish we just could take it back to the Book of Genesis
