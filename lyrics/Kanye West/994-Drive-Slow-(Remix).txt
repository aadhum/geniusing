[Kanye West]
My car's like the movie, my car's like the crib
I got more TV's in here than where I live
And that don't make no sense, but baby I'm the shit
I got the custom grill
I got the Brabus rims
I got the baller genetics
You see a player flicking and how you ain't convinced
That you should go on and kiss it, just a lil bit
I'm riding on Vogues
I sold O's
Looking at life through my rearview, all the problems I had
Could be seen a lot clearer after time had passed
Known for living so fast, they wonder how he don't crash
With 220 on the dash, he constantly mashing
Why don't he slow down?" they be constantly asking
But me in the fast lane is like metal and magnets
Now I ain't trying to say that it's the way of the masses
But it's so hard to change, I love this shit with a passion
Since me and Sigel cutting classes, showing our ass
Shooting out in broad day in the middle of traffic
I remember selling crack faster than I could bag it
Just sharing my past with you shawty, I ain't bragging
Me and Cap got life, some other folk got blasted
Had a partner O.D. and after this all happened
It's like the only thing that kept a pimp from crying is laughing
And the Lord smiled on me at the end of the madness
I never thought that I'd make it this far rapping
For introducing the youth to what we now call "trappin'"
Considered now a classic, who'd have imagined?
Me in Milano getting models
in next year's fashions
So nowadays, they can call me old-fashioned
But it's way too much cash to see blue lights flashing
So I guess the moral of this here class is:
Life about who make it now, not about who make it the fastest
