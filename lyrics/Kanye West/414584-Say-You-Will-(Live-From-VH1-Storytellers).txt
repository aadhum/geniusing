[Verse 1]
Why would she make calls out the blue?
Now I'm awake, sleepless in June

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, then play you will, I pray you will

[Verse 2]
Mrs. So Fly crash-lands in my room
Can't waste no time, she might leave soon

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you do
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, one day you will, I pray you will

[Verse 3]
When I grab your neck, I touch your soul
Take off your cool then lose control

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, unless you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, I pray you will, I pray you will

[Verse 4]
I wish this song would really come true
I admit I still fantasize about you, about you

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will, unless you will, I pray you will

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will, you will, you will
Hey hey hey hey
Don’t say you will

Hey hey hey hey…

Hey hey hey hey
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t say
This is a
This song was written for
A special moment in my life
Someone so special, that I love forever
