I'd rather just let the music speak for itself. You know, it's like, I was happy to be in a situation where people couldn't say, oh, I was trying to promote my own song.
I'm pushing the envelope! I wrote my fuckin' 'Run This Town' verse for a fuckin' month!
When I heard Eminem's verse on the Drake shit, I went back and rewrote my shit for two days
I canceled appointments to rewrite! I fuckin' care! You know what I'm saying? And that's what I'm saying.
Because I did that, Taylor Swift cannot win over Beyoncé! Because I wrote my verse in two days, Taylor Swift cannot beat Beyoncé.
As long as I'm alive! And if I'm alive, kill me then! Kill me then! As long as I'm alive, you gon' have to deal with it.
Cause there ain't gonna be no more motherfucking Elvises with no James Browns.
Because my mother got arrested for the fuckin' sit-ins. My mother died for this fame shit!
I moved to fuckin' Hollywood chasing this shit.
My mother died because of this shit.
Fuck MTV.
What the fuck was Pink performing?
Don't nobody know that song
Pink performed twice! Two songs? How the fuck Pink perform twice, and I didn't even get asked to perform
"Heartless."
"Heartless" is the biggest song of the year! It had the most spins of the first quarter!
I don't know that Pink song! But I noticed that she's pink!
