N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
(I need you right now!)
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!
[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
(I need you right now!)
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)
[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
[Hook]
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)
Right now!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
(I need you right now!)
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
