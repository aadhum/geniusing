Now I'm the newest member of the rockafella team
And I'ma bring Dame and HOV mad more cream
For the last time it's 'Kanye' and not Kane
Everybody mispronouncing the name
So I spell it over and over
Why she wanna say 'hello,'
Cuz my Rock-a-fello piece is all yellow?
My diamond ornaments help me fornicate
Girls that look like they on a porno tape
Cuz I made a mil off instrumentals
I got a 'You Hear It First' 'fore I signed a deal
