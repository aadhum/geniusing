Because I was so, [?] down in your soul
And look to the sky above
Being liked if nothing, when you could be loved
God is love
God is love
God is love
God is love
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more disliked, the better I must be doing
Because most artists aren't appreciated in their own time
So the more and more disliked, the better I must be doing
If you love someone tonight
Hold on to it
If you love someone tonight
Hold on, hold on real tight
Hold on, hold on real tight
