Plain Pat, what up?
Why did he say it? I don't know, ask Gabe
Poppin' champagne and that Ros√© Don
And yup in my bag a whole bag of porn
Cover of The Fader (yeah)
I be talking my shit so I guess I'm an asshole
They be kick and pushin' like Lu Fiasco
I did an interview with The Rolling Stones
Read the interview, man the whole shit wrong
Far as this shit go, you know the way I wanna glow
I need Al Gore to recount that vote
