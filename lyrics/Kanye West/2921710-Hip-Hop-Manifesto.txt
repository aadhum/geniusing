But he wasn’t talkin’ bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word...
And he explained the story about how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Projects to’ up, gang signs is thrown up
Niggas hats broke off, that’s how we grow up
Why else you think shorties write rhymes just to blow up?
Cause who the kids gon’ listen to, huh?
I guess me, if it isn’t you
Last week I paid a visit to the institute
They got the dropout keeping kids in the school
They like, ‘Oh God, why he go so hard?
Look what’s he’s been through he deserves an applause
People don’t even want to hear the preacher spill or spiel
Because God’s whole card has been thoroughly piqued
And now America is now blood and tears instead of milk and honey
What you want a Bentley, fur coat, a diamond chain?
All you Blacks want all the same things!
So why send oppression not blessings?
Why, oh why you’d do me wrong
You persecute the weak
Because it makes you feel so strong
