My friend showed me pictures of his kids
And all i could show him was pictures of my cribs
He said his daughter got a brand new report card
And my head keeps spinning
Can't stop having these visions I gotta get with it
Dad cracked a joke all the kids laughed
But i couldn't hear 'em all the way in first class
Chased the good life my whole life long
Look back on my life and my life gone... where did I go wrong?
Bad enough that i showed up late
I had to leave before they even cut the cake
Welcome to heartbreak
And I, and I can't stop
No, no I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
No, no, no, no, I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
I can't stop
