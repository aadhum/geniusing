Somebody told me Delta's brown-skinned, AKA's light-skinned
And they supposed to be bougie, so they got white friends
First day of school, I'mma take you sight seein'
Show you what we do on weekends for excitement
She said, "I know what you about to say, like your hypeman"
Last year a nigga hit her,
and now she only date white men
And if a nigga even wave at her, it's frightenin', but
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it
The night fallin' over Brooklyn
where they murder for change
The converter remains faithful to the drug dealer priestess
Kweli the truth like I'm comin' out the mouths of babes
One foot in and one foot out the grave
Niggas want they reparations, how you calculate the amount to be paid?
You try to imagine America without the slaves (The slaves)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it
Her tenament, yo, is rat infested
Her heart is like a gold bullion because she went and protested
'Cause her best friend's man got popped
He was sixteen years old, the cop thought his phone was a Glock
In the hood is an everyday happenin'
In front of the precinct, she chews out the captain
She yells out, "Why y'all do this to black men?" C'mon
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it
I think of eighty-seven ways
to make better days
Whether crime or rhyme, I heard the rebel pays
On the scene, tryin' to get green like everglades
The music, ridin' it good like Escalades
In the ghetto infested by shade and drama
And niggas wit' thangs ain't afraid of karma
I'm thinkin' big like Lil Wayne in The Carter's that-
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it
Terrorism on blacks, they poison our Newports
Patriot Act in effect, make it hard to breathe now
Johnnie Cochran dead, who gonna get us "Us free" now?
Clinton ain't in office, who gon' give us shit free now?
Oh, it's G.O.O.D. Music, yeah, dawg, I see now
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can make it on up, we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it better
(Better we can)
("Breaking up") We can make it
