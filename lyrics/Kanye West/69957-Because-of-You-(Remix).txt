I think it's time to hit 'em with the Mase flow
My uh she was gettin the best of me
But oooh child you my destiny
and I know it's especially
Hard with all these girls just testing me
Uh and you gon' question me
If she even stand next to me
but you should laugh
Cause you my better half (woman laughing)
And these girls just fighting over the rest of me
Right now it feels so crazy, I know she just some lady
And my outfit is just so 80's
Not to mention McLaren Mercedes
And the 26 inch rim wheels looks so good with your 6-inch heels
Fly that you be on
Gucci on, aligned by Louie Vuitton
And we high as the way we cruising on
High like I like mercury
Why do I mention the solar system?
Cause, you in my soul and system
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
And it's all because of you [x3]
And it's all because...
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
Think of it every second
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time, I'm gonna get me some
Know I should stay away from, cause it's no good for me
I try and try but my obsession won't let me leave
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm taken by the thought of it, and I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction, I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
She's the sweetest drug, she's the sweetest drug
