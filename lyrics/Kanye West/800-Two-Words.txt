[Intro: Kanye West]
We in the streets, playa, get ya mail
It's only two places you end up, either dead or in jail
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
Hook: Kanye West
Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
Two words, United States, no love, no breaks
Low brow,
high stakes,
crack smoke, black folks
Big Macs, fat folks,
ecstasy capsules
Presidential scandals
Two words, Mos Def, K. West, hot shit
BK, NY, Bed Stuy
Too harsh, too hungry, too many, that's why
These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
Black Jack
Hook: Kanye West (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)
Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes (Throw your hands up high)
Busters
boosters
Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
Two words, Chi-town, South Side, worldwide
Cause I rep that 'til I fuckin' die
One neck two chains,
One wall twenty plaques, dues paid, gimme that
I am limelight,
Blueprint five mics
Go Getters rhyme like, should've been signed twice
Most imitated
Grammy nominated
Barbershop playa-hated
mom-and-pop bootlegged it
Felt like it rained 'til the roof caved in
Two words, Chi-town raised me crazy
So I live by two words: "fuck you, pay me"
I can't let 'em change me
And I basically know now
We get racially profiled
'Cuffed up and hosed down, pimped up and ho'd down
Plus I got a whole city to hold down
From the bottom so the top's
The only place to go now
Hook: Kanye West (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)
Now throw ya hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes (Throw your hands up high)
[Verse 3: Freeway]
Two words, free way, two letters, AR
Turn y'all rap niggas to two words, fast runners
Like Jackie Joyner
The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car, my God
Break necks, break backs, Steven Seagal
freshman of the Roc
Two words, Freeway slightly retarded
Fuck around, throw a clip in ya artist, leave with his broad
Outro: Mos Def (w/ Harlem Boys Choir)
Motherfuckers askin' "who is that?"
You know it's the almighty Black Jack
Mos Def, K. West
Black Jack Johnson, it's no contest
