Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Niggas reppin' the 'Go, but we can't tell
You bought one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale
Politics kept me at the end of the mixtapes
So I dropped my own get-well-soon-from-sick tape
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
I'm trying to do numbers like Pac did
But it ain't Shakur, it's the brand new Roc kid
Niggas wanna get me like they got B.I.G
'Cause I moved up out the city and got big
Niggas talk so much shit about me in barbershops, they forget to get their hair cut
Okay, fair enough, the streets is flarin' up
'Cause they want gun talk, and I don't go there enough
But don't get it fucked up, you can still get your head bust
I'm making way too much dough to be playing
And this is a classic in the making, history repeats itself
He do the rhymes and the beats himself
The only-child syndrome, make hits on his own
And I'mma look in the mirror if I need some help
You copped one pair of 1s on a two-for-one sale
Cop oz by the case like Dirty
I made it to the Power 30 a whole hour early
I'mma pull out the shank and bang ya
I'mma cut a nigga up like LL trainer
This is the future of the Chi
This is the legacy of Twista, The Flic' , and Do or Die
My-my my name is Kanye and not Kayne, bitch
At home like Cambridge,
look at what I came with
No, none of that same shit, that new and improved
Now I don't know if it's me or how yellow my Roc-A-Fella chain is
You copped one pair of 1s at a two-for-one sale
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
Damn, Kanye, is that your car?
