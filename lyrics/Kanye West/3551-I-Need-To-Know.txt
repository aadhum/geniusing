I need to know, you down to do whatever?
Down to get it poppin? Down to get topless, ohh
I need to know, if you about cutting
Or you about frontin, baby I need to know
I spent my last 8 checks's on a neck-e-lace
So I better get some sex for this, shiit
She wanna sip up on the cris-e-cris
Like it's Christ-e-mas and I'm St. Nicholas
I got her and her sister innn
That white benz, dyke twins
I ain't gon lie they only fives but together they ten's
And would I do 'em again? Hmmm, hmmm?
It's like old folks pissin cause it all depends
And it's no coke sniffin just juice and gin
I like a girl with a sense of humor
To give me head til it ache and it's not a tumor
So let me know what's goin down 'fo I pay for this room cuz
Sissy niggas call 'em
maricon
I never hit a lady but my game might abuse 'em
By 'em boots just to tell them that I Jimmy Choose 'em
Take 'em back to confuse 'em
Cuz mami after I'm cumming I'm going
Cuz my diamonds yellow like a smoker tooth
[Verse 3]
Now there's three different levels to relationships
Polly'n at the club wit em, talking getting affectionate
Leavin and havin sex with em, kickin them out
Trickin on models, dimes and rats, now I don't get into that
I kick that habit, I just, keep 'em impressed
Let 'em seat in the Lex, never, eat 'em unless
That fuckin cat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin
I got a nine in my pants and baby I'm just dyin for a chance
Who ready to fuck? You ready to fuck? Off the sizzurp
Says she ready to cut, then she grabs my scissors
She prolly look good but what's scary to me
Henny make hoes look like Halle Berry to me
