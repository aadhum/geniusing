I've been waiting my life; and I stayed on my grind
I don't wanna hear that bull shit, I wanna hear that official shit
Kanye and that Twista shit
that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it
Get it, that's so impossible to get it (It's impossible)
With Kanye and get it jukking in the club like this
I'm sippin on my Henn'
Holla at a chick while she sippin on her gin
(It's just impossible)
For you to get it if you don't wanna win;
so get up off ya ass
And go for yours, and never for mine
[Twista]
Lil mama, for you to fit all that up in a pants; movin' kinda wilder
Turn a regular jeans in a low riders
For you to ever deny, that I'm about Chi-town
The controversy can't worse me man
I'm eating but I'm still thirsty
Why the hell is I'm worrying, hopping out the Benz with the perfect 10
"Man your life must be perfect man, look at how they came up with the perfect plan"
Got strip clubs playin gosspital
Girl
You know I jumped out like 'Pac'll do
Since Michael Jackson made "Rock With You"
[Outro]
