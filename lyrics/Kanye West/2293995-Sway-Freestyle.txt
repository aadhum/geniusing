I can make shit rhyme
I can make shit rhyme if I, feel like
And if I, don't. So I just might not, cause I, don't want
And i'm just gonna. Freestyle for the first time
With a freestyle, that don't
Even go together
Ough
No rhymes that's my new shit!
Nothing rhyme!
How that sound!
Uh ohh!
Wap!
You ain't got the answers sway!
I could sing all, night
