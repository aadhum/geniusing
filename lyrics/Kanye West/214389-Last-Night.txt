Niggas thought I couldn't rhyme but I tricked 'em
My pulse quickened, I...
Brought myself outta last place, I Michael Vick'd 'em
Niggas thought I let 'em down like Tyson
I got the belt like Lewis
I took these beats, I passed 'em to myself, I'm Kordell Stewart
Back on the corner, back on the block
The Quincy Jones of hip hop
it's my time like Warner
Since I shine like Shyne in '99 with his
Showing the New World, I'mma Order even more of me
So I can live forever like diamonds
Throw your diamonds up
cause almost dying ain't stop me from rhyming
See he'll lie on his dick but won't lie on the stand
So it's time for Kanye to put the Chi on again
I'm the 2003, Do Or D-I-E
They trying to say the best nigga is Twista, then me
It's all R.O.C., it's all family tree
I got that new G5 he got that new Hum-Vee
Incorporate Young Hov and that's The Blueprint 3
And The Blueprint 2 is 3 mil right now
So cut all that, "I don't like Bonnie & Clyde shit out
I almost died
I keep that 2Pac feeling alive
