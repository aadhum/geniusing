[Intro: Woman (Kanye West)]
(First of all, this song right here got...)
You say what is it that you want?
(...a long ass intro)
You got everything that a woman could ever need in life
(you got everything)
You got a closet full of minks, Chinchilla
(You got beats from Kanye)
I got a bureau full of diamonds
(What else ya need?)
I can change four times a day if I want to
You even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne
Now you know that ain't your roots
For you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit
Now you know if anybody know it, I know
But since you feel like that this evening
Sit down (Know what?) and drink some champagne with me
And let me rap to you
You'll never catch me in that baby momma Benz again
I'm pushin' a G5
And ain't never seen him and MCM
Now I don't like fake boobies but I'd do it to Lil' Kim (Yes I would)
We gon' play like Sonny Bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone
She got a lot exposed, pump up the volume
Pump up the volume, dance, dance
'Cause I'm a Gemini with two sides and two rides
Look, I'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore I get that back in
Called Trina and "Do she need that beat tracked again?"
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
Back when Eve went with Steve before she had her weave
I was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe
Back when Foxy had a group with Nas and AZ
The way she looked on Chyna Doll, I woulda did them beats for free
'Cause only recently I been gettin' a decent fee
The checks I got from D-Dot was t-teasin' me
I bought some earrings like, "Baby, that may be fake"
But at least it got girls callin' me 'Babycakes'
Now maybe Kay can get a m√©nage with Lazy K
And Lady May,
See, I came back for you
'Cause any rap chick that look half nice
I'm givin' 'em half price
Send, send headshots first though
I'll be the- I'll be in studio in five minutes
