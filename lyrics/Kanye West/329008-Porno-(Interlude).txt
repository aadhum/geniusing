And then, plus, he, he like porn a lot, so I relate to him with that, you know.
And he been to the AVN's, you know.
I been to the Grammy's,
"Man, I can't do it. I just made 'Jesus Walks'.
They gon' see me, and they gon' take away my NAACP award."
I can't do it, cause they'll take me off the cover of Jet,
Now I won't make it on the cover of Essence.
But one day, one day I'll be there.
I'ma have one on of them BAPE hoodies zipped-up with the eyes cut out and some,
some gloves with the fingers cut off so I could feel, too, so I could touch
You know they let celebrities touch. That's how it be whenever you go to the strip club
"No touching!
Except for you, 'Ye, you can do whatever you want."
