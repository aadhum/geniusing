Wise man say, wise man say
Wise man say
Do you think I sacrificed, real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
Do you think I sacrificed, a real life
For all the fame, and flashing lights
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no Y.S.L. that they could sell
And my mind, out of this jail
To get my heart, out of this hell
There is no clothes that I could buy
That could turn, back in time
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life, I ask you tonight
What does it feel like,What does it feel like
I ask you tonight, What does it feel like
To live a real life
I just wanna be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
Pinocchio's story goes, to be a real boy
I just wanna be a real boy
The funny thing is
Pinocchio, lied, and that's what kept him from it
I tell the truth, and I keep running
It's like I'm lookin out there, tryna find something
I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
So what does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade that no one can really feel
Do you really have the stamina?
For everybody that sees you that say, wait a second "Where's my camera?"
For everybody that sees you, to say sign can you sign a autograph
For everybody that sees you cryin, say you oughta laugh
You oughta laugh!?
There is no Gucci I can buy
There is no Louis Vuitton to put on
There is no vacation spot I could fly
That could bring back, a piece of real life
Real life,Real life
Real life,Real life
Like Pinocchio, they must have lied
Cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
Oh, they must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, 'cause I feel so much love tonight!
They must have lied, lied...
