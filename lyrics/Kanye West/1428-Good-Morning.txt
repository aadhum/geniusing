[Intro]
Uhh.. uhh
Uhh.. uhh
Good morning!
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
I mean damn, did you even see the test?
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
any and every class
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation
Good morning, on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
I'm like the fly Malcolm X, buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league, from an eighth to
a key
From the moments of pain, look how far we done came
Haters saying you changed, now you doing your thang
Good morning!
Good morning, look at the valedictorian
Scared of the future while I hop in the DeLorean
Scared to face the world, complacent career student
Some people graduate, but be still stupid
They tell you read this, eat this, don't look around
Just peep this, preachers, teach us, Jesus
Okay look up now, they done stole yo' streetness
After all of that you received this
(Hustlers that's if you're still living, get on down)
Every time that we hear them
