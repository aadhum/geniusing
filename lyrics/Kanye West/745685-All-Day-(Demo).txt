All day, nigga

This Ye, nigga
Shoppin' for the winter and it’s just May, nigga
Ball so hard, man, this shit cray, nigga
And you ain't gettin' money 'less you got eight figures
For that Jesus piece, man, I've been saved, nigga
Just talked to Farrakhan, that's sensei, nigga
Told him I've been on ten since the 10th grade, nigga
Got a middle finger longer than Dikembe, my nigga, uh

I don't let 'em talk to me no kind of way
Uh, they better watch what they say to me
Niggas still gettin' popped on the day to day

You an actor, you should be on Broadway, nigga
Cause you do shit the broad way, nigga
Your bitch got a ass, but my broad way thicker
Late for the class, in the hallway, nigga

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
All day ho, my neck look sweeter than parfait ho
Rap Derek Jeter in a red two seater
I can throw this dick from far away ho
Swish it, swish it, ask me how long do it take to be the greatest
I'm the broadway ho, swish it, swish it
Damn Kanye never will It be safe, bitch I already know
Swish it, swish it, 24/7 365 days everybody gettin' paid
Nigga lookin' at me like I'm worth both MJ's
These days, don't believe what police say
Only way I can sum it up, son of a bitch
I took a young sweet breath, and I reached into my Earth
Gave him what I had left
At that moment I dispersed
At that moment I dispersed
Little darling, let me run (Let me run)
Until I find myself
In the morning sun
Give me freedom
Give me space
I want to find myself
In this little place
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
Whooooa, whooooa
