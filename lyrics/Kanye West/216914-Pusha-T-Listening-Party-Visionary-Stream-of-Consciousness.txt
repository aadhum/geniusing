This the heart of the muthafuckin city.
Act like y'all ain't have the muthafuckin Clipse album.
Act like y'all ain't based your whole shit your whole lifestyle off this nigga Pusha T.
Pyrex vision, that's Pusha T.
Fear of God, that's Pusha T.
This nigga the heart of the muthafuckin culture, for the culture vultures.
This the only nigga spittin that wild muthafuckin hip hop shit, right now
That's why I stand next to this nigga
. I don't give a fuck about none of these corporations,
This is what the fuck we make. We make good music. We make good music.
We don't give a fuck about how much god damn money you make.
We make good music
I'm a little ... off that Goose right now. I might get loose right now
We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck!
For all the niggas tryna do they camo prints at Magic.
All the niggas tryna extend they t-shirts, tryna throw numbers on the back.
