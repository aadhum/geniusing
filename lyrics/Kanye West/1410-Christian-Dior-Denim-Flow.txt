All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don’t know why I keep calling,
I’m in my Christian Dior with a Veronica Webb
Noemie Lenoir,
Chanel,
Sessilee Lopez
Arlenis Sosa,
Selita Ebanks
Grew up on Mobb Deep, speak that Jourdan Dunn language
Make a phone call out to Joan Smalls
I wonder how it feel to lower Stone's walls?
Jessica Gomes, y'all, I would damage her
I’m in the car with Leo and the Benz swerve
I heard Bar
was friends with Esti Ginzburg
Coco Rocha, Kate Mimosa
Alessandra Ambrosio, Anja Rubik
Get Olga Kurylenko, tell her I’m very single
Abbey Lee too,
I wanna see Irina Shayk
next to Doutzen
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don’t know why I keep calling,
Christian Dior denim flow
I told her I’m trying to eat out
So what we going to dinner for?
Miami nights on the search for some T and A
Trying to hide what’s obvious to see in me
We conversate a bit about your DNA
And my salmon-colored suit from the VMAs
Oh, you was watching? Who the fuck wasn’t?
Me skip across that stage in five dozen,
EGGGHCK
Yeah, six grand for a minute's time
Italian Vogue styled a nigga for a minute rhyme
Let's be clear and let's be fair
The best things in music’s being offered here
It's a round table full of bosses here
Still giving you it all like the coffin's near
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don’t know why I keep calling,
It’s time for a lesson in model behavior
Damn, look at all the bad bitches I gave you
Man, I can see the flaws to your flavor
Look like Wonder Woman and still need a savior
Maybe it's a billionaire,
maybe it's that cocaine
I done seen drugs and money run the whole game
A good girl lost in the city life
Agent Provocateur, hold them titties right
I'm haute couture of hoes galore
Give my girl a Newport 'cause she's smoking yours
I'm the authority of model seniority
They call me Les but they all need more of me
Uh, handcraft material, champagne for cereal
Shorty stole my heart, criminal, my lucky charm
Fly clothes and Lear shows take the stuff we on
Stuff all my problems in that bong and I’m puffing strong
I been locked in my way of thinking, now my cuffs are gone
Must’ve been the liquor talking, I’m begging the cups, c'mon
Might come off as irregular, I come in custom form
T-G-I-F, GT breeze, my hustler’s poem
My sound’s full-grown, reminds me of my favorite chronic (Kush)
Ball like a SuperSonic, make the haters vomit (Uh)
Nigga, make some money ‘fore you make a comment
I meant to snap a while ago, but who knows where the time went?
Prolly dime chicks, whips with a Diddy
Now I’m back like a nine milli, running New York City
See me clearly through the storm
The world’s mine, sits pretty in my palm
Chandon as we continue on
All of these girls at my shows they loving me
But I don’t know why I keep calling,
I could start with just the basics
Dior, Dior galore, I love the cut
I seem to have forgotten that I’m off the looney
To the people who don't know Cud, know what?
Rose gold presidential on my bony wrist
Took my ma to Chanel,
had Elsie the stunner
She got haters, some in the fam made us
But they don’t really matter, we escape them with our paper
Hey ya, I’m on my André 3000
I’m all good now, a nigga don’t need no counseling
Woke up in the room and my mojo was active
Looks from the hoes that were more than likely passive
Back then,
let me not reflect on the old shit
I’m on to the new act, on to my new script
Bitches better have they thoughts before approaching
I done heard it all, baby, save it for them other niggas
Do things off-beat for a living, haters copy, I'm the image
Haters copy, I'm the image
