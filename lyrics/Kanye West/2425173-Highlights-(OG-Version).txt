You've got to get up every morning
You've got to get up every morning
You've got to get up every morning
With a smile on your face
And show the world that you've got love in your heart
That's when I knew hip hop was the new rock
c-cold
Old bitches know I put the dick on they dentures
Might tell 'em Lexington Steele is my mentor
Y'all motherfuckers meant to throw rose like Reddick/Riddick[?]
Might drop a baby line and call that shit Pastel
Bad bitches fuckin' Rob, though he overweight
(I love social media, I love fitness and I love photography)
I need at least seven days with Chloe Sevigny
Since I saw Brown Bunny, it ain't never been the same
Get this thing, iPhone thing
