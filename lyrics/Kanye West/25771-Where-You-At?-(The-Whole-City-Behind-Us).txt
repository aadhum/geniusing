Yeah, yeah - I used to front when I write songs
Talk about havin ice on, and I could barely keep my lights on
And my beats was so sick, I shoulda got a medic
But my credit was so pathetic I couldn't afford a debit
When The Dropout dropped, I had to cop me a money tree
To front on anybody who ever tried to front on me
My life, this year, my career, is the Lord
Bad chick, this award, is for Melyssa Ford
'94 I could only afford this Accord
From the home of gangbangin
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Eastside, right B-Side
Lakeshore Drive
And I'm (and I'm) Chi-Town's finest
Where you at?
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Where you at? The whole city behind us
Southside, outside, Westside, let's ride
Where you at? The whole city behind us
It ain't nuttin to it but to do it!
I came here
To shut the place down 'til my body stops pumpin red fluid
A-Town I've been through it!
And we steady gettin tested
But ready to fill your bubble when we put the lead to it
Ludacris I got silly money - you got jokes?
I'll be laughin all the way to the bank - now that's really funny!
fright nights
Hotlanta home of the booties and the really tight skirts
From Decatur down to CP, and EP
Adamsville to the battlefield it's D.T.P
It's Compton's prodigy
Obviously I'm from the home of hydraulics
Where they tie bandanas around the steerin column
We fightin pitbulls and Rottweilers
In the projects the objective is make dollars
Cause I got a female friend, with frequent flier mileage
I ain't never been to college, got the IQ of a Rhodes Scholar
If you follow G-Unit throw up your dubs and yell holla
Y.G.s
in khakis and white tees
With And 1's in every color like Ice-T
The way I paint pictures with these hip-hop scriptures
Pay attention while The Game shine like a prism
Glisten, show you how canaries can alter one's vision
on behalf
Of Luda and Kanyeezy, I'm gon' breathe easy
