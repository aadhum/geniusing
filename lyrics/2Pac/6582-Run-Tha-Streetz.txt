[Hook: Michel'le]
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
Now peep it
here go the secret on how to keep a playa
Some love makin' and homecookin'
I'll see you later
It don't take a lot to keep a nigga heart
Must be a lady in the light but real freaky in the dark
Plus I got some enemies, baby, hold my pistol
And wrap your arms around a nigga every time I kiss you
Can you visualize the picture, me and you in ecstasy
put your tired head on my chest
A thug nigga's in the house, now you can rest
I bet'cha never screamed a nigga's whole name out
And felt the pleasure and the pain
About to fuck the very taste out your mouth
If you call me when you need me
1-800-skypage, when you wanna see me
But you gotta give a nigga space or you'll drive me crazy
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
Can't make no money in bed
So ain't no future fuckin' you
I ain't the bitch to love ya
9 times outta 10
it's a man's world
But real women make the shit go around
Disrespect and I clown the type of bitch to throw down
My strategy's official
Checkin' ya pockets while I tongue kiss ya
Soft as tissue
So my next issue is 'how to diss you ?'
They call me Storm from the day I was born
I been known to break the coldest motherfucker, 'til his hearts warm
I ain't never been the type to wait at home alone
Just cause we bone
Don't mean you own me
Nigga, I'm grown
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
I'd rather run the streets to make some mail
And put the game down tight
For these gamin' bitches could get it right
Thinkin' I'm new to this, because I'm younger
Nigga, was raised up off of M.O.B
Fetti over something
That's tellin' me don't run the streets
So tell me am I wrong?
For tryin' to communicate through a song
I'm up early in the morning, by sunrise I'll be gone
We hangin' out all night while drinkin' straight liquor
I heard it's poppin' at a club
But they say I can't get in, cause I'm dressed like a thug
Until I die
I'll be game related
Now that we made it
It's a battle just for the big money
I'm livin' wild, no smiles, cause ain't a thing funny
I came up hungry, just a lil' nigga, tryin' to make it
I only got one chance, so I gotta take it
But until then give me love
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
You can run the streets with your thugs
I been waiting for you
Until you get through
I'll be waiting
