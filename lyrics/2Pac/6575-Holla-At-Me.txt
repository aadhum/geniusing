Niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us though
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah

You know, you know who you are
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me

So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside the shoes of a nigga who don't have a thing to lose
When me and you was homies
No one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a nigga's dreams
How could you do me like that?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket, made you a man again
And now you let the fear put your ass in a place
Complicated to escape, it's a fool's fate
Without your word you're a shell of a man
I lost respect for ya, nigga
We can never be friends
I know I'm runnin' through your head now
What could you do?
If it was up to you, I'd be dead now
I let the world know, nigga, you a coward
Ya could never be live
Until you die
Type of nigga, that let the evil of the money trap me
When ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me (holla at me)
Gotta be afraid, donâ€™t let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
So I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I got shot up, I surprised the niggas the way I got up
And then I hit the studio, it's time to blow the block up
This information got you contemplatin'
and let him see the face of a mental patient
I want members that call the fifty states
To keep the nation anticipatin' until we break
So be prepared, cause only the strong survive
Life isn't fair (fair)
Probably never knew the way it feels to die
So you see come fuck with me, I give that ass a try!!
Nigga, holla at me
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
And now I gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I should've saw the signs, I was blinded
So many brothas framed in this dirty game
It's a shame, so much pressure on my brain while she blame me
Secrets in the dark, only her and I know
Now I'm sittin' in the state pen', doin' time slow
Guess she made a bad decision
That got me livin' just like an animal
I'm caged up in state prison
My niggas dissin' cause
hell hath no fury like a woman's scorn
A cemetery full of motherfuckers not knowin'
Picture my prophecy
I got some attacking me, on top of me
I'm runnin' from the coppers
Cause I'm a soldier
Hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies of one day getting older
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
A nigga gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me, nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Niggas out there jealous cause we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate, but they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through the neighborhood, yeah
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
Gotta be careful, can't let the evil of the money trap me
So when ya see me nigga, you better holla at me
You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay
