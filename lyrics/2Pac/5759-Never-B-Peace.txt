Now of course I want peace on the streets, but realistically
Paintin' perfect pictures ain't never worked,
my misery
Was so deep, couldn't sleep through all my pressures
In my quest for cash I learned fast, usin' violent measures
Memories of adolescent years, there was unity
But after puberty, we brought war to our community
So many bodies droppin', it's gotta stop,
I wanna help
But still I'm steppin', keep my weapon, must protect myself
Plus my teachers was too petrified in class to teach me
Sippin' Thunderbird and grape Kool-Aid,
callin' Earl
Since my stomach was empty it seduced me to fuck the world
Watch my lil' homies lose they childhoods to guns
Nobody cries no more,
So why you ask me if I want peace if you can't grant it?
Niggas fightin' across the whole planet
So it could never be peace
My dawgs got frabies, they bitin' each other
Bigfully is a bullet and he don't mind dyin'
Time after time after time after time
Dawg, we livin' in a prison, losin' our religion
On Thanksgivin' we thankful, just for livin' in Hell
Damn, homie, I don't mean to be harsh
But there's a devil in the ghetto tryin' to tear it apart
And if we make it up out, we still stuck in the dark
And I know there'll never be peace (never)
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets
‘Cause there'll never be peace
Niggas buyin' guns, loadin' 'em up, aimin' at each other
And the victim is you and me, it's sick, but it's true indeed
The good die, mostly over bullshit, repeatedly
Askin' God to point out the impostor
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper
‘Cause there'll never be peace, so don't rely on it, soldiers dyin' for it, and in the ghetto, they cryin' for it. But fuck peace!
You motherfuckers are smilin', but I'm mean muggin'
It seems drugs done turned this whole mothafuckin' hood out
All us niggas actin' up, wild-ass motherfuckin' adolescents
And you at the funeral every motherfuckin' weekend?
