And I ain't West Coast for these niggas on the West huh?
I want motherfuckin' police tryin' to pull niggas over on this one
I got my Hennessy find ya foes
In a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm gettin' high off buddha cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough you never find me broke
And who me? A nigga livin' life like a G
In that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep livin' in these wicked times, peep
Niggas after me cause they see I'm stackin' G's and heat
You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
Quentin
Down on Rikers Isle
Stay rile
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
These, niggas don't know my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Bitch-made ass niggas don't know my style
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
from makin' niggas duck from Glocks
I'm still rollin' my bucket but I bought me a Benz
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
Cause in the dark see they hearts full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
Only me inside the cell, straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucker screamin' like the demon's inside
I cry, but in my own way
Cemetery full of brothers I buried it's goin' down
Even now I wonder will I still be around
My hometown is the gutter I was born a wild
I came up out this dust with my heartless style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Uptown
Listenin' to Mr. Magic
Cuttin' up the hits
And even though I had a habit
Makin' words rhyme I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
And Pete and Lee young G's
Remember mama's cookin', no school straight hookin'
And tryin' to get with light skinned cause she good lookin'
And jumpin' over turnstiles cause we ain't payin'
Call the cuties cuss words but we only playin'
'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot cause my moms was stuck
Had to move to the West to regain my style
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the cross, but my force was wild
Quick to smile, juvenile, was a problem child
Try to put me in the mothafuckin' cross, but my force was wild
