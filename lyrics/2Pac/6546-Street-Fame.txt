Turn it up in my head phones, please
Comin' to a ghetto near you, street fame
More, ha ha, comin' to a ghetto near you
I wasn't mad until these tricks shot me
It's time I sanitize my posse
Look how paranoid these niggas got me
Cellular calls are being traced
since surveillance silently
Mama, chill, thug livin' pay the bills, I'm dyin' violently
Closed caskets,
expose bastards, I leave 'em bloody
Delores Tucker, don't let your kids
Hear a nigga speak on gettin' money
Ain't nothin' funny, green got a nigga seein' things
Why? Hit the lye, hope to God I can fly
Lethal weapon, I'm a savage; still a method to my madness
Blast niggas, laugh, call 'em care cabbage
Read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep, they hell bound
Lyrics will leave 'em spell bound
Clown, now tired of being held down
Cross my heart, hope to die,
Millionaire, livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me
Spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me
Bust until my rounds empty;
All out warfare, eye for a eye
Bustin' on my enemies, bad boy killin'
Straight dissin' you
Fuck Lil' Kim, you nasty bitch!
Temperatures rises,
niggas blinded by my lyrical disguise
No time to plot retreats, niggas shiver and die
Criminal tactics, the rap game became so drastic
Military mind,
wagin' war for years
speakin' freely
Conversatin' with my comrades kickin' Swahili
Currency in stacks, artillery in the back
When we attack, holla out my set, nigga
Tighten your jaw,
street fame
Only Makaveli the Don
Can put it down like this; ain't none like me
their plan busted, no man to be trusted
Everything corrupted once man touch it
Kamikaze,
hopin' that none of the spies find me
Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day, hey!
Ain't nothin' strange, I'm 25, dyin' to change
But still I bang wantin' street fame
Makaveli the Don
Representin' the Outlawz, street fame
Makaveli the Don,
Killuminati
Got you taking more fuckin' shorts than gettin' props
Then that lifestyle need to stop
Best to recognize some Outlaw shit
â€˜Cause only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to
To see what this life's supposed to be like
Nigga, you'll start to see riches
Fine bitches and hittin' switches
Shit, to me that shit sound delicious; street fame
