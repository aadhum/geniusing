Straight outta Oakland, California
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
Shootin' craps in the alley 'til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies, but don't waste it all
Ooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
slow jam
Lookin' dumb, cause you waitin' for your chance to hump
And it's cool, 'til a fool pull a loaded gun
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin' here longer what that tell ya?
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
[Verse 3]
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers gettin' rich slangin' crack to folks
And the square's gettin' big for these sack of dope
'Til the dealer on the block told me, "That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
I got my game about women from a prostitute
I couldn't make it in school,
so finally I dropped out
