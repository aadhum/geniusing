Now I been called crazy, to fade me it's not possible
I give a fuck, what you thought, or who you brought witchu?
They wonderin' why he breathin', but bitches is dyin' later
Better laugh now, then cry when I come to get you
Mr., Makaveli movin' pieces like telekinesis
It's like a chess game, let's play wit' real pieces
Shots rang and niggas brains was spilled
Another Bad Boy affiliator nigga was killed
I hit the funeral and bust at his folks
And leave the scene like a shadow in a blaze of smoke
