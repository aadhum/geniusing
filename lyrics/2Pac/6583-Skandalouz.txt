Hey Nate, you know you got the vocals on this motherfucker
We finna talk about these scandalous hoes
Daz on the beat
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, never breathin' again
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous
How's it hangin'? Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin'
I've been stressing in this ghetto game, trying to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin'
This bitch'll have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin', as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a bitch who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you saying?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggas can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin' for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't fuck with your punk crew
Busting at niggas who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm tokin' free on the highway, formulatin' plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous
Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the ho be
You ever peep that shit? (Nah)
A bitch can be like 15, fucking with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for everything
Hoes these days is way too motherfucking intelligent
When these niggas get to tricking, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, 'bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggas out there
Beware these lying ass scandalous bitches
