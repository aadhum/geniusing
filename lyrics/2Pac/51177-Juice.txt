I'm out the gutter,
I'm 165 and staying high til I die
my competion's zero
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
[2Pac]

This nigga is scared

[Big L]

Ain nobody scared man I just told you how to do this anymore

[2Pac]

Fuck that shit

You're goin Saturday night and that's it
You see Corleone, ice spinnin', jigged out, white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cuz yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now, nigga, leave the game
'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain
We're thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Hustlers flip cokey,
48 Hours like Nick Nolte
It's all about the Benjis So why your bills got Washington's face?
A lot of cats be frontin'
Mad singles wit' a fifty on top
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cuz they really were hot
Rap game, heavy hitters, it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggas wanna be L, ladies wanna see L
If I go to jail you'll wear a shirt sayin' "Free L!"
Oh shit
Yo be careful with that man it's loaded
I'll hold on to the gun
Why should he hold on to the gun?
Cuz I already got it motherfucker!
A killer fiends for blood, screams of thugs like
Fiends for drugs, I don't need no love
Get your calculator, go 'head Decapitator's back forever
Can't count how many heads I had to sever
And make a truss out her flesh, like Buffalo Bill
Yo you got the juice now
Made it ma ... made it ma
Top of the world [top of the world] top of the world
destiny in his own hands
