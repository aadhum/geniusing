My seductive introduction be specific
Still elusive,
Just a ghetto star, a drop top double-R is what I'm ridin'
Nigga, if you was half the man your bitch was
Bring yo' artillery when you come for me, ‘cause we sick thugs
Bo
So now I got the law on me
My phone's tapped So I had to send word through my lil' homies
For real, it's how I feel
Reflect my thoughts, flowin' on these reels
We still cool, but you played yourself
Give him the MAC and make him spray hisself, heyyy
Fallin' legends clutchin' chrome three-five-seven
Puttin' two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in Heaven
Tried to rise, but they tried me
I guess they all had to die, ‘cause we tried peace
I die in these streets
Blast 'til they recognize
For lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
"Buck buck" was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby, bring the black hearse
