Bitch I'm a playa got no time to be bothered with
Havin' no babies in no long term relationships
Because a bitch will be a bitch no matter what you say
That's why I fuck 'em, bust a nut, and I'm on my way
Soon as I finish I'll be glad I even fucked a whore
Cause she'll be blowin' up my beeper before I shut the door
But fuck a bitch I keep my mind on my drink cause yo
That's how I'm livin' in the days, of a criminal
