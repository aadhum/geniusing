I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
But sayin' "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Bad Boy niggas eat a dick a day
So wicked that my tracks is wettin' niggas like it's water
My after time is narrow, peepin' down the barrel of a foe
Let me modify this whole region
