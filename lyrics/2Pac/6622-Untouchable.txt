You motherfuckers kill me
Why yall niggas don't ever talk that shit when we be in the physical form?
Why yall niggas get all shy when we right there next to you at the premiere's and shit?
Hahaha
Outlaw
Expect me nigga like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I'm comin'
After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again
Visions of over packed prisons
millions of niggas thug living
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em
We Outlawz rushing you busting you
We untouchable
Since he disappeared, I still ain't found peace in it
