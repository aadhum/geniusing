[Intro: 2Pac]
Stand in formation, my motherfuckin' real troopers
Say what? (Eastside, Westside ride) Where ya at, where ya at?
Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme
Introduce a drug called crack to us ghetto teens
When will niggas see they got us bleedin' with three strikes
Got these Devils petrified, hidin' from my hocus-pocus
and over time
Affiliated
clearly click a military mind
May God forgive us though we dwell inside a paradox
Thugged out and drug dealin', from the womb to the block
My live mind got me survivin' five rounds (shots)
My forty-five got me fortified with live rounds
When shit's thick we plot hits, when our Glock spits
All hail, out on bail, wrath of the 2Pacalypse
food stamps
never left the boot camp
Skills in guerilla warfare and blessed with refinement
My rap sheet, contains sections of bomb sessions
Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined
Man to man, I'm facin' the Devil with a plan
Judo stance, first glance, I'm makin' my advance
Animal instincts, intelligence of an assassin
Is to stay true to self, in this case, BDI
Takin' breathin' techniques, slay you with Tai-Chi
duck and down
Cause my moms used to smoke back in the 70's
When I ease across the block with 'Pac
Got all y'all niggas shocked
You didn't think Boot Camp Clik would link, with a Outlaw mind?
guerilla tactics
Fuck what you heard
From the ghetto to the 'burbs, know we meant, every word
