By age sixteen I sold to dope fiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me
I got the feds wonderin' who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gun smoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin' diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon
Niggas trippin' homey, when we ridin'?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for
M.O.B
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a ballin' cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
rocks
Cops
Spot Watt niggas but hardly stop niggas
I'm for respect nowadays
they expect me
To be in a Ferrari or the old SL
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin' with a changed man)
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin' through coastin'
M.O.B.! Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
Number 1 in the nation
You go and drink the Henn' up
You fuckin' with a changed man
You go and drink the Henn' up
You fuckin' with a changed man
