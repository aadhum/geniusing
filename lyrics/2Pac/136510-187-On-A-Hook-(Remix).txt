West side, it's 187 on a motherfucking hook
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
HEEY!
Got some static for some niggas on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
Niggas makin' songs, tryin' to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed,
in the West we trust
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk mezzole not only bust that rhyme
"Allah hu akbar" - is what I say before I buck you
Motherfuck busters like vell Bacardi yeah nigga had enough you
Get ready to suffer - kneel down
Nigga,
Tech N9ne Killer Klown
six feet underground is where your found
Nigga, 40 water would never did a song wit you if he knew the song
Was about me never make a million
Next time say my name say my name like destiny's children - bitch
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
Watch my eyes - when I pull the trigger
Now dry your eyes, you was heartless on your hits
Niggas love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!
Don't fuck with me!
Nigga you're barely livin', don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin' well, hell
See I was only talkin' to Biggie
But I'll kill all'a y'all, then ball
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin' Outlawz
Deep navis with heat like the A team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
