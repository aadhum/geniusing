It seems we got a problem
We ain't lettin' no women and the feminine side
Has been denied time to give 'em a try
Finally made it, now focus
I agree, it's a man's world, but why must niggas diss us
I ain't tryin' to hear it, witness my thug spirit
I love you niggas like brothers, but don't fuck with me
double Glocks
We Outlawz
Now when I say Pig
You say B-I-G
When I say Bad Boy killer
Then you say me
I wrote this shit while fuckin' Big's wife
[Storm]
Now I been told that Lil Kim thinks she hot

[2Pac]
She not
Plus now Da Brat's trippin'
We be the first ones to fuck with you and Bad Boy, weak bitch
Bustin' through Brooklyn, lickin' my shots to Queens
'Cause I'm lookin' for Little Shawn, that bitch ass fiend
I made him scream like last year
Best don't come to California, we don't want your busta ass here
But watch me bust on LL
Death Row, west side
