Now up and at 'em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And mama told me be a thug, since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is, nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin' from the gun yellin' "One time!"
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
I'm gettin' high, so a nigga think, he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin' life as a thug, time to face the truth
What's goin' on with the wasted youth, please God
Come and save me, had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin' crazy
I can't read the signs
I'm blind, but a nigga know he need his
nine
Cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
And my niggas on the streets
Cause these ain't the old days
I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin' lace, niggas with the game
Wanna see me locked in chains, tryin' to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin' me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin'
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
Raise 'em up
I wrote this for my critics and my enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh, remember me
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin' to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin' sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin' to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a livin' hell
they got my phone tapped
And mercy Lord, come get me 'fore they hurt me
My daddy left me alone and so I'm angry
I never did nothin' wrong, my mama told me, "Baby, it's on!"
And now I'm hustlin' and bustlin' bones
I'm makin' cheese
Buyin' all the things on TV
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin' middle finger
Raise 'em up
Took four years and a motherfuckin' case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
