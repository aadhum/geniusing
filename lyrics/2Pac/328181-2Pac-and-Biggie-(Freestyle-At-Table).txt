[Intro: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Ready nigga? Ready for that raw dog shit nigga?
Okay, Alright
Let me see how im gonna hit you with
I'm scared to do some freestyle flow
I'm too high and I might go of tempo
I keep a motherfucking Glock in my car
they wanna see
If Pac is real or is he like that nigga in the movie
now I'm doing the joint
And my other homies out here like Spike Lee
But now I'm bout to pass this motherfucker on
Cause this Tanqueray is getting hella strong
[Verse 2: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Money, hoes and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose is all a nigga knows
Flippin' on foes, puttin' tags on toes
if she don't suck then we don't fuck
A fly guy, well fuck it I'ma high guy from Bed-Stuy
Puttin' the swellin' on your eye
And your nose even
And when police come, I'm leavin'
