They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces,
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless
I'm chokin off
Marijuana smoke
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Everybody's dyin am I next
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Is there a heaven for a baller?
I'm gettin suspicious
Of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
Can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
