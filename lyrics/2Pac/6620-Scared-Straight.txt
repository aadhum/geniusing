Prepare for the wrath, a psychopath when this song play
Get iller than Johnny Gill, then rub you the wrong way
Fuck sensitivity I get cruel when you're doing me
Cause none of the rough stuff bitch stop pursuing me
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (Ah, yeah, scared straight)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
You scared motherfucker you scared?
I know you scared motherfucker you scared (When your heart's beating)
Cause I can hear your heart beating, heavy breathing
I can see the sweat, trickling from your head
Fucking with the ginger juice the booze of fucking Hennessy
The closer they can get
But still don't let them see me sweat
'Til they get a load of the bold ass 2Pacalypse
Hitting him with the flurry, I'll bury him if he steps to me
