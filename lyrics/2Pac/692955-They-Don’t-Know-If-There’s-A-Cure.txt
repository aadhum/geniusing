Aye, we doin' this for the fans
For the motherfuckers that be in our corner
This right here is some live shit
Ain't one word written down
Ain't no words from my mind
This is the shit right off the level
This how we do it
Cause most of the time, what niggas like
Niggas know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G (no they don't)
They don't know oh-oh-oh
I say they swear they know me!!!
But they don't know the D-O-double-G (ha ha)
They don't know oh-oh-oh
My niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh
I say my niggas down with me!!!
Until the day I d-i-e-e-e
You ho's know oh-oh-oh
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it, I don't need it (biatch)
And if there's a cure for this
I don't need it, I don't want it
I'm up early in the mornin', tryin' to get paid
Cause my mind's on my money, everything is so made
Just movin' on paper; movin', makin' and shakin'
Leavin' fools in a daze, as if, I was a Laker
They don't want it
Cause they screamin' they "Can't C Me"
You heard the album, All Eyez On Me
I know you heard the album, I Ain't Mad at Cha (mad at cha)
So move closer, big baby, let me stab at cha (stab at cha)
You know the rules,
Big 'Pac in this motherfucker
Don't look at me crazy, cause baby I ain't with them other suckers (suckers)
This Thug Life, baby, Outlaw Immortalz
I thought I taught you
And when we did, we beat you ass niggas in the streets
To the motherfuckin' studio
Soundin' like Phil Collins, singin' su-su-sudio
You niggas is booty
It's like a family
Corleone style (Corleone), or mafioso (Outlaw)
Snoop Dogg 'bout to do it like Mussolini slow
E.D.I. what up nigga? I see you, I feel you real now
Snoop Dogg 'bout to show how you, how I peel the crowd
I step back, relax
