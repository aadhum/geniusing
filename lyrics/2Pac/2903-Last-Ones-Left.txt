Nigga, westside!
Westside in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker
Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin'
Screaming, "Outlaw!", runnin' on the curb
Livin' like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi,
nigga, watch me with the chrome 9
All the time drinkin' champagne
Picture me doin' 80, down a one-way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gunplay
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
Guess I'm the last one left
Prior to war is a rider nigga that's only 5'6" tall
Napoleon only knows on we Outlaws, fuck fear
Thug passion all up in me, feelin' like I took some Henny
they think 'Pac died, nigga
Blast niggas with our TEC's,
takin' showers in our vest
Or puffin' on a sweet Swisher
Like I'm the last one left
And I know it ain't right, but it's the life I got
And that's until I see Yak, and that's until I see 'Pac
I'd stick my dick in the ground; fuck the world!
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker…
Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here
Outlawz in this motherfucker
Westside in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker…
Uh, Outlaw in this motherfucker right here
Westside in this motherfucker
In this motherfucker right here…
