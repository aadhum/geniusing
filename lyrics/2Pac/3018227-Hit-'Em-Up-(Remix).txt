[Chorus (Anno Domini Beats)]:
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
First off, fuck your bitch and the clique you claim
Westside when we ride, come equipped with game
You claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife
We bust on Bad Boys, niggas fucked for life
Plus Puffy trying to see me, weak hearts I rip
Biggie Smalls and Junior M.A.F.I.A. some mark-ass bitches
We keep on coming while we running for your jewels
Steady gunning, keep on busting at them fools
You know the rules
Lil' Caesar go ask your homie how I'll leave you
Cut your young ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Little Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch your ugly ass off the streets
So fuck peace! I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride the night haha
Bad Boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and get your caps peeled
You know

[Hook: 2Pac]
See, grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac, oh
Who shot me, but your punks didn't finish
Now you about to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, I hit 'em up
[Verse 2: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go; Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow
Fuck no! Go for broke, his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as befo'
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
And establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin'
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up outta of our mouths
Now rewind it – pay back, motherfucker
For the way that you got at me, how's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter
So just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake… (this place so Drake)
[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
We be
The best of CG
Greedy
Abduct the PD
See me?
Nigga, not in 3D
Be me?
Hah, it's not easy
I'm breezy
And off the heezy
Me and my woman's like George & Wheezy
Movin' on up, niggas use to tease me
See me on top
It makes you queasy
Sick with it
Bitch, I'm Bruce Lee
Seduce me
You're nice and juicy
In the parking lot, I gots to get mine
Why the fuck we goin' in when there's bitches in line?
I spend my time watchin' bitches' behinds
Thinkin' bad shit in the back of my mind
I bump and grind with nothing less than a dime
Making movie money, you still investin' in rhymes
