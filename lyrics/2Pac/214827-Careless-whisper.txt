I'm never gonna dance again, hahahaha thats right
Guilty feet have got no rhythm sucka for love
Though it's easy to pretend
I know you're not a fool, a sucka for love

Should've known better than to cheat a friend
And waste the chance that I've been given, a sucka for love
So I'm never gonna dance again
The way I danced with you
