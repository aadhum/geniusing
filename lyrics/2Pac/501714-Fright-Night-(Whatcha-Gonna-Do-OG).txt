Listening to the radio, wishing that I could rap
Got a player in the court room, please don't let 'em frame me
look at all this green I'm holding
Hoping the heavenly father love a hustler
Me, Makaveli, I'm a motherfucker
We break bread, now we thug brothers
Change a nigga's future like a schizophrenic palm reader
