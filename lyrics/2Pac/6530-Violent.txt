They claim that I'm violent
Just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits
â€™Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
Envious because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self defense
But when the shit gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
You wanna censor somethin', motherfucker censor this!
"They claimin' that I'm violent"
"Fuck the damn cop!"
The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"
He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
Givin' him a taste, of trading places
peckerwood
Now they claimin' that I'm violent
As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (Damn!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the fuck outta here.)
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
So here we go, the police against us
(What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care
Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent
