[Intro: Richie Rich & 2Pac]
It's time for me to uhhh regulate
And you ain't going back?
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
I ain't begging
trying to relocate between your legs
as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me
and now
You straight begging to sex me got you undressing to test me and uhh..
Your fantasies come alive
your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
so give this thug a try
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see you blushing like you want something, come get a taste
Amerikaz Most Wanted
a drop top, 500 Benz
You can ride out with spoke coke,
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
That I's the nigga and spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep you on the sidelines
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
Them busters ain't loving you right
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got you naked
I'm so into you
witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know
Now scream my name out
do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss player, freaky motherfucker,
let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stressed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold the boots, and let a nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm going home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You're in the presence of a player, I'd rather be ya nigga
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
