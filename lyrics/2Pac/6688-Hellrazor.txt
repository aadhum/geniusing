Major! Hell motherfuckin' yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Cooley, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellraiser
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary and cuttin' classing
I keep my finger on the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya
gettin major
Why you let the police beat down niggas
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Thug Life motherfucker,
duck quick
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
Now I'm screamin fuck the world,
It's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
Stressin' like a motherfuckin' drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die
