When your heart turns cold
I say, when your heart turns cold
It causes your soul to freeze
It spreads, throughout yo' spirit
The walls, the walls that once were down
Now stand firm and tall, safe from hate love pain joy
Death death death seems like tranquility
Sleeping is never pleasant
If you even sleep at all all all
