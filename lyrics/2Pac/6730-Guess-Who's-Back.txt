Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
Two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press REC on your deck
Here we go, set? Pass the MoÃ«t
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
bootleggers tryin' to rob me!
catch wreck
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, "Hi,"
I went from hustlin dicks to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
cause they hate my black tape
No longer trapped
