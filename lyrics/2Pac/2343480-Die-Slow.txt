Jay Z, come out to play
Hey yo Assassin, gimme one of them tracks I can just ride on motherfuckers
With
Mobb deep
Come hell or high water
Down to slaughter opposes
Brandish my strap. black like a cobra
I stay drunk. cause I'm a MADMAN. whenever sober
While I pluck holes in niggas like donuts
bringin' war to the city
I take the figue of thirty niggas who all got me
I'm screamin DEATH ROW. throwin' westside. ain't no thing
We was raised off driveby's. brought up to bang
We claim mob. MOB. if you be specific
JAY Z, DEAD IN
THE DUST

BUST ON ALL Y'ALL, GOIN' ALL OUT
