See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasing me around
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wanting more
There ain't nothing like tryin' to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
The chickenheads wanna play with me
You getting mad, ‘cause you think I'ma sway
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be getting lonely for you
I'm coming home soon as I make this pay, make this pay
Wonder if you feel me from far away, and can you hear me?
And there's no way I'ma stop making money
‘Cause your attitude's changed and you're acting a little funny
Always complaining, saying we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
Thugs get lonely too, you know
I sit alone in my room, drinking without a care
You're the first face I wanna see when I get home
Touching every wall in the house, thug style
And thugs get lonely too, you know
Yeah, thug life, baby! Steady thuggin'
Aye, so you remember that
Next time you sweating me when I'm on the road, baby
Thugs get lonely too
We ain't gotta go through all this bullshitting ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me
