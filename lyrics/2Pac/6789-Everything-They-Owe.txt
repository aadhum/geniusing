[Intro: 2Pac]
Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin'
Claimin' that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
But supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin' at my innocent family, say they lookin' for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin' bout, "Where is the quaaludes?" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed "Nigga motherfucker"
Dropped me to my knees, I proceed to bleed
Sufferin' a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin'?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option
God damn!
Now they got me goin' to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin' this in federal prison, givin' everything I owe
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
I'm comin' collectin' the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin' and duckin'
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin'
