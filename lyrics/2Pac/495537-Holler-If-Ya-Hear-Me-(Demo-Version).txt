The government is getting shadier
Shoulda learned when them OGs trashed Watts
And you can say no to drugs, but you can’t say no to the thugs with slugs
If you’re gonna preach about "turn the other cheek" you can keep it
They beating brothers in the streets and you’re talkin’ bout peace
Instead of an army we was marching and chanting;
“We shall overcome
