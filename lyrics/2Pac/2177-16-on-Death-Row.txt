Death Row, that's where mothafuckas is endin' up
Dear Mama,
I'm caught up in this sickness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch?
Should I shoot his bitch or make the nigga rich
Hawkin' while I'm walkin' and talkin' behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
‘Cause life's a Wheel of Fortune, here's my chance to spin it
Niggas gettin' jealous, tryin' to find my stash
Whip out the 9, now [?] pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these mites
I listened to his screams, until he went insane
I guess the little mites had finally found his brain
Remember that little bird? He snitched and told a friend
And fuck five-0! Blaow, blaow! Turn 'em into forty-niners
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row
Dear Mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, ‘cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me,
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
The brother in my cell is 16 as well
They made me an animal, can't sleep
Instead of countin' sheep, niggas countin' cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
tell the Lord to make way for me
Prepare any day for me
(Why?)
‘Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
I found my buddy hangin' dead from a rope;
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row
Dear Mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin' every breath
I'm bitter ‘cause I'm dying, so much I haven't seen
I got beef with a sick society
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God
About the crimes he's committin' on the poor
I never got to be a man,
Steer clear of these Aryan mothafuckas
‘Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin' shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I would've known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin' for the chair
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin' like a thief, runnin' through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go
Where they find me; 16 on Death Row
