Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
Duckin' one-time (lost soul)
How it start, how it start?
Started off with runnin' from coppers, duck and hide from helicopters
We open fire, who can stop us?
Livin' the life of trife juveniles, hopin' for Rikers
Gettin' 25 to life if the judge don't like us
In my clearest pictures, I see authorities itchin' to get us
ATF state Feds, scandalous bitches
How was it promised to us, wasn't bitter or sweet
See, if a nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
On these streets livin' do or die circle complete
Repetitive motions of felons in a rush for G's
Please, understand my history, a man of many hats
Livin' Thug Life, comin' equipped with plenty gats
Maybe I was just a lost soul, trapped in time
Livin' in between life, in the cracks, but blind
Even though we have hope for dreams that never came
Yet and still we all feel pain
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
â€˜Cause I hate to spend my life, my life, my life, my life
In Thugs I Trust
my stack's fat
poisonous womb
Heroin being consumed already predictin' my doom
Just wait until rain turn to sunshine
All of y'all, keepin y'all in hell
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in Hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To all of y'all, keepin' y'all in Hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
For all my dogs, keepin' y'all in hell
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
