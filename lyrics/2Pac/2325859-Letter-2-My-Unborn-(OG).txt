My momma was a Panther loud
single parent
but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?
Livin' my life as an Outlaw what could be worse?
I'm a rider, mane
