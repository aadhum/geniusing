[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin' Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brandish my strap,
back like a cobra
I stay drunk, ‘cause I'm a mad man whenever sober
On a one-man mission, my ambition's to hold up
The rap game, while I pluck holes in niggas, like donuts
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers
Quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question who's sane
then transform, watch me
I take the figure of 30 niggas who all got me
While bitches wonderin' who shot me
No love, keep a grudge
Shootin' slugs like Muammar Gaddafi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin' shots at paparazzi
Go and fly now, nigga, like Rocky
Another gay rapper, bustin' caps at Jay Z
(Buck buck buck buck buck!)
And still avoid capture
While y'all caught up in the rapture, still after me
I'm in Jamaica, sippin' daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin' nothin'
Then grabbin' somethin' and bustin'
Wanted to be the thug nigga that my old man wasn't
I can't tour, fear of catchin' cases, litigation
I'm screamin', "Death Row!"
Throw my Westside, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-bys, brought up to bang
We claim mob,
M.O.B., if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this: I'm hard to kill
when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive these five shots?
Live it up or give it up, and like demons
Late night, hear them screamin', "We goin' all out!"
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
I'm on my last leg, walkin' through the belly of the beast
It's a shame how some niggas on the West Coast
Was ridin' with 'Pac, but when he died they went pop
But after 'Pac stopped rappin', it ain't no West Coast thug
‘cause rappers like Jay Z be pumpin' Kool-Aid through they veins
Slap your soft ass to the floor
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
Tattooed up, and now them niggas swearin' they 'Pac
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
I pray to thug lords
We goin' all out, bomb first 'til they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle your own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga, go all out
Bustas playin' with your papes better go all out
Tryna see the next day, nigga, go all out
Obstacles in your way, you better go all out
Aye, you niggas just gon' think you gon' be uhh
Talkin' slick on all of these motherfuckin' records
And we ain't gon say shit
Now it's 1999,
