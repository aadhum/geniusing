Starin' at the world through my rearview
Just lookin' back at the world
From another level, you know what I mean? Starin'
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
I wonder when the world stopped carin'
Last night two kids shot while the whole block starin'
I will never understand this society
First they try to murder me,
then they lie to me
Product of a dyin' breed;
all my homies tryin' weed
Now the little babies crazed, raised off Hennessy
Tell me, will my enemies flee when they see me?
Believe me, even thugs gotta learn to take it easy
And we turnin' bad boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggas in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga
Rollin' with a posse full of paranoid drug dealers
To the end, my friend
I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
See, I'm seein' nothin' but my dreams comin' true
While I'm starin' at the world through my rearview
Now you see him, now you don't
Some niggas be here for the moment, and then they gone
What happened to 'em?
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch,
Who is gonna catch me when I fall or even care to?
But still we keep mashin' until our dreams come through
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a 12 gauge pump for protection
Heavenly Father, I'm a soldier
I'm gettin' hotter 'cause the world's gettin' colder
Baby, let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run, look at my bitches!
[Verse 3: Kadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for Glocks
'Cause fiends hittin' up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin' rules to these streets
Somethin' I learned in school
On some Million Man March shit for the piece
We all die, breed, bleed like humans
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin' my dough
So while you reminiscin' all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin' through your rearview
Once a motherfucker get an understandin' on the game, and what the levels and the rules of the game is, then the world ain't no trick no more, the world is a game to be played.
It's all about the papers, money rule the world.
Bitches make the world go round.
Real niggas do what they wanna do, bitch niggas do what they can.
