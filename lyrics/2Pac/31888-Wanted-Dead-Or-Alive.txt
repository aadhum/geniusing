Nuthin' but a gangsta party
Nuthin' but a gangsta party
Got me up against the fence, back against the wall
Get to actin' like a fool if ain’t no justice for the Dogg
It's a gangsta party so, Bad Boy gettin' buried
When we ride it’s a must adversaries die every time
not $hort but Snoop Dogg
A Teflon Don to this hip-hop game, super supreme
It's so hard to stay focused on my eyes and prize
But if I don't, the Dogg won't survive
Still creepin bump through the hood, always involved in the streets
Now take a look through the eyes of a G
holler if you hear me
my nigga 2Pac rest in peace
Yeah yeah, stay down
Gangstas gangstas
Foe life, Eastside!
Westside of the coast
Yeah, Eastside!
Mmmm, for all my soldiers
Yeah
Where ya at?
Yeah
