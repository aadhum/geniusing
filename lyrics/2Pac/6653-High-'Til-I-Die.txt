High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
Loced 'Til they smoke me
Game rules, ain't got time for fools
Money on my mind, so my nine rules
Time to, make weight, niggas gettin' crazy paid
And hatin' bitches for the games they play
So nigga, pull quick
But better be quicker than the next, motherfucker on the, trigger
Cause I'm static
Startin' to be a fuckin' havoc gotta keep my automatic, or get my ass kicked
When I'm in traffic, it's kinda rough and, I drive a bucket
Live the Thug Life nigga screaming, fuck it
I love to throw my middle finger to the police
And no bucks, no justice, no peace
I'm smokin' blunts 'til I pass out (coughing)
Yeah, nigga, gettin' assed out
Rollin' in my nigga's glass house
Drivin' fast, talkin' to bitches, whippin' cash out
I'm with my niggas, so fuck the suckers, I'm buckin the busters
Smokin' chronic motherfuckers causin' ruckus
It's the last of the drank, pull over
Can't hear a damn thing sober
High 'Til I Die
Loced 'Til they smoke me
The Shit don't stop
Til my casket drop
Loced 'Til they smoke me
Lord help me save me
Mama keep prayin' for a young motherfucka
Tryin' to duck an early grave
In the city where you can't tell the fakes from the snakes
Enemies from phonies, friends from your homies
Hey, what's up with bitches tryin' to screw me
Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me
But before they never knew me
