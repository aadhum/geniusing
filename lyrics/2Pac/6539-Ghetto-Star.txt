Niggas is so ashamed they stand stiff like scared bitches
While I remain inside a paradox called my block
Though gunshots is promised to me, when will I stop?
I hit the weed and hope to God I can fly high
Witness my enemies die when I ride by, they shouldn't have tried
I send they bodies to they parents up North
With they faces, they wrists, and they nuts cut off
Fuck 'em all what I scream as I dream in tongues
Fuck a trick, get me rich and the bitches'll come
Bust my gun, make 'em all scatter
Bullets to my nuts only made my balls fatter
Laced with game, practice on takin' pain
Quick to slang, and let it rain through yo' brain
Movin' niggas with telekinesis
And hope niggas got punished
Kidnapped, jacked in the back with MAC's to they neck,
rappers waitin to get done in
Walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to my homies that was buried
See my enemies wanna see me dead, I ain't worried
Please give me shelter, calm my fears
Lifted my head, from my hands, had a palm of tears
Why, I heard the Feds had a warrant for my ass
Why, I won't touch down 'til I see Tijuana
Put cash that I couldn't spend, countless cars
An addict for a wife, my life, as a ghetto star
No remorse, no repentance as I buck one down
Born soldier, fucked 'em up with a MAC-fo'
Torn ligaments, all up in that nigga shoulder
And a vest couldn't protect that flesh
Cause I got, slugs, to knock the air out your chest
I guess they heard that I got them birds
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
My life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
Live my life as a ghetto star
When I grow up I wanna be like them
And live my life as a ghetto star
