In this motherfucking life I lead, shit
A hell of motherfucking road blocks
And crooked cops
We still ride though
What side? Westside
I want money in large amounts
My garage full of cars that bounce
Movin' my tapes in major ways, â€˜cause every dollar counts
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks
They runnin' off at the mouth 'til I fill it up with my pump
They jump, my automatic keep 'em wary
Why you frontin' like you Billy Badass? Nigga, you scary
I've been knowin' you for years
We was high school peers, in junior high
I was itchin' to kill, and you was ready to die
While you bullshittin', niggas was dyin' and catchin' cases
Bustin' my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places
Leavin' no trace, they see my face and they buried
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
I ain't a killer but don't push me, dawg
For the family I'll send that ass straight to God
When vision is blurry, the money is clear
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
*Bin Laden* on the phone and that nigga talkin' crazy
I don't know who to blame, him or *Bush* for killin' babies
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer
And it ain't safe at home, so I sleep with a Glock (no mistakes)
E.D.I. went from a Bad Boy to an anybody killer
Look out, wanted man, guns in hand, stand firm
Nuts and my pride, now let's burn
Holding my ground, now we the last ones breathin'
I stay protected
By God, my squad, and this thing in my palm
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
When you see me, nigga, holla my set!
