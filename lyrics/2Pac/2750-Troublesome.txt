Hahaha, troublesome 19-motherfuckin'-96
Makaveli
Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Makin niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land underhanded hits are planned
Undercover agents die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader
never leave the block without my heater
Shit them niggas that shot me is still terrified I'll get they ass
We Outlawz, motherfuckers can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit, but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form
Let it be known I'm troublesome
Call the punk police, they can't stop us
Niggas run the streets, we troublesome
A guerrilla in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor
bet I bomb on the first niggas
Knew we came for murder, pullin up in a hearse
Westside was the war cry
Screamin, "Fuck - ALL Y'ALL NIGGAZ" in Swahili
Pistol packin fresh out of jail, I ain't goin back
Release me to the care, of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
nine
Hearin thoughts of my enemies pleadin please
Busta-ass motherfuckers tried to flee
Picture me lettin this chump survive
Ran up on his ass, when I dumped he died;
Thug Life
Bad Boy killa
Murder murder my mind state, shit ain't changed
Since my last rhyme - the crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin shots like they lost they mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed they mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how could I cry
Tried to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Either take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
I'm troublesome like my nigga Napoleon said nigga
Makaveli the Don the boss of all bosses
Mussolini,
E.D.I. Mean,
Hussein Fatal,
Kadafi
Kastro,
Napoleon
Komani
