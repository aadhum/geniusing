Rest in peace to my motherfucker Biggy Smallz
Thug Life
God bless the dead, and buried
Nigga, don't worry if you see God first
Tell him shit got worse, I ain't mad
I know you representin the crew
And I can picture you in heaven with a blunt and a brew
Fuck the world
pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models - gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlers, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggy
Sayin shit don't stop nigga no pity
We all hoods
and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin' motherfuckers plot scandalous schemes
gutter
you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin
never meant to do time
My epitaph, will read, was the last of G's
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucker wantin to hang
Two to the dome
leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
{Fuck the police} and all the courts, same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
I keep a gun and never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
Rest in peace to all the motherfuckers that passed too early
All the young motherfuckers that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin G's, this one is for you
Yo Big, this is to you my nigga

Sendin they respect, yaknowhatImean?
I pray before I go to sleep - "Dear God"
Say my grace before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm droppin to my knees, OH WHY?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock-a-bye?
uzi weighin a ton
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin so I'm flowin goin crazy
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mag did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest
