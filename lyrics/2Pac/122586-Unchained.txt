Y’all, y’all remember me
Y’all, y’all remember me
Sold me out
Last chance, fancy pants
Oh very well *gunshot*
Gotta get ready, want a big payback
The payback!
Hey, hey
I like the way you die, boy
Only wish to breed, I explode into a million seeds
Ya’ll remember me, legendary live eternally
Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face ‘em
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie
Now even if you blind you still see my prophecy
Outlawz busting busting, we untouchable
Expect me like you expect Jesus to come back
Expect me nigga, I’m comin, hahaha
