Sometimes I do it in vain
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC
They won't be happy 'til I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
I throw peace to The Bay
Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way
But 2Pacalypse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground
