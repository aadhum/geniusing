Got any last words
Yeah I've got some last words
Ice Cube's in the muthafuckin' house
The nigga you love to hate
Here comes the nigga with the ruff, the terror
My Uzi weighs a motherfucking ton
Pigs wear blue
I wear black, nothing but black
Cause Goddamn it's a brand new payback
Fuck Pat Sajak
Stop me, clock me, cops wanna Glock me
But the punk motherfucking pigs can't stop me
Now they're after me, why?, cause a nigga's Black
Spittin' facts and ain't afraid to pull a trigger back
Let em come step to a real muthafucker
(Boom Boom) Mama ain't raised no suckers
Dan Quayle, don't you know you need to get your ass kicked?
Where was you when there was niggas in the caskets?
Muthafucker Rednecks all the same
Fear a real nigga if he ain't balled and chained
That's why we burn shit and wreck
Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dread, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga, but they can't take us all
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place (ha ha ha)
Keeping the smile off they White face
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it
And when we blast
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz
