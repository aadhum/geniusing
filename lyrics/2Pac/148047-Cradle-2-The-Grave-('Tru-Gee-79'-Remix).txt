Westside
M.O.B
First to bomb
Keeping niggas suspicious
Pictures of closed caskets
Soon as Daz get with me (I am first to bomb)
Westide, Outlawz till we die, Thug life
[Verse 3 : Eminem]
I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many mothafuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who would've thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government, I'm loving it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it
My alias is Makaveli
grapevine
