So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is
I wanna be… I, I, not "I wanna be"
I am 2Pac, 2Pac (2005!)

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeep's
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
Last time them niggas rushed me
I ain't bust, but now I'm touched;
trust me
Ain't nuttin' jumpin' but these buckshots
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge, now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Bustin' out the back seat, nigga, when we clown
Comin' round the corner spittin' rounds
They can't hold me down
I bet you that I got something you ain't got
That's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle
It ain't Scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G
‘Cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do
‘Cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
