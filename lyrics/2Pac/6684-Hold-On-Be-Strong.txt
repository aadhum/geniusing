I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin' weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin' by
And drive-by's robbed my homies of their young lives
Never did like the police
Let the whole world know, now I gets no peace
â€˜Cause they chasin' me down
These things that a thug goes through
And still I rise, so keep your head up
And make your mind strong
It's a struggle every day, but you gotta hold on
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I wonder if Heaven got a ghetto,
and if it does
Does it matter if you Blood or you Cuz?
You gotta keep your head to the sky
And be strong, most of all, hold on
You know what Billie Holiday said?
Bay-bee, God bless the child that can hold his own
When things get bad
Especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin', hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic
