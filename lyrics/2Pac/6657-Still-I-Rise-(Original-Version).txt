Ninety-six big body
Sittin' on chrome
(Fuckin' with this Alize)
Somebody wake me I'm dreamin', I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin' upstream, planted in the womb while screamin'
On the top, was my pops, my momma screamin' stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, the product of this heated passion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of ass
Look how it began, nobody gave a fuck about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin' white Jesus
Will a nigga live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
In the deep, dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin'
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks, Glocks or a herringbone
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise
When five O be comin'
Niggas be runnin'
For they life and freedom
No faces for open caskets, peelin' ya cap backwards
