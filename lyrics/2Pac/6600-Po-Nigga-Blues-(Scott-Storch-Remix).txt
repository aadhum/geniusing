Why'd you slang crack? I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Why'd you slang crack? Cause I had to
Crazy, I gotta work with what'chu gave me
You claimin I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
And got a busted jaw for sayin fuck the law
Walkin around, ready to light shit up
But since my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
I'm old enough to go to war, but I ain't old enough to drink
Make your rules, I'mma break 'em
No matter how much you make 'em, you show me bacon I'm take 'em
And the nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home
So he can go out and bone, huh
