[Verse 1: 2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit, reminisce in bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
We never really went through that
Because we was born B.C. - you and me before crack
And nowadays things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth cause the truth look strange
And for me it's reverse
We left them a world that's cursed and it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And y'all condemned like Malcolm X and Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't 'em let me get teary
The world looks dreary
But when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There is no need for you to fear me
If you take the time to hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we're human
I hope we'll see the light before it's ruined
My Ghetto Gospel
Tell me, do you see that old lady? Ain't it sad?
Livin' out of bags but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy, well guess she's givin' birth to a baby!
Lord can you hear me speak?
Can you forgive me for my sins?
I hope the Lord can understand me
A man's gotta do what he can for his family
And pay the price of being hellbound
