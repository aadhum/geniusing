Yeah, ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier
The plan, to take command of the whole family
All my road dogs, official mob figures
Love to act up, the first to bomb when we rob niggas
To be the boss, only thought's: grip on chrome 9's
Niggas get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennessy
Screamin' "Fuck the police!" as I ride through the night streets
Little child runnin' wild, towards danger
What's the cause? Don't be alarmed, death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin' nigga, unleash the Sandman
Promise a merciless retaliation, nothin' is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
If you play the game, you play to win
It's a crazy world full of sin
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switched, now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin', "Bloody murder, murder!"
Blast, tell me, homie, what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm ready to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
If you play the game, you play to win
It's a crazy world full of sin
Who wanna see me in a challenge?
So merciless, I'm terrifyin' niggas in my ballads
Do you feel me?
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin' at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggas facin' 60 years
Sheddin' tattooed tears, another suicidal on the tier
Takin' private planes, tryin' to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
If you play the game, you play to win
It's a crazy world full of sin
This go out to Kato, Mental, all the niggas that passed away
Mutulu, Geronimo, Seyku â€“ all the down-ass riders
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head,
Tryin' to see me in chains, shit
Them niggas'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell, they'll see me in Hell
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin' block; fuck the cops!
These niggas can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire
