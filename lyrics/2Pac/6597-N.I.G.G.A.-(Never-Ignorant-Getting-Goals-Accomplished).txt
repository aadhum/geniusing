{"Niggas!"} Yeah.. uh..
{"Niggas!"}
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
My two 9's go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
.. uhh, straight take his life
Lickin off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now
Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas, haha
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em Bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is headshots
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
My bars is therapy, as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
Muah 'til the day that they bury me
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
Know what the llama do
Shady/Aftermath
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do
{"Niggas!"} Nigga! Can't fuck with us
