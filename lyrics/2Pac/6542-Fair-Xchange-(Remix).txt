Picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Wanna "Freak Like Me", fuck Adina
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
Penitentiary dick,
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin' first, and that ain't no fair exchange
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceilin'
I can make you cum 61 times
Remember me? "I Get Around,"
and I'm haunted by my "Temptations"
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin' like you perfect
Instead of fakin' like you can't hear the bed shakin'
I had you mufflin' your screams in the sheets, fuckin' with me
Here's my number for another fair exchange
