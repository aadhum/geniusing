Cause uh, niggas talk plenty shit, so many tricks
I fucked your bitch cause I'm true to this, witness the hit
You talk bad about a nigga when I got blasted
Hope you made a little money while the funk lasted
Heard they call you Big Poppa nigga, how you figure?
Cause to me you'll always be a phoney fat nigga
copied
even wearing Versace,
You cross-eyed
crack baby
And I can't wait to see you niggas in traffic cause we gonna get 'em up
[Hook: 2Pac]
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac
Call the cops when you see 2Pac
Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga we hit 'em up
You Mobb Deep bitches gonna feel us when we turn into killers
Now this is me, BBK all day
