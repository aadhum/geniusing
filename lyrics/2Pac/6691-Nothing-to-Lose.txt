The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
The poverty bothers me, but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen! I can hear her crying in the bedroom
Praying for money but never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
I'm thirteen, can't feed myself
Can't turn back
Buck-buck from a Glock let the glass fly
walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too
[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali
[Ice Cube] That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
Though I'm stressing keep a vest for protection
From the barrel of a Smith & Wesson
And all my niggas in the pen, here we go again
No matter how you try, niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate, then we multiply
And if you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too
[The D.O.C] I got raw when I came to Cali
[Ice Cube] That’s why I got gang-related rhymes
If you could walk a mile in my shoes
Then you'd be crazy too
