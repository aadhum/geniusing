[Intro: 2Pac]
Outlaw Immortalz
Bow down to somethin' greater than yourself, trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know you watchin'
But you ain't seein' what lies before you, biatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
Blessed with the gift of speech
The power to reach
Each nigga on every street
May the heavenly father look down and be proud of what transpired
Since the day the seed was planted
Just me and my dogs, livin' like hogs
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true
*laughing*
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
Out for revenge on bitch niggas that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed
He shoulda never fucked around with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggas run
Best be prepared for the Outlawz, here we come
I'm robbin' ya niggas' cradle with a knife in your navel
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin' Desert Eagle
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
I be shinin' like white diamonds and crystal
Glistenin' holdin' pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
And assholes who claim, like they be runnin' thangs
I be gunnin' those same niggas runnin' late, to their fate
My alias is motherfuckin' Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
They call me Idi
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby
Haha, like them niggas said
"What would you do? If you could fuck with me and my crew"
Thug Life right? This year we Thug Life
But we Outlaw Immortalz
We die nigga, but we multiply, we like legends nigga
Like I'll make you famous motherfucker
I'm talkin about Newsweek and Time Magazine and all that ol good shit
My niggas make the papers baby
My niggas make the front page
