We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me, G
Everybody smoked with they locs and they yokes on
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
"If you ever need a place to stay"
“Well, alright, y'all”
“Brothers and sisters”
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang 'caine on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' 'caine
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rapping tracks to make stacks
But now I don't wanna down my homie
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
Well, it's ninety-one and I'm living kinda swell now
But I guess that the streets is harder
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred and blurred and changed in shape
I gotta take my place or fall from grace
