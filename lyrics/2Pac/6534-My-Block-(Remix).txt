Damn, take a ride to my block
My block, that's right! Hehe
'Round my motherfuckin' way
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest, forever weary; my eyes stay teary
For all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black-on-black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm getting worried
Teardrops and closed caskets,
the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested but open fire?
Life in the pen ain't for me, ‘cause I'd rather die
I wonder if the Lord still cares for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive? The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin' on a four-five
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
Forever hop, ‘cause it don't stop – on my block
Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
Fearing jail, but crack sales got me living well
Staying strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God, help me, ‘cause I'm starving, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
In my heart I felt alone, out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home – on my block
Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
Swollen pride and homicide don't coincide
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block, exterminating black life
But I can't blame the dealers;
my mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Fantasies of a nigga living phat but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
I hit the green just to maintain, feeling pain
For all the niggas that I lost to the game – from my block
Living life is but a dream
Hard times is all we seen (on my block)
