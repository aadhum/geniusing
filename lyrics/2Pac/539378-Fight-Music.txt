You know what? When you said that last time
I was kind a trippin right, but now
You're right, I am crazy
But you know what else? I dont give a fuck
Check it out
Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
Cryin, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell,
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
What side you tryin' be on, the barrel or the trigger
The only reason I got foes that used to be friends
When niggas mumble under their breathe, I'm under their skin
