This go out to C. Delores Tucker,
Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everybody, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop haters
Here goin' against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too loud it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban 2Pac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
Get rich or die tryin' nigga ask 50
I've been Operatin' Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government
Washed around by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screamin' Hip-Hop deceased?
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Delores Tucker sue me I won't stop
'Til we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spittin' it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
If God strike me with lightnin', I'm shootin' him back
I'm buckin' at Corey Brooke he treatin' my niggas wrong
[Verse 4: Yaki Kadafi]
pop too long gone
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep goin' (Keep goin')
