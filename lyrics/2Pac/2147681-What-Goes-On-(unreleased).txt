[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
Poppin' mo' game than a Sega
Rollin' Cherokee and not a Blazer
Fuck the 5-0, watch for lasers
Tell me: what goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty
Uh, I'm doin' flicks
fuck the Grammys
[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
Victim of an old school OC from the corner
[Chorus: sample]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
Shoot a cop for every blow, wish Rodney had a fo-fo
Smokin' cops like indo
So, then, maybe their friends know
Straight outta Oakland
[Chorus + Outro: sample and back-voicing]
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
So what really goes on
Dope fiends titty (tell me)
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than a dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
That's colder than dope fiend's titty, tell me
What goes on in the city?
Colder than a dope fiend's titty
Can you tell me?
