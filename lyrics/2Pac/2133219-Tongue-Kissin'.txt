It's like you scared, I might care
I'll never hurt you or desert you, I'll be right there
Let's come together, if you trust me then I can show you
Don't be shamed, it's the changes that people go through
Don't be scared of me, come close to me please
I can see upset your mine give you what you need
Can I proceed? who do you believe in?
Afraid to leave, but too scared that you need him
Set it free, I can take you to new places
Gettin' hotter now, calm down, get a grip
Slow, baby, ain't no need for rushin' this
I touch your lips and give you kisses that you won't forget
As I whisper in your ear, disappear to a different zone
Promise not to move to fast, I got time
Rather have some conversation, drop lines
Can ya hear me? Tell me if you move, in my groove
Would you do what I ask you to?
Any a brother in his right mind love to spend some time at home
Though your hurtin' I can feel your pain
Try to understand, we ain't all the same
Let me take you away, can you leave
Some place, to find true peace?
Let me be your lover, a positive figure
Heart beatin' at a fast rate
Makin' moves in the nude
Pictures of me, inside you, want it so bad I could die
I've been possessed, so obsessed to undress you
