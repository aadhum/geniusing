Quit starin' at me like an infrared nigga
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't fall to sleep
You can get ya cash on
sippin' my glass full of Henny
Soon as I open fire, niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap, a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks, makin' scratch the wrong way
I inhale strong weed, then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war
I'm starin' through my rear view, doin' 'bout 90
The pedal to the metal, so I can't see what's behind me
o's
I got that thug life shit runnin' through my veins
They say that the mo' they hate ya the mo' that it motivate ya
Red dotted
Ruger
