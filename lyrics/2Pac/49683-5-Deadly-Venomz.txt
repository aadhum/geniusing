Now they after me, prowling for a niggas bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
True to what I'm writing
and I'm striking like a viper
[Verse 2: Treach]
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
To the Onyx of your nose
I shout, "I'm de MC wit de nasty mouf!" and kick the bitch out
Sue me? I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
My sign is stop!
[Verse 3: Stretch of Live Squad]
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
MAC-11 blaster, and I run faster
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)
quick on the flip tip
The psycho,
and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
A nigga hit 'em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
yo 'Pac.)
[Verse 5: 2Pac]
keep a nine in my waistline
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played,
a mouth full of fronts
(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here
[Verse 6: Apache]
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
You can't get in because my gate's bigger
cinch in a clinch, your punch is like a pinch
Test the rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Choke 'em with my boot lace,
in effect for ninety-three
