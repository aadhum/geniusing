[Intro]
One part Aliz√©, one part Cristal
Thug passion, baby
This drink is guaranteed to get the pussy wet and the dick hard
I ain't tryin' to turn you all niggas into alcohols - alcoholics
So come and get some of this thug passion, baby
But they ain't feelin' me, a motherfuckin' fool, about
My fuckin' cheddar cheese
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Thug passion got you tremblin' like Death on the Row
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
Observin' you motherfuckers, 'cause some of you bitches funny
Say you want it but you bullshittin'
Lickin' them lips, you got me about to act a fool quick
Full blown and furious
Baby, get a grip, when I be doin' this
It's so physical my attraction
Driven by alcohol, beware of my reaction
Baby I'm born to ball
Thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it, it's a portion for my niggas in motion
Forever blastin', bitches ain't ready for this thug passion
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
I heard it's the bomb
And you got it goin' on
Give me some of your thug passion, baby
You got me drippin' wet
From the way you make me sweat
