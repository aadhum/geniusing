West Side
Huh
Smooth criminal,
seein' hell, made me rougher
Bang, with the Outlaw clique
Pull it, my every word like a bullet
Hollow point style
Well it's the O.U.T.L.A.W's
And we untouchable
Bringin' the ruckus
The crime on these streets
and blunts to blaze
Hustlin' to get paid,
Fuckin' wit' outlawz, it's crazy
Best to duck quick, and run for safety
