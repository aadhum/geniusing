It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city,
the cops is on top of me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings
Leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the
cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath
More bodies bein' buried, I'm losin' my homies in a hurry
They're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live?
No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is;
what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
Outlaw
Everyday there's mo' death
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin'
When I gets to pervin'
riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess
Steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress
To make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out,
keep your head up,
and handle it!
