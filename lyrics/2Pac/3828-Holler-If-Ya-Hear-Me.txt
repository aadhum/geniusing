Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday, G
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
Now we got a nigga smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when they free ya if not when they shove me in
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'mma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
[Sample]
"Hard"
"Tellin' you to hear it"
"The rebel"
Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me
PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -
They claim that I'm violent
but still I keep
Representin, never give up on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
