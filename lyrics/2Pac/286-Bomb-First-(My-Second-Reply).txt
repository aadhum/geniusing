In today's music news: The ever-controversial 2Pac Shakur
Has just released another album under the alias "Makaveli"
Resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
Of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well
Nas, the alleged ring leader, is furious at 2Pac
Excuse me – Makaveli's verbal assault on
Mobb Sleep
Notorious P.I.G.
Jay Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame,
Big Little whatever
And several other corny sounding motherfuckers
Are understandably shaken up by this release
Was not available for comment, but released this statement:
It's not about East or West
It's about niggas and bitches, power and money
Riders and punks – which side are you on?
*gunshots*, *followed by several encroaching footsteps*
These niggas is still fucking talking?
You niggas still breathing? Fucking roaches, aight
Raid for you cockroaches
Allow me to introduce first: Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like The Holy Qur'an
Niggas get shook like 5-0
My .45 is next to me when we ride, for survival
swollen pockets
Expose snakes ‘cause they breed freely
See me ride! Located worldwide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dope fiend's titty
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggas down to die for me
Know what I mean?
I hit the scene
Niggas ducking from my guillotine stare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
Extreme venom,
Cut ’em down, to hell is where we send ’em
My whole team; trained to explode,
ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically and I'm not gonna cry
Me; a born leader, never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them "my bitch-nigga eaters"
And not a whimper until I'm gone
Thug Life running through my veins, so I'm strong
Bye bye bye
Oh, how do we do these niggas, but I'm not gonna cry
I'm a Bad Boy killer,
Jay-Z die too
Looking out for Mobb Deep,
nigga, when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggas down to die for me? Yay-yay
West Coast rider, coming right behind ya
Should have never fucked with me
I won't rest until my road dog's free; bomb first
Please, reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
Please reconsider before you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or your life, and I'ma bomb first
E.D.I. Mean
For so many days, in so many ways
We've been ducking strays they delivers
But still we some Bad Boy killers
Got nothing to lose, I gots nowhere to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do what you'll never do
And that's ride for the cause, yes, I'll die for the cause
You best believe, if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo, I'm dying with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a motherfucking Nazi
Got a little question for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game
For the motherfucking cash, mane
Then what is your motherfucking purpose?
Non can serve us
E.D.I. Mean,
born worthless
That's until the day I decided to bomb first, bitch
Your style wack as ever, like you was rocking patent leather
Causing massive terror
y'all niggas lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper, half drug kingpin
You're telling fairy tales,
dunn
"King of New York" like you the motherfucking one?
Jers'
From the Clare down to North Bricks, all my niggas flippin’ chips, gettin’ rich, even though it's hard
Without scarred by a revolve
With no warning signs, ‘cause yo, my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the 9 ready to put in my time
Shoot first, look at their head, burst bleeding
Don't want to hear no shit this evening, believe me
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
Plan, plot, strategize, and bomb first
(Start of "Hail Mary")
Let us pray, my niggas
For we have definitely sinned
