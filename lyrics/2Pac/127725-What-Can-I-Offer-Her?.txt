All of my life I dreamed of meeting one
with immense beauty, and once I found her
I would charm her and she'd be mine
forever.
I have found her and indeed she is all
I wished for and more but she is
not charmed nor intrigued.
Then I
think 2 myself "What can I offer her?"
The tears warm my eyes and blur my
vision.
