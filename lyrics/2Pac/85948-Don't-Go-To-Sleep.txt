semiâ€”automatic
Soon as I open fire niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap, it's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
makin' scratch the wrong way
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the East to West
