Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin' hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin' up to God quicker
hair trigger
Semi-automatic MAC-11 just to scare niggas
Pardon my thug poetry
but suckers is born everyday
And feared men grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries,
a legend in my own rhymes
So niggas whisper when they mention
Machiavelli
Donald Goines
Mama sent me to go play with the drug dealers
we thug niggas and we came in packs
Every one of niggas strapped sippin' on â€˜yak
these streets got me cravin' thorazine
Fat as that ass that honey shakin'
I bust a trey-trey,
Y'all don't want no funk cause
Y'all be the next in the long line of war stories
and dumping the hot ones up in your brain
More bigger balls than RuPaul
[Verse 5: Napoleon]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nothing on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
when niggas ran up
In my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then? No one would tell me since I was three
Heard that God took my peoples, now they living somewhere free
And now I'm sitting, holding in anger because my parents missing
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Thug Life

Motherfucking 2Pac a.k.a. Makaveli
