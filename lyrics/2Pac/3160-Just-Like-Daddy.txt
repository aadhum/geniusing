Death Row, Makaveli Records
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy
Her moms let her do what she please, an' seen no one loved her
baby got plans to mold ya
In the coldest nights is when I hold ya
Like I'm supposed to, as we roll closer
I'll take yo' hand gladly, anything you need, ask me
Supportin' my baby girl just like daddy
To alleviate the stress, spendin' time wit' you, I feel blessed
When you gone, feel the pain so strong deep in my chest
When I got arrested, came so close to goin' to jail
Throwin' blows at the po-pos breakin' ya nails
While my fake homies try to fuck you, you run and tell me
That's why I stay committed
I thank God every time I hit it
Hopin' you'll forgive me for all the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world, we untouchable
Ya never had a father or a family, but I'll be there
I know ya gave me your heart, plus
When I'm dirt broke and fucked up, ya still love me
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy
Boo, would ya die for me?
Down holdin' my pistol, gettin' high
Puttin' hickeys on ya belly while we fuckin' on the beach
Lookin' out for ya just like daddy
Jjust
