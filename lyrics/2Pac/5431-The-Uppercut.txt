[Intro: 2Pac Talking]
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends and the felons
We all lost souls tryna find our way to heaven
