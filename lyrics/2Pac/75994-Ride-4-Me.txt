Look, I need more than just romantic feelings
When shit is frantic need a bitch
Mind for numbers same to wonder with this drug dealin'
Thug feelings make me a villain to the PH imbalance of civilians
To be involved with the killin' must be a immune to squealin'
This is how I plan a night
First we ride on the bustas then we dine
Eatin' dinner by candlelight
Be alert and put in works with a thugz passion
I'm a king, and you the queen up in thugz mansion
Me, I'm a never be a busta, I ride for keeps
I know you shy but please reply, would you ride for me?
