Why? Do you want to fuck me?
Lookin' kinda good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Yo, let's stop fakin', be real now
I got a room and a hard-on; still down?
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
What's ya phone number?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready
Baby, let me give you a call
How long will it take to break you off?
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece, more than just fine
Money over bitches, let me hear you say
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone!
let the Outlawz play
[Girl and 2Pac converse]
Then I put it in my mouth. I sucked it
that Thug Passion
[2Pac] Heh, heh. Eh, so what you doing right now, though?
[Girl] Me and my finger are getting acquainted
Do a bear shit in the woods and wipe his ass with a rabbit?
You gonna feel that Thug Passion for real
[2Pac] I'm on my way though. I'm about to fly over there in a 500. It ain't gonna take but a minute. Eh, light the candles, get the baby oil out, turn all the lights out.
Drink a little bit of that shit.
I'm gon knock the taste out your mouth, girl
I can't find the steering shift,
