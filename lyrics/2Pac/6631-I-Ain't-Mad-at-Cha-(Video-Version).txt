[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Father forgive us for livin while all my homies stuck in prison
Barely breatin believin that the world is a prison
It's like a ghetto we can never leave
A broken rose givin bloom to the cracks of the concrete
So many other things for us to see
Things to be, our history so full of tragedy and misery
To all my homies never made it home
The dead peers I shed tattooed tears for, when I'm alone
Picture us inside a ghetto heaven,
In my chest I feel pain comin sudden storms
Life full of rain in this game watch for lead thorns
I beg God, to make a way for our ghetto kids to breathe
Show a sign, make us all believe
