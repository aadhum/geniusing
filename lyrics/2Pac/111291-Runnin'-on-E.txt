If you a bad boy then you die
If you a bad boy then you die
Now ever since momma got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us, murderous thugs showin' less love in the drug house
Similar to savages, it's a wonder we manage
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin' the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin' street
Like the sound of police
Who run the streets really?
In every hood legends grow
From the hustlaz up at Harlem to shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress, we strapped
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath, a lesson I possess like jewels
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
