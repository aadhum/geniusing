What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggas be the craziest
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin' drunk to keep from goin' under
Unloadin' my clip, I'm watchin' every bullet spit when I kick 'em
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggas that's caught
Had a motherfuckin' warrant but he didn't go to court
real motherfuckin' G
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
So much pain in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
Got a nigga losin' hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Huh, Big Syke he be ready for whatever
My nigga Kato, ready for whatever
