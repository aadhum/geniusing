Started off with, runnin from copses duck and hide from helicopters
Gettin twenty-five to life, if the judge don't like us
See if a, nigga don't hustle then the nigga don't eat
Heroin bein consumed already predicitin my doom, soon
To be one of the many misguided
Always the first one on the block to be done tried it and liked it
Lost before I had a chance to find my way
Now I travel through life, not knowin the time of day
