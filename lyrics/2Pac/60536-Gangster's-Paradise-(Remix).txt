Dear mama
Don't wanna commit murder
But damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin
And talkin behind my back
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune
Here's my chance to spin it
I listen to him scream
Tray Deee went insane
Dear mama
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped
You're better off gettin shot up
Dear mama
It's hard to adapt
When you're black
And you're trapped
In a livin Hell
