Let this be my motherfuckin' reply to that little bitch [?]
(Yo 'Pac do that shit Westside style)
You heard it wrong nigga
Ain’t nothing sweet about my techniques
My history so thoroughly involves destruction
Niggas left with their ass bleeding, lyrical fucking (wooahh)
When I check for the Heartz of Men what do we find?
Niggas watching for my pockets, planning plots on mine
Am I blind
Let my rhymes speak for me in history
Fuck what you say we untouchable
Now that we done shook Doc Dre
He ain’t made a beat in six years, swear he the shit
Won’t get no record sales sucking Nas' dick
The wrong one for you to speak on
Motherfucker watch your mouth
Look I heard Nas got beef cause I’m dissing his clique
Cool(skinny nigga) come bring your ass nigga you can get dissed
I'm worldwide steady war rapping
Get your cash on nigga, five times platinum (how many you sold?)
What’s that
De-La got a problem with this hard shit
Ever since "Me myself and I" y'all been garbage
(you know I'm tellin the truth)
Y’all went three feet and stopped rising (I ain't seen shit)
Wendy Williams is a fat bitch, that’s the truth
I got a jar full of niggas nuts(slurp, slurp), that’s for you
Let the Westside-Eastside drama cease
I’ll come alone to your own streets, Outlaw
Prepare for panic when I unleash
What I bring to you is hardcore
The very essence of my poetry
Dyslexic so you backward ass niggas will know it's me
Don’t get your life took trying to run with your homies
On this worldwide mash trying to get some cash
Holla, my name and the game will follow
Wait and I’ll murder these snakes tomorrow
They say 'Pac ain’t got love for the Eastside
My dream is to see real niggas and real bitches
Get to together and have real kids and have a real
Life and get real money
Come on, uh
Ya this might have been your muthafuckin record label
When you was here, nigga
When you see where you at, and you see where the fuck I’m at, nigga
Westside. Deathrow the Untouchable style, nigga
I took your shit, you bitch made nigga
You up out of this shit, nigga
You got it erased nigga
You know the muthafuckin history
M.O.B. nigga, mob style
We don’t like your trick ass
You up out of here, nigga
By murder, or by hardcore styles
It took hardcore styles for your ass to walk
You walkin nigga
You don’t even come out in the morning
Cuz you know what time it is
Don’t even front muthafucka
You think by getting with my enemy
That will get you some love with my heart, nigga?
FUCK YOU
