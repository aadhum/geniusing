[Stretch:]
One time, one time, nigga, one time! (Where?)
Runnin' from the police (Yeah, I know what you mean)
No matter what I do, they got a nigga
Still runnin' from the police
Put them motherfucking Nike's on tight and get ghost y'all
I ain't got nuttin' on my mind, but gettin' in some trouble
Licking shots to they block, leavin' bloody blood puddles
For some ridah's delight
now we in a gunfight
I can shoot the gauge pebbles at the devils or die tonight
It's on me
if I die, bury me a motherfucking G
A open casket on them bastards so they all remember me
With my vest on my chest, my tools and my piece
Thug Life motherfucker, got me runnin' from the police
K-Dog
chillin' with a crew
Every damn day parlay with my glass of Re
The O.J. and it's all okay
To that fuckin' fake cop, got to play the man
Damn, I hope it don't spill
cock back my steel
Still runnin' from the police
I got you peepin' in my window, while I'm smokin' indo
But I ain't no motherfucking track star, pigs got a jeep
Big Malcolm
runnin' through motherfucker's backyards
So I grabs my piece before I flee
And instead of me runnin', these bitches is runnin' from me
Buju Banton
Me have to blast back, cause they blast at me
with my nigga Biggie Smalls
I grew up, a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin' to turn into the black Frank White
And we got the workers choppin' rock
Biggie pass the steel
Let's serve these motherfuckers, slugs as a fuckin' meal
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
A fist full of bullets
a chest full of Teflon
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
They got me runnin' from the
five-o
Duckin' and dodgin' and my survival
Cause in my mind all I wonder is who's next
Nigga, my homie slipped and now he pays the price
He did a drive-by, sixteen, now he's doin' triple life
Tell me is it me or my upbringin'
I spit that thug shit
Nigga, motherfuck singin'
I hope you got your Timberlands on tight
Cause I ain't givin' up
I'm runnin' through the projects, biatch
They'll never catch me
Cause I'm loc'ed and trigger happy on the, sniatch
Don't say you never heard of me, til they murder me
I'm a legend
Do thug niggas go to heaven?
Thoro Headz
We gettin' ghost on them hoes and yo
I got no love for the five-o
