Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I could make miracles with pimp hoes
It's instrumental, waiting for the nymphos, that's the intro
Shoot when you rush me
Walked up and touched me
Why do you want to fuck me?
Just cause I'm paid in the worst way? True!
Looking kind of good in your birthday suit
I wonder if you're wild and you act shy?
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips
Goddamn, I love that shit!
Yo, let's stop faking and be real now
I got a room and a hard-on. Still down?
Met you standing at a bar full of black dudes
Said you wanna see my scars and my tattoos
When we head for my hideout, act right
Boss player when I ride out, that's right
What's ya phone number?
