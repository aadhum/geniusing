G: Why'd you slang crack
P: I had to
G: Why'd you pack the straps
P: Cause I had to)
G: Why'd you jack the scratch
P: Cause I had to
G: Say what, say what
P: A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent
You certified crazy
I got to work with what you gave me
Claiming' I'm a criminal and you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
Now I'm lost in this Holocaust headed for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war
And got a busted jaw for sayin' fuck the law
And if you wonder why I'm mad check the record
Sometimes I think I'm gettin' tested
And if I don't say yes a nigga's quick to get arrested
I keep a vest on my chest in case the cops are gettin' restless
They make a nigga be a killer I used to be a dealer
But they wanted to see who's realer
Now them same mothafuckas wanna murder me
And I wonder If the Lord ever heard of me (uh)
I need loot so I'm doin' what I do
And don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes
There was no other destiny to choose
I had nothin' left to lose so I'm singin' nigga blues
Why did you slang crack (Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps (Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch (Cause I had to)
A nigga got to pay the fuckin' rent
Poppa need brand new shoes
But what the fuck can a nigga do
My little boy got to eat too
So why must I sock-a-fella
Just to live large like Rockefeller?
And did you ever stop to think
I'm old enough to go to war
But I ain't old enough to drink
Cops want to hit me with the book
And you're hooked on my eye don't give a fuck look
To my brothers In the barrio
You livin' worse than the niggas In the ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion
You got love from the niggas in my section
Down with my homeboy Rich
Cause you punks havin' babies can't raise the niggas (What's up kid)
And they bound to be fuckups too
Drinkin' forties of brew singin' nigga blues
[Hook: 2Pac & Govenor]
Why did you slang crack (Cause I had to)
Why did you pack straps (Cause I had to)
Why did you jack the scratch (Cause I had to)
Come on, Come on Now I'm headin' for the mothafuckin' penn
