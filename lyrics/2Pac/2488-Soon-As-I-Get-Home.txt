Dear baby, it's me again, stuck inside this max pen
Tryna pay my debt for all my sins
See, these penitentiary times be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm living just to die
I'm living in hell, stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail, waiting for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks and mash in fast Jags
Busters are shady, so I'm dumping on cowards
Crazy when ever faded
I know I said it all before, but now I mean it
Visions of me and you ballin', so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me
You'll be glad to see the strategy
Of making these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning, baby, life is good
Me and you against the whole hood, soon as I get home
Grab my straps, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Soon as I get home
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I come home
Sittin' here looking at pictures of me and you livin'
But now you out in the world, while I'm twistin' in prison
Plus I never had to worry 'bout a visit
â€˜Cause you're there daily
C-O
I started a war, but now I'm gone
Grab my gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Let's get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home
Since you've been gone
My whole life's been like a game of Cee-low
Fulfillin' my dreams, like Nino
Brown
And me and Mama surviving
Depends on how many rocks a nigga cook up
seen those niggas you blasted
Wanting me in a casket
Yeah, nigga, I heard, Lil' Mu gave the word
double O's is what I'm wantin'
And I'm tryna see somethin' that we ain't never had
Luxury life, results living bad
Tricks of the trade,
shit that should've been taught by Dad
But learned through the crew
Grab the gats, locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets into a war zone
Soon as I get home
