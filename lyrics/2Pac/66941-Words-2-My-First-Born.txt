My homies murdered execution style runnin' in the drug house
What was supposed to be a easy hit
Now shit is flipped,
only the questions of who smoked the man
Young adolescents in our prime live a life of crime
Though it ain't logical, we hobble through these tryin' times
to the thugs in Heaven, I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
'Cause wild seeds can't grow,
