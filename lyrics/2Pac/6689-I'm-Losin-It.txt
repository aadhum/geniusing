Straight out the motherfuckin' Bay
Here we go
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep prayin'
For a young motherfucker tryin' to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waitin' to jack
He don't know I got a Glock 'til his ass get shot
Cravin' beats like they motherfuckin' drugs to me,
What's up with bitches tryin' to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
I'm livin' like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
