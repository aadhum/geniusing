Plus all day, I puff weed till my eyes bleed red
I bust at Bad Boy
Mobb Deep
and murder The Firm
When you scream "Fake thugs," who the fuck you mean?
Get more cream than all of y'all, nigga, fuck your team
Now Dre want to switch sides
Last year, I'd shed tears, but I don't cry no more
Plus Jay-Z tried to play me
Go ask King Sun how it feel to have your ass gone
Listen Doo-Wop, don't get your shit knocked, you can't win
Got shot 5 times
[2Pac]
seeing scenes of me ballin'
