Just a ghetto star, a dropped up double-R is what I'm riding
So now I got the law on me, my phone's tapped
So I had to send word through my little homies
We still cool but you played yourself
Give him the mac and make him spray hisself, hey
a negative figure
I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematics skills from real drug dealers
I die in these streets, blast 'til they recognize
My niggas ball made a call for some backup
For little' homies and my dogs in the black truck
Buck buck was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby bring the black hearse
