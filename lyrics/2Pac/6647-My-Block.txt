They got a nigga shedding tears, reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death
My heartless breath
My life is stressed, and no rest
forever weary
My eyes stay teary for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit's scary, our black on black crime legendary
But at times unnecessary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets
the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggas on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all the little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggas give me props
[Richie Rich & 2-Pac mini skit]
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male living in hell when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
In a sense I'm suicidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped, forever trapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robbings, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home
And I can't help but wonder why
So many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's in a drive-by
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone, them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
I know the young niggas understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
