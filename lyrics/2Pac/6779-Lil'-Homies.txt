Fuckin' lil' homies…
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Lil' homies…
Everybody duckin', my fuckin' lil' homies
Straight thuggin', lil' bad young motherfuckers
Gotta love 'em
you could catch him in his G ride, clutchin' his Glock
Got my diploma, but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder, fool!
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
I remember, when you was just a lil' G, flirtin' with death
Playin' "Russian Roulette", screamin', "Kill me!"
Hey there, young nigga, what you smokin' on?
bringin' havoc
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight (my lil' homie)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets (my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
"16 On Death Row"
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace
Shell-shocked souls makin' money off of crack sales
Bust like he didn't know me; my lil' homies
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin' from these punk police
‘Cause lil' niggas run the streets
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggas gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
Lil' homies on the mash..
