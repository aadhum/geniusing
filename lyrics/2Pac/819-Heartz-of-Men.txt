[Intro]
Hey Suge, what I tell you, nigga
When I come out of jail, what was I gonna do?
I was gonna start diggin' into these niggas' chest, right
Watch this
Hey Quik
let me get them binoculars, nigga, the binoculars
Hahahaha, yeah nigga, time to ride
Grab your bulletproof vest nigga
Cause it's gonna be a long one
Now me and Quik finna show you niggas what it's like on this side - the real side
Now, on this ride there's gonna be some real motherfuckers
And there's gonna be some pussies
Now the real niggas gonna be the ones with money and bitches
The pussies are gonna be the niggas on the floor bleedin'
Now everybody keep your eyes on the prize cause the ride get tricky
See, you got some niggas on your side that say they're your friends, but in real life they your enemies
9-1-1! It's an emergency, cowards tried to murder me
From hood to the 'burbs, everyone of you niggas heard of me
I proceed to make them shiver
When I deliver
Criminal lyrics
From a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Makaveli
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
Like a southpaw you get left
Eternally I live in sin
[Chorus]
My guns bust and, if you ain't one of us, it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
In fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
And 5-0, get your lights on, the fight's on
Tonight's gonna be a fucking fight
So we might roll
Thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well, nigga's out now
[Chorus]
No longer living in fear, my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year, like I'm the chosen man
I died and came back
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Scar'd up, but still flowing
Energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate
That makes a sick motherfucker break
On these jealous ass coward cause they evil and fake
What will it take?
Give me that bass line, I'm feeling bomb
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Cause I've been sent
