How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
As I bail through the empty halls
Breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring—quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he's gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone,
but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed
'Cause life goes on

Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Yeah nigga,
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two
While schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried
Rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace!
Thug 'til I die!

Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen
So I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Nobody cries when we die,
we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own—how long we mourn?
Last year
we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all niggas make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man,
