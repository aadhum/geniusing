Who you are
One nation under a thug and bullet scar
Young nation, no revolution and no cause
One nation, young black and dangerous by far
Young nation just tryin' to get this
Murderous mind state, can't keep my 9 straight
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waitin' for the time to break
Show up and motherfuckers bow down, recognize
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw ridaz
Untouchable mob of pistol packers
Well-known felons, labelled for drug-sellin' merciless jackers
Makaveli
My Mini-14 murderin' niggas while they creepin'
Uh, duck or you ass out, drink 'til you pass out
Ain't scared to die,
drunk drivin' in my glasshouse
Niggas is under me, they bitches come to me
They heard the stories, nigga, now they wanna really see
"Bomb first" my motto,
it's fully guaranteed

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get
Out the window on some Uptown Anthem shit
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure here, I been there before
Fugitive, task force at my girlfriend door
Now they checkin' out my bedroom, I ain't there
.40 cal's, extended clips, still I ain't scared
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive
New Jersey giant, like Dave Tyree
soldier like Geronimo Pratt
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night
Through the Henny I see the eyes of the Devil

I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box
You end up in a box, ‘cause them graverobbin' bastards
Dig your grave back up, snatched you out the casket
Worms in my eyes, eatin' through my cabbage
That's why I keep pressure on them, like a open wound
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out at some other niggas, you better shoot it
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin'—I'm clever, stupid!
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless
The Nacirema dream get ready for execution
