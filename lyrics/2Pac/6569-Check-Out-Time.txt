12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here
("Hell yeah.")
("Where K and them niggas at man?")
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggas drivin' or y'all flyin' back, whassup?
("Man, I'm rollin' man, fuck that shit.")
Now I'm up early in the mornin', breath stinkin' as I'm yawnin'
Just another sunny day in California
while I'm into sexy capers
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
I never got to check out the scene
Too busy tryin' to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantasies came true with Janet on, I'm in a escapade
But did it all, end too soon
All the homies runnin' through the halls room to room
So I assume, since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause bustin' bitches is a hobby, nigga
Aiyyo man 'Pac, ay, where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin'?
Hey, I'm livin' the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin' but I'm checkin' out later
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
