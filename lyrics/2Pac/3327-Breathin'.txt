Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Tell me, nigga, tell me
Who'll be the last motherfucker breathin'?
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Had me creepin' 'round corners, homie, sleepin' in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block; call the cops
A thug nigga screamin', "Westside!", bustin' double Glocks
Bless me, Father, I'm a sinner, I'm livin' in hell
With a bunch of niggas that don't give a fuck
Ridin' as my soldiers
Bad Boy killer
Complete my mission, my competition no longer beefin'
I murdered all them bustas
Now I'm the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
I'll bust back for Pac
Ask Yak, he'll tell you that it's hell down here
Stale down here, too many jails down here
Young Noble
Fuck friends!
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
The side of the city that the Devil run from
In the belly of the beast
That's where the fuck we come from
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
Hold the wheel
I'm 'bout to give these niggas something they can feel
We hit 'em up
(Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin'?
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
Stressed, but busta free
Enemies give me reason
To be the last motherfucker breathin'
