Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Black Cotton
count my blessin's
Never got paid but still we slave
(In the nine tre')
Love's gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
[Hook: Eminem]
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky, and I ask God why)
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To us baby kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
Black cotton
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, it's curtains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a struggler
If the lord loving us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Running up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
40 acres and a blunt
Black Cotton
I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
