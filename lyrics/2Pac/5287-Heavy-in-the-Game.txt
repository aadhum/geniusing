Now how can I explain how this game laced me, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me
my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin' to make a livin'
mail
They spendin' they riches on skanless bitches, who'll stay petrified in jail
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin' no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin' through my pager, niggas know me
Don't have no homies since they jealous
I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas
listen
Ain't nothin' poppin' 'bout no broke nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game
(Game's been good to me)
(Game's been good to me)
(I don't care what it did to them
The game's been good to me)
[Verse 2: Richie Rich]
Waitin' upon your turn, son when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggas be twistin' and takin' shit
sack down
yes I'm an Oakland baller
Be your own nigga meanin' buy your own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, something I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin' and robbin', despisin' your homie
Went from a, young nigga livin' residential
To a, young nigga workin' presidential
(Game's been good to me)
(Game's been good to me)
(I don't care what it did to them)
(the game's been good to me)
young black male
cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin' dirt
My decisions do or die, been hustlin' since junior high
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five shells
Cause life is hell, and everybody dies
What about these niggas I despise
Them loud talkin', cowards shootin' guns into crowds, jeopardizin' lives
Shoot 'em right between them niggas' eyes, it's time to realize
Follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin' to make the news
Niggas confused
quit tryin' to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself
Go with the grain then, come into riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game
(Game's been good to me)
(Game's been good to me)
(I don't care what it did to them)
( the game's been good to me)
