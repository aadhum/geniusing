I'm preoccupied with having any of my statements misjudged as "hustling"!
Right now I'm writing 3 screenplays so upon my release I can recoup from my losses
Let me just tell you ever since I've read your book it has been going from person to person like a bible.
My health is fine I truly feel blessed that other than mentally I have no scars or lasting problems from my "ordeal".
Then to hear I was found guilty of something I had not done plus wondering if my family was safe SCARED ME!
