After the fire comes the rain, after the pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be ballin' again
Time to make y'all my military, be prepared for the busters
Visions of over-packed prisons, millions of niggas thug livin'
Pressure's three strikes, I hope they don't test us
So, pull the heat out, ammunition in crates
Shh! Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place
I'm sensin' niggas is defenseless
I'm hittin' fence's, then gettin' ghost
Talk a lot with your mouth, well, what you gon' do?
Slug in a nigga mug, reppin' Midwest Side
Only wish to breed,
I explode into a million seeds
Y'all remember me,
legendary, live eternally
Bury me in pieces, 'cause they fear reincarnation
Niggas screamin' peace
'Cause they fear when my squad face 'em
Blast me, but never ask me to live a lie
niggas gossip like girls, then hide
No offense to Nas, but this whole fuckin' world is mine
Even if you blind, you can still see my prophecy
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me
