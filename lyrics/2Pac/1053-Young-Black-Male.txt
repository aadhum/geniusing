Hard like an erection
Young black male
Hard like an erection
Ain't shit to fool with
Hard like an erection
Young black male
Hard like an erection
Ain't shit to fool with
Hard like an erection
Young black male
Hard like an erection
Ain't shit to fool with
Hard like an erection
Young black male
Hard like an erection
Ain't shit to fool with
[Verse: 2Pac]
I try to effect by kicking the facts
And stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat 'cause guys wanna jack
'Cause I ain't a crook, despite how I look
I don't sell yayo
They judging a brother like covers on books
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddaya know, it's off with some clothes
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males
It smells like skunk, skunk smells like that nigga, momma
Fuck you, nigga!
You ain't giving me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ides
it's an Old E thing, baby
Strictly some of that Hennessy
