Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the, suckaz with precision my intention's to get richer
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free 2Pac, it seems to be on my mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin' to take mine
So I'm a get smart, and get defensive with this
And put together a million march, for some gangsta twist, twist, twist
Two multimillionaire young brothers catchin' cases (naw)
Bustaz
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Suckaz be actin' like they savage, I'm out to get the cabbage
I got, nothin' but love, for my homies livin' lavish
Jealousy is envious, suffering is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards bust at me
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Fiends for currency and dough related
