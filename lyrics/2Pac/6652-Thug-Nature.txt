No need to cry now, go wipe your tears
Be a woman, why you actin' surprised?
You showed the bullshit; commin' fake hair
Fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you bound to fuck wit fake guys too
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin' freaky with the thug niggas up in the club
Missed me with that "buy me this, buy me that"- syndrome shit
[Hook]
Why, why, tell 'em that it's my good nature
Why, why, when I do that way
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
Started as a seed from the semen
When I'm locked down beggin' you for porno fleeks
Sneak weed in, helped a nigga passed the time
