Let's be friends…
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
What's the haps, baby? Come get with me and perhaps, lady
You can help me multiply my stacks, baby
Currency seems small, I need companionship
Through with that scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin', motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my résumé, sippin' on Cristal and Alize
Smokin' on big weed,
keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin', but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin' nappy head bitch
Understand this: Ain't no nigga like me,
fuck Jay Z!
He broke
and I smoke daily, baby, let's be friends
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Back in time, I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
Fuck Dre! Tell that bitch he can kiss my ass!
Can you imagine me in player mode? Rush the tricks
I got her ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch
Fuck player hatin' niggas, ‘cause they cockblock
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
Make money, take money!
