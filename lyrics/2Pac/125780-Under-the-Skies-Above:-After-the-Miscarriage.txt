My child is out there somewhere
under the skies above
waiting anxiously 4 u and me
2 bless it with our love
Sometimes in my dreams
I imagine what it would be like
How could I properly guide him
when even I don't know what's right
Whether he is born in wealth or poverty
there will be no deficiency in love
I welcome this gift of life
given from GOD under the skies above
