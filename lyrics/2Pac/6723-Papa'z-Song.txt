Daddy's home...
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
For you to be comin home talkin that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
So when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry
For all this time (I'm so sorry)
For all this time
For all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
For all this time (so, sorry)
For all this time
For all this time, so sorry baby!
[Verse 2: Wycked]
Moms had to entertain many men;
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
that "Born to be a father" shit
Now that I finally found you, stay the fuck away from me
You're so sorry
