Whassup, boo? Swear I'll never call you bitch again
Damn – gave my homie 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin' 'bout this shit we been through
We close like kin, but you remain my friend too
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Swear I can't live with you
But without you, every day I miss you
Yesterday I called you names and played games on your mind
I promise that I'll change in time
We came too far to throw it all away
Tryin' to get my money on strong
So an early riser out before them other guys
That's the way to profit every time
Plus we been beefin' with the East Coast, with casualties
Cristal corks are popped, romantic thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic, ‘cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me
We came too far to throw it all away
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
To grow up, ya know what I'm sayin'?
That was way back then
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work, boo?
I know you been feelin' pain, things are not the same
Waitin' to exhale while I'm sittin' in the county jail
Who can I trust? And if I bust, will she snitch?
Pictures of us kissin' in the livin' room, in the nude
We came too far, to throw it all away
We came too far to throw it all away
