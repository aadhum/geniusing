Makaveli
Fo all my dogs out there raisin hell
Just to see a young nigga raise tha mail
After the fire comes tha rain
After pleasure there’s pain
Even though we're broke for the moment
We'll Be Ballin’ again
Sophisticated, and this fuckin’ misbehavior
Thug Life tattered on tha bottom of my belly
Indo
I keep a 3-5-7
Bellisimo
Me, 2pacalypse all I know how to do iz ball ball ball!!!
Survive reincarnation after I’m dead
