Got me heartbroken, fine,
so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed,
we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die....
[machinegun shots/Sirens]
Until the day I die.....
We continue growing, one day at a time...
Cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
You know, it's like I'm livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowing if I'm worthy
Living life thinking no man can hurt me...
We continue growing, one day at a time...
We continue growing, one day at a time...
We continue growing, one day at a time...
