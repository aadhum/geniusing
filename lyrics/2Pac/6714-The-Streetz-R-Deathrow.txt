Growing up as an inner city brotha
Where every other had a pops and a motha
poor momma can't control me
"Quit tryin' to save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies!"
A ticken timebomb
Could care less death or success
Is what I quest cause I'm fearless
Now the streets are deathrow
(cause I'll beat you down like it ain't nothin')
The streets are deathrow
I just murdered a man, I'm even more stressed wearin' a vest
Hand on the trigga
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
Must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in the state pen
Who swore I'd wouldn't live till twenty
I'm startin' to loose my hair cause I worry
Hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
I'm dangerous when drunk I only drink beer
Gin makes me sin
Unable to think clear
Henessey makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM
Some call me crazy but this is what you gave me
Amongst the babies who raised up from the slavery
I sport a vest and hit the sess to kill the stress
Moved out west
and I invest in all the best
Those who test will find a bullet in they chest
Put to rest by a brotha who was hopeless
Grow up broke on the rope of insanity
How many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
I'm sick of being tired
Sick of the sirens, body bags, and the gun firing
Tell Bush, "Push the button!" cause I'm fed
Tired of hearin' these voices in my head
The streets are deathrow
