Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these narcs
Be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin raises on niggas when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama
I've been slicin motherfuckerss since I lost my momma
cluk-clow-cluk-clow
It makes no sense to smell like shit
If old ass George could be Washing-tons
through the 1-8-7
