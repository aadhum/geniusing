Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin
In a six-one Chevy
still heavy in this game, can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
hit 'em up
WESTSIDE
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
right?
I done did it all, everywhere I go, I ball
Precisely my game tight, or for so I fall
I found nothing but money rules
Time and space
