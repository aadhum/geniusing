Secrets of war
Get your pen and pads out, you lil' young ass muthafuckas
My melody is music that's corrupt as a felony
Like Sun Tzu or Machiavelli
The secrets of war, the art of combat, bustin' will never fail me
Now Rule 1: Follow yo' enemies
and peep his weakness
Constitute while he's asleep and make the game deeper
Rule 2: Locate his crew, and peep the things they do
no win sit-yay-tions
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about 50 times
You'll have enough game to roll up to the club or somethin'
