Dave Duke sure look cute in that black suit Oooohhh
But even cuter behind the barrel of my six shooter ooh
You look worried cause I ain't buried
Punks leave in a hurry cause I throw flurries making mothafuckas, scurry
I stay strapped, and love to jack those that slang that crack misery
Cause being a nigga means you love niggas
But how could you love niggas if you trying drug niggas?
You motherfuckas need your caps peeled
Cause when blacks kill blacks we stay trapped and thats, real
And we don't need no more statistic's
It's time to get more realistic for the young the black and the gifted
