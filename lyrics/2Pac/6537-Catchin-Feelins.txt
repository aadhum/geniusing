Ahahha all my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down (never)
Ahahah yeah!, my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Uh, yeah!, my homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
now Biggie tell me who do you fear?
Ain't a livin' soul breathin' shall pump no fear here
So many follow but can't reach me, caught in the maze
Catch them, mimickin' my style tryin' to walk this way
Impossible my posse droppin' you
we Death Row riders
No need to beg, motherfucker, ain't no mercy inside us
Feelin' blessed, the richer I get, the more I stress
Smokin' lye watchin' time fly, waitin' for death
Dear God I been feelin' like I'm close to Jesus
Paranoid with my pistols close, smokin' trees
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me
Watchin' niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed
Me, a mercenary for the streets
check my pedigree
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit, then get to squealin'
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Picture me sippin' on 1-5-1
We take the gospel from Makaveli, pass it around
We started the thug trend, the game is ours
Now we coast together, put our thoughts together
Won't question when we die together
Cause the hour soon to come
Kadafi trained soldier, I show you how to use your gun
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
[Verse 3: EDI-Mean]
We yellin' "M-A-D-E N-I-double G-As
Representin' all the real niggas stuck in the trap
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
Instead of puttin' on the armor, niggas put on skirts
These drugs ain't helpin', it only makin' it worse
And the streets ainâ€™t got nothing for me but a hearse
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
My homeboys might squabble but we don't fall down
Niggas hide like hoes when we hit your town
