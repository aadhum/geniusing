Yo c'mon man, what do you mean you don't wanna ride with me, nigga
C'mon, get in the car, get in the fuckin' car, man
Yo why you trippin' man? Get in the fuckin' car, man
Get in the fuckin' car.. get in the car
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car
'Cause you, you think niggas gon' be blastin' at it
It ain't even that deep baby)
they Outlawz on the Row
Five shots changed my whole life
Niggas die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Latin Quarters
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck
Quit bullshit nigga 'cause I'm still fuckin' yo' bitch
Y'all remember "Hit 'Em Up," don't make us do it once more
'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin' car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God, nigga
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin' I'ma fuckin' ball for ya
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
I've been drinkin' on the daily, I can hardly remember
I sleep light, I wake peekin' out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
