The next heavy weight champion of the world
I won't deny it I'm a straight rider
Ain't no stopping me
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Wanna see me cuffed up and call the cops on me
On a mission to be champs since they let me free
So why you suckers keep boxing me?
Though not guilty I'm still in jail
who's the next to get knocked out
