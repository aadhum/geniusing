This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Now we've been kickin' it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Sippin' Alize and Cristal, whylin' every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police
I never call you bitch or ho'
Born through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
Just keep your faith in God, knowin' you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin' and talkin', a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Watchin' the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meanin' of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
