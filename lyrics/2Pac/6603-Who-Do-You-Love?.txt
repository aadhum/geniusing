Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs
And runnin from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, till my ass die
Fuckin with them tramp-ass sluts you supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you, all up in the skirt
Now you lookin like a jerk cause she hurt you
Now head's up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Steady smokin indo, goin cra-zy
Everybody's talkin 'bout they, KNOW ME
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin homies
Tell me what you need when you, SEE ME
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number baby call me when you lone-ly
and strapped with my fo'-five
Cause you can lose it in the gutter
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
