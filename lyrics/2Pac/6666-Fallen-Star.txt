Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah)
Turn me up, turn me up, turn me up, what (yeah, what, yeah, uh)
Pack your cannons we outlandishly brandish the weapons
Meet Jamaican like you god {U-god?} and 'em handing you lessons
We learn a lot from the 60's like glaring 13 necks
Mainly the niggas get shot for flaring out their larynx
And get to speakin' on a conditions of black people
That's illegal they enforce it with the force that's lethal
Make you wanna grab a gun and throw the all black gear on
Head to congress exercising your constitutional right to bear arms
Leather jackets and glasses and you can tell it's us
The FBI probably bust a nut if we self destruct
Call it militant but ain't nobody killing Barry {Goldwater}
You can't be militant if you ain't got no military
But it's still a very powerful word
Picture some niggas with guns, got 'em very disturbed, word
This is for Medgar Evers, Martin, and my brother Malcom
The value of life is so cheap if your skin ain't talcum
We need leaders, we looking at entertainers
That ain't gangsta nigga, you the opposite of Huey P
Blessed by the creator so give money nigga
Eazy-E, still here (still here)
My man Justo (still here)
Big L (still here)
Big Pun (still here)
We lost our Big Poppa and our baby girl
