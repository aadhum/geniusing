Heaven ain't hard to find
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hopin' my information, alleviates the hesitation
Although I know you've heard about my reputation
Across the nation, Mr. I-get-around
Never gettin' but wantin', never touchin' but wishin'
A straight thug on a mission, until I get what I'm missin'
Turn around one more time, heaven ain't hard to find
Heaven ain't hard to find
In fact you can have it just have faith
And have you ever made love
With candles and bubbles sippin' in your tub ?
Touch me and let me activate your blood pressure
Picture me naked and glistenin' beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that Aliz√©
And maybe we can be better friends, perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life, baby, and you'll be my soldier
You think we all dogs, that's why you cautious when I approached you
Been talkin' since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
It's like the closer you get
Baby, the quicker I'm speakin'
I got a flight out to Cabo
Let's kick it this weekend
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
I'm makin' love to your mind, baby
