"You could get the finger.. the middle!" {​*1}​
You could get the finger...the middle!
they ban my album
point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
Wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
Them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
sesame
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell n
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
Of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
