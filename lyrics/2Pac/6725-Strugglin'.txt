["Stick up, stick up, stick up kids...
Still don't nothin' move but the money"]
Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Money Bags
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
I'm fifty niggas deep beat sleep
With a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
Three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggas need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
