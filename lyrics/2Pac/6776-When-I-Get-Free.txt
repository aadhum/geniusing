Is it a, frame up, tryin' to keep me out the game, stuck
Networkin' with connects that I got in the Pen'
In no time, I'll be clockin' again
J. Valentine
Still sittin' in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin' to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash quick
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin' maybe
Me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin' me baby
To a young motherfucker facin' eighty that's enough to make you crazy
Got her watchin' me liftin' weights, sneakin' looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives the van
Stuck in my cell
The Pen' ain't nuttin like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin' knees in the back of a limousine, puffin' on weed
