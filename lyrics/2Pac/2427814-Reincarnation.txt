This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
My role model was a cold bottle of O.E
Surrounded by my closest homies but nobody knows me
In case you see me out in traffic, looking nervous and high
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition be my prophecy I hope it's heard
And you know that shit that happens to the Teflon,
This composition is my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition is my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition is my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition is my prophecy I hope it's heard
This composition is my prophecy I hope it's heard
[Outro: Lemika]
And this Lemika and I'd like to give a shoutout to all the tray-whizz kids out and I'm appreciating how I'm chilling up in the studio with 2Pac and Cocoa G and uh -laughs- Okay I'm out..
I'm done, I went out, Oh Shit, put this back
