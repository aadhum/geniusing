"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin'
Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin' down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin'
But I'll be hustlin' 'til the early mornin' cause I'm strugglin'
Gettin' pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a ho, make the dough
Break a ho when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin' down the block lickin' shots at the punk-ass *cops*
And spittin' game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
zoo niggas
They're quick to pull a nine when it's time do niggas
fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin' drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin' for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin' for a nut but I'm searchin' for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
In a one-room shack, and, kickin' back
fo'-five
cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
Gettin' swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin' trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
one-time
Niggas don't like me cause I'm makin' ends
Roll in a Benz
I blaze a blunt
And any nigga tryin' to take what I got'll
Hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin' shit from no niggas
I'm just tryin to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin' food in my tummy right
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker every single day"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker every single day"
"Tis the season, to be servin'"
"Mob-mobbin' like a motherfucker every single day"
"Tis the season... to be servin'"
(Warren G fuckin' with that one nigga)
