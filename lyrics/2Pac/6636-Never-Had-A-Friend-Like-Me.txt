See, at night I watch the sky
I take another breath
I smoke my Newport to the butt
Like it's the last motherfucker left
Just me and you evading enemies
Let you get my last shot of Hennessy
Ain't never had a friend like me
Remember memories so vividly
Was once a little dust kicker now becomes a G
Who can I call when they all fail
Collect calls to my dogs from the county jail
Sending me mail
Heard the block's in the same shape
Ain't nothing changed
Niggas slanging at the same place
The same faces
Suppose to always hate our foes
This lifestyle lives forever
Watch the game unfold
Shedding crocodile tears
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
in this act of war
More casualties, no survivors
Any man that defies, quickly dies 'cause we riders
In my quest for chips
We wear vests, equipped with automatic fire
We reply when my enemies trip
Me and you against the nation
Whispering while we conversatin'
'Cause niggas died over information
How much more can we take
Expect us all to wait
The world ain't ready for us yet so let's make Clinton pay
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
Promise to visit
I know it's rough in your cell
Receiving mail to the county jail
This is hell
When I was younger
I could picture livin'
In luxury
So how the fuck did I end up in prison
Fuckin' snitches
They got me crossed by my own side
I found him by his self
No drama, he alone die, nobody cry
Should have never testified
You got my nigga 25
So now I sacrifice your life
Help to separate me and my dog
Broken ties, why the fuck should I let you live
When I'm dead inside?
Rapid fire my delivery
I'm bustin' at they whole crew
Nigga, remember me
Hit up my Outlawz set
Then throw my pistol in the ocean
Ditch my ski mask
And get to straight coastin'
It's visitin' day at San Quinton
Always there to see your closest roaddog
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
I'm down for you so ride with me
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't ever had a friend like me
Nobody knows where we'll be
My enemy's your enemy
'Cause you ain't never had a friend like me
