Daz in this, motherfucker
Travel through my mind, am I blind it's a shame
As I sit here puffin' on a cigarette
Gotta be ready, never know who's plottin' on a niggas death
everybody's strapped
While you starvin' and broke they pullin' six figures
Oooh, what can you do?
When you can't trust your crew
Time to bust out the twenty-two
Ran out of weed, so I'm sippin' on this Hennessy
As I take another sip of my liquor and spit my sick thoughts, oooh
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Thuggin' to the fullest, got my strap, I'ma pull it
I'm the first muh'fucker that can outrun a bullet
Now my riches is gettin' hoes on it's own
Fuck a mystery, do you wanna get with me, then let's bone
I'ma take her to my hideout, cause I'm smokin' that spinach
I gotta get mine
Hell nah, nigga, have to plug me twice
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Me and my bitch named Nina are fiendin' tonight
But playa haters can't fade me
Tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Yeah, constantly runnin' from danger ain't no stranger to cop cars
Gettin' arrested and tested wearin' a vest and don't drop my guards
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
Now tell me do you see
Life's so hard on a nigga when you livin' like a G
These motherfuckin' po-po's and these pink folks got it all locked up for us to fail.
