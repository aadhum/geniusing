Cuts a duck, fuck "Naughty" I'm in that hate ya "Nature"
Rip "This and That" like Dres'll a due
I feel we cut your hair short
Go fetch a Treach, I make him disappear like Etch A Sketch
Quickly I used to wreck shit, but now punk I'm on some next shit
FUCK A GHETTO BASTARD
"hey ho"
End up with a halo
Looks like a TKO
say no, to Treachery
Naughty kids always get a spankin
Never let a breeze, slow me down kid this ain't the season
Let's beat the nuts up
Talking about Twisting don't impress you, like your shit is all that
