Flowin the lyrical magic of mine I be moppin and sweepin
And breakin em up and then makin em break in a sweat
I be makin em jump and then sit up and lift the style
I be kickin and poppin the rhythm I'm rockin and pumpin
The lyrics I put up inside em be makin em rock
And a flow of the rhythm I'm bringin into the mic
I'm gonna give em a concept
