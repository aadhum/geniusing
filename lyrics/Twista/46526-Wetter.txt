I'm calling you daddy, daddy
Can you be my daddy? Daddy
I need a daddy, daddy
Won't you be my daddy? Daddy
With a '97 +Pimp+ flow, got a feelin
When you smokin when I flip it to a Trax beat
Talkin about a beautiful figure, astonishing as Greek mythology
Body be just like the girl in uhh, what's that movie?
Never mind,
Still a playa know you got it when you climbin
From the bottom to the top of the pole
Yo' phatty's so accurate when I'm smackin it
I'mma be yo' weatherman
Cause every time I'm lookin up and I see more ass
I'mma constantly see rain in the forecast
This-a-way, that-a-way, I'm flickin 5000 Ones
Or whatever you wanna call it
You done been good, but you can do better
I done been wet, but I can get it wetter
Come and make it rain down onnnn meeeeeee
Touch your ears and your neck and play wit'cha pearls
Then I reach up in your pants and play wit'cha pearl
white stuff
Now you got me excited, I can't hold it
I'm feelin it comin, I'm 'bout to let off an explosion
