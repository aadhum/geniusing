I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
Dark matter aka melanin
Outer space black power, Zulu!
Yelling out like Louie, yelling out moo-boo
Yelling out like Wayne, yelling out soo-woo
Take it to a whole 'nother motherfucking level
When I say I made that ho
In the beginning there was "Adam", A-T-O-M
I am the Higgs Boson, meaning that I was there way before him
I kick logic, science
Astrological when I be spitting you a verse
Bio photons turning on codons
I’m a beast, boy, with an intergalactic flow
