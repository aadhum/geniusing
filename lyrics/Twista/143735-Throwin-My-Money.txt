In the club throwin' money
Turned up, Kells and the Twista
The way she work it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
They way she twerk it on the pole
Got me throwin' my money, throwin' my money
how you be attractin' plenty dudes with the Jimmy Choo shoes you in
What you doing takes some talent so I gotta say that I'm enjoying what I witness
I'm throwin' dollars cause it look like she finna hit her head
My money no limit, tonight I'm about to go astronaut
Never ride solo, Mr. Franklin always with me
