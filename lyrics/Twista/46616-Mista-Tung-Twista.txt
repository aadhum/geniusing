Watch the lyrical flow
I'mma give em a concept
Heeeeey
What's happenin, y'all?
This is Tyrone Chilifoot
So turn up your radio and get down to the Tung Twista
Kick it, gee
Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the
Mista Tung Twista
slowly
Flowin this from my lung, a tongue twister
Nubian
Don't dis the Tung Twista
???
My tongue is spinnin
Flow of the lyric I'm pumpin and rappin em up is dope as a crack fix
then to mentally
I'm as dope as a pharmacist
The funk of the lyric will flow from me like peepee
You caught a work of my tongue as I be flow flowin like water
Yeah - Tung Twista
????
Played to the left by def and I'm gonna eff up the right half
???
