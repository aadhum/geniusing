I'm.. bringing pain like two bad nurses
To the dirt shit first picks and use'n autos to work with
I'm a misunderstood nigga, and I'm off my square
Iâ€™m charged-up like Scarface gettin' shot up on the ledge
No pain, instead of 'caine I took a blunt off to the head
I feel the reefer rushin
Make me wanna slip the clip on the side
That's your adrenaline rush
Like when a motherfucker have to go pick up the pump
To make his opposition chest kick up and jump
When you lit up the gun to make your body get up and uhh
That's your adrenaline rush
Start up buryin some heads like an ostrich
And unload the whole cartridge
And throw the shells out the garbage
Yungbuck's my accomplice
Located his existence with my sixth sense, like a compass
And starting on a journey established to stop this
And even though I'm still bleedin
I'ma keep comin because I'm still breathin
And y'all can't trace me
I bury my victims in the wall like Gacy, too lyrical
And since its nipple my umbilical these flows is critical
This music is miracle it's like I'm biblical
Killin like I'm nuttier than buddy love
And still wouldn't leave a bloody glove
And speed the fuck up
Getaway, smokin this blunt
Dump the adrenaline eruptin my viens I'm pumped up
See that's 300 niggas that gon die, bout 60 slugs to do this deed
I'm the worstest
Look about 9 millimeters above your surface
