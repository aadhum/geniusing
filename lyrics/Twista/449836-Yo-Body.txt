Then I gotta up wit big d and six freaks
They was thick as hell, you understand me?
I was sipping on Patron about to fade out
Got up wit lil ma, had the whole lick layed out
If you was a car, girl you'd be a phantom
I was chose in this game
To be a cold mothafucka with the fe's and the lad's
Gurl, you got a banging body like a Bugatti
Who the one that saw the body wit the booty of a Maserati
You be kinda reminding me of a Maybach
