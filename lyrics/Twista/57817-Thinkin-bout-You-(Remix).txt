A tornado flew around my room before you came
Sadder than purple rain memory's got me cryin' like a dove
No, I don’t like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don’t love you, I just thought you were cute
That’s why I kiss you
Got a fighter jet, I don’t get to fly it, though
I’m lyin’ down thinkin’ ’bout you
Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget?
How you feel
And though you were my first time
A new feel
It won’t ever get old, not in my soul
Not in my spirit, keep it alive
We’ll go down this road
‘Til it turns from color to black and white
