On the porch, on the porch
Smokin reefa
Hmmm yeah
I woke up early Saturday morning sick off Rhemy and brews
Wit a hang over from blues
Hurl on my clothes and shoes stomach on wooz
From this killer weed that's so fired it made your nose bleed
I had me so high, my brain was fried movin at slow speed
This thick bitch chose me and was stickin like liquor
She look to tight that bodies right my heart and mind was like "Dick her"
But wit my body aching from hurl sensation that's got me shaken
I swiftly took the number and passed on ass that was for the taken
In the summer I hit the front porch wit a morning B
Sippin on the duce duce OZ
Wit a treat under the seat
Dougie
