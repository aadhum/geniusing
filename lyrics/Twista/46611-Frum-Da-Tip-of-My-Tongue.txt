[ Lyrics taken from CD-Booklet ]
Droppin' a flow like this be breakin' the suckers
makin' em manifest that I be rockin' the young
Flowin' this style I be singin' and bringin'
It's breakin' the people and go in the mind of a teen
Quick the lyrical style I'mma kick
You better catch the rhythm of it
Cause hip-hop is becomin' complicated, never be left hung
Bringin' a style like this kinda quick and crisp
A lyrical twist be comin' up from Chi-Town
I know that hip-hoppers all over that'll be stung
(How was the rhyme brung?)
Frum the tip of my tung (7X)
(How was the rhyme brung?)
Frum among the tip of my tung
Rock the style of my second verse like that of my first
Be showin' the hip-hop hypes my types of flowin', but not the best of T
From an imagination this was took, a mental crook
Think I'm a lyrical midget, watch me then say fee-fi-fo-fum
