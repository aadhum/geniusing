"When I wake in the morning love..
And the sunlight hurts my eyes..
And something without warning love..
Bears heavy on my mind.."
I keep my mind on my money, money on my mind
I got my finger on the trigger, stayin on the grind
I can serve 16 ounces plus 6 and get back 96
It's a lovely day,
I got a - clip full of hollows,
With dreams of ownin a record label
It's a lovely day,
Got love for the corporate playas that's ballin rollin Jags
And if I can't legally make a knot
Then I gotta get right back on the block
It's a lovely day,
It's a lovely day,
