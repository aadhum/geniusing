Twista, first time I kicked it off with "Adrenaline Rush"
I just wanted 'em to see what my CD was like
Hip-Hop is in a state as if it was a baby bein' murdered
I just wanna feed it poetry pedialyte
I'm a black revolutionary in hip-hop
I just wanna hit the earth like a meteorite
Now droppin lyrical bombs upon the planet
And just get a little dust and avoid all the media hype
Fuck the drama I'm just campaignin Chi right
Niggas feel like they position is better than mine
But I stay on a mission,
