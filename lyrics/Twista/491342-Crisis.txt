[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
Michael Myers, man I'm mental
Messy murder
Mediocre motherfuckers my motive makin' minimum
Maniacal makin' me mesh my line
MONSTER! Musical massacre
Metaphysical minion may never match my grind
When I'm bustin' you think I'm poppin' the E
Look at the K.O.D. demolish, I’m polished
You will never see the light of day right away
You will die
Soo-Woo
what the?
Out with the weak and in with the raw
I did it to death and my nigga I got to go!
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you don’t know the truth
We are an anomaly
coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
Tech got his face painted
Whenever you recollect it, me and Tech will tackle niggas
And see ’em like Liam Neeson in Taken
Or Taken 2, better yet,
Tekken 2
Wrecking you like I was Baek or Eddy
I'm ready to reappear like I was Yoshimitsu
It's a crisis and a murder whenever you see both of us in the booth
It can be an interpretation of a catastrophic event
Of verbal annihilation if you don’t know the truth
We are an anomaly
coupling up and stomping them up in the gut
Tech got his face painted
