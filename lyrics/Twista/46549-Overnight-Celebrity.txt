Oh you didn't think we could do it again
Twista, Kanye West, from Po Pimpin' to Poppin' Tags
From Champions to Slow Jammin', oh baby
We can even make you a overnight celebrity
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Girl I see you in them Apple Bottom jeans
Chinchilla on your back, I wanna know your name
Girl I'm Twista, I could blow your brains
Put you in a chameleon '04 Range
Still sexy when you smoke that flame
Jerk it like a chicken when you throw that thang
She got me hotter than a oven the way that she talk
Switching to freaky so I'm loving the way that she walk
You looking good, girl, you oughta be in pictures
Listen to me, I see your career going sky high
Taking you home to the crib in the Chi
And everytime I see your thighs I cry when I drive by
Watching you should be a thrill, got the fellas on some Johnny Gill
Steady screaming "my, my, my, my"
Walk on the carpet with the diamonds that flick in the dark
Kicking it on the couch at 106 & Park
I can see your beauty on the big screen
I can see me freaking you with whipped cream
I can see you on stage at the awards
With a dress better than Jennifer's and doing big things
You looking good girl, show you right
Dre told me you the prototype
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
You want fame, you can take that path
Candlelights 'fore you take a bath
I'mma get you Jimmy Choo and Marc Jacob bags
I can cop her a 2003
Make her smile when she sees Spre's
I can get you on CDs and DVDs
Take you to BeBe's and BCBG
I can get you into places to be into
The people to know or show you things to get into
And protect you from others, don't ever let a brother pimp you
Y'all take a look at her, she got such an astonishing body
I can see ya in some Gucci or Robert Cavalli
And you get on top of me and have a brother going "oh-oh"
Why don't we play something these hoes'll like?
Drive whips I know they like
Twista, you told her, right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
Give you ice like Kobe wife
We sorta like Goldie, right
The way we mold 'em right
I could make you a celebrity overnight
I'mma get you to the MTV awards
I can even get you to the Soul Train awards
