woofas
And I got the tech and a machete for the niggas actin' petty
I'm a pump both up with ammunition
Roll on 24's when I'm on your tip
That be ready for whatever with a whole war chest if a nigga run up
Ak 47, desert eagle, sk, mac 11 for the niggas that'll try to run up
Nigga what ya want I'm a bone thug get you while your sleeping
Cause you know I'm creepin on ah come up
Got the Desert Eagle
Tell me where your jewelry at
Where your safe
Don't make me have to smack this ugly bitch in her face
Is it behind the portrait or is it
In your floor just let me know so that I can hit it up
Cause I gots to go
And because I spit that crack is the reason we got some change
How we constantly come up with hits and steady be gettin fans
Is only because a nigga flows sick
Showin no debate everybody know I'm great
