chrome, leather, and wood
Woke up next to a peanut butter and a caramel chick
Feeling fucked up, flicked out, freaked on
Thinking about my new truck with the deep dish
Meaning deep chrome, deep chrome, in the deep dome
After a massage and a menage, we got in the shower
Let water trickle down the brack of the cack of they booty
One put on prada
one put on Ludi
I put on Gucci
Duty calls
Issey Miyaki
Wax on, wax off like Mr. Miagi
Go to the liquor store so I can get blunts, get Yak
So I can sip some while I split one
Chronicle enter ever follicle of my body
Calming down every molecule, making sure I don't trip none
Hit one
Hop in the ride, come and kick it with me
So I can take you through the so-and-so hundred block
And show you how my people be kicking it in the windy city
While we sit on leather gripping wood
pimps got 'Lacks
flip twenty's, flip twenty one's
Flip twenty two's, flip Jordans, flip two-fours
hundred-forty spokes
I could roll my vehicle to Texas
And spit it like, this is for the syrup sippers
Ride to this while you peel, yo, hood
I spit some game wit the intellect, to the media, like I'm in the Encyclopedia Brittanica
Come and take over the world with me girl, if you good I might can see if I can be your manager
smocking on some fire, galactic dro
K-Town
