I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says "Ye shall prosper"
I am such a Mobsta
The Bible says "Ye shall prosper"
This ain't a legend or folklore
Chi-raq violence is real, not a Cold War
And do not open your mouth unless you spoke for
Please Father forgive me
I had to give him two to the kidney
hangin out with Windy City gratefuls
In the back of the club we play pool
Only real niggas cause they cool
But now-a-days family come first
Shorties out here is gettin killed over turf
Well if the meek shall inherit the earth
Tell me why I gotta know what a hundred bricks is worth?
...Ah, flow so gorgeous
The coldest to ever touch a cordless
I'm on the streets Forbes List
And with the rhymes I'm divine like Osiris, Horus
It's a clash of the titans
Warriors on the street blastin and fightin'
Seen it all, been a part of it all
Don't get it twisted if I'm on a different path when I'm writin
Blowin loud by the quarter
