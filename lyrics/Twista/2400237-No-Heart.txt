Now when it comes to blowin' dro you know I got's the bomb
Quick to dump these bullets up in your ass like Lebron
Got me bustin' at these haters, I'm a motherfucking killa
Just call me the West Side Mobster, I'm your real ass nigga
Motherfuckas try to play me cause they know I get my cash on
Do a 187 with this motherfuckin' mask on
Jumpin' up outta the truck
Deep as the bass on this bomb beat
Tore his dome apart, left his brains on the concrete
Never catch me slippin', cause I'm known to keep a trey pound
They hated since the very start, so I shitted on the game
And I catch bullets in the field like Randy Moss (moss)
I'm the face of L.A, got L.A on my face
Hydraulics in the trunk, and the cake by the safe
I wear hoodies for real, you wear hoodies like Pharrell
Pharrell got pastell colors on him
I got a TV in the Range showing colors on it
Toast for my nigga Shyne in the pen
