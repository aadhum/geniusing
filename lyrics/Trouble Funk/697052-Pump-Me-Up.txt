And when checkin' out the others that dress so mean
They put me in the mind of a Mr. Cardin
But Calvin Kline seems to come through
Until Yves St Laurent walks up to GQ
But that's not it, they still want more
So I send them down to Studio 54
Say Jordache, Bonâ€™jour, Cassini, Sassoon
I've got the jeans that make the tunes
Like Perry Mason gonna solve the case
