Better flee the scene
That's on the real
Better keep that head down
Pullin' out a pocket knife
Will get you snyped
Nigga thought he had him a sweet vic
But he had him a schizophrenic
Ms. Hay she cooked as punkin pie
Gettin' high in the fuckin' barn
You came to close to the Style, partner
Can't fuck with the rodeo
Look you up in your eyes and spray
Making motherfuckers recognize the flavor
Coming from Chi-Town
