Shoulda broke it to the left man
I was born to be a PIMP!
Never lovin' no hoes, never no half-steppin
Never caught off my square
Was the knowledge I (???) to the left side
Went under(??? walkin???)well, hangin on the curb puffing herb
Straight hustlin NIGHT and DAY,gotta get my nine
Strappin up my Glock and hoody, I'm lookin for goodys on your block
This is a stick up
You best to give it up to the right, thats them gangstas concept
But thats cool, get your money, but I'm gone break it to the left
I'mma tell ya momma,daddy did it with the flu and I thought you knew it
bang my shit to the left side
I was only 15 years old, never handlin a vice lord steady growing
I learn my shit from the niggas comin up in that county ward
Blastin at the niggas on the other side
Picking up the trigger when you come up right?
Ain't no love what love got to do with it
Bitches gone get you caught up, fighting over them hoes
She be giving up the pussy left and right
I could've fucked that ho last night
45 automatic if you want to get off your chest
trickhead
Run up on a goddamn Lunatic
one slick so you want the dub
Specially
Cuz I kept my shit tight,niggas talkin bout we used to fight
Nigga
bring they bullet proofs wit mace
gat
Tanqueray
Flipin I think I'll never do, to the right thats tight but I'mma stay
In the cradle, if ya able
Break it to the left man
