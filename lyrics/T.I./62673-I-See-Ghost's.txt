Hey I think I seen a ghost
Half a million dollar car, ain't even got no note
Bitches layin' on the bed, bitches on the flo'
Money to the ceiling, money come and money go
I think I seen a ghost, I think I seen a ghost
Hamiltons and Franklins, they come in every show
Money to the ceiling, how you love you can go
Graveyard in my pockets, dead presidents to blow
I think I'm seeing ghosts
in Fulton County'
set
Give me more, Demi Moore
Got my green from the Bay
