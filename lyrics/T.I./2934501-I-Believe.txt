all i can
Believe M-L-King had a dream for real
He in Heaven ,and we be dealing with demons still
The death of Bob Marley & Malcom X
Pac n Biggie too , but i ain't really sure about dat
Chorus
All your plans ain't worth for damn
Cause in front of God, you are just a man
Wanna take advantage of a lesser man
Build a wall, keeping out the mexicans
Go to standing rock and wanna poison water, just like Michigan
Now ain't this a bitch
