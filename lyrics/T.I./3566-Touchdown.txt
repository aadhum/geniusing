When we touch down,
(in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass)
Atlanta
go bananas, Alabama
'weesiana
Ten-a-keys
(Go right from the plane to the Range)
When we touch down
(On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we)
Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down
one hundred E-X-double R
You barkin' up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on tryin' me, I put that beam right on your tater (pow!)
Try to keep him in a cage, but somehow he keep escapin'
Virgin Island I be takin'
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lyin', you're mistaken
When we touch down,
in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
(Atlanta
go bananas, Alabama
'weesiana
Ten-a-keys
Go right from the plane to the Range
(When we touch down)
On a private plane, gettin' brains, 'til we
(Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Welcome to the Midwest, yes, where them Detroit playas ball
Like you have no idea,
candy painted
Frogger
They hoppin' out of the way
Whenever they see Marshall's car comin'
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
swirl pops
And I got the bass thumpin'
krumpin'
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, "Dad, this is in, so you're with the trends."

Touch down, there ain't no way to keep 'em quiet
With T.I. and Shady, baby
We 'bout to incite a riot when we touch down
From my arrival, until my departure
d-i-c-k
I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
How could they be so ignorant?
Look what hip-hop done brung us!
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
So excuse me, Oprah, honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just bein' honest
For that am I being punished?
Now, I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
yellin' and screamin'
When we touch down,
in the Midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
