leprechaun ass nigga
Like a pussy nigga named Lil' Wesley, tryna test me
Say I wanna rap on your songs but you ain't let me
See you on the front of The Source, like that upset me
Nigga, lyrically I'll murk you
Physically I'll hurt you
You ain't never ran the streets, you had a curfew
Better find a nigga to try, nigga I ain't the one
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
This pussy nigga wanna beef well he find him some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one (ha, hey, hey)
I said, I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Fuck, boy you wanted beef, well you found you some
I got 99 problems, Lil Flip ain't one
Pussy nigga, shut the fuck up
I'm cool with Face and even he know that you're a sucker
Paul Wall runnin' Texas along with Slim Thug
Mike Jones, ESG, and Z-Ro some real hustlers
Never been a Botany Boy, you just a buster
Nigga Hump said he made you put on the mothafucking leprechaun suit, nigga
You talkin' bout you got rich off that shit, nigga
You ain't even get no car nigga till this next album
Lil Flip, man, will you get me one of them bow tie's and one of them top hats, nigga, please, I need one
A glitter bow ties, and one of them top hats
I want... This halloween I wanna be the leprechaun, this halloween
Could I please get a glitter bow tie and a top hat, please?
[Lil Flip]
And I'll adore you, I'll treat you like milk
I'll do nothing but spoil you
