Hey, I know shit get kinda fucked up some times, you know
I know you can get carried away with yourself
But uh, why don't you be real with me
And be real with you at the same time?
You can't get what you get here nowhere else ma
Keep it real now
You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know, you love
Bitch you know you love this life
Don't nobody do you like me
You know
We live how we wanna live cos we got mills
In VIP dem bottle popping do it B.I.G
Girlfriends see your bag, be like where you find that?
Plus, what the fuck's a prenup? You ain't gotta sign that
You nut up, take half, I'ma make it right back
Bentley for your birthday,
Goyard purse day
[Verse 2]
Girl you can get another guy to beat that pussy for you
don't bow with me and be patient
And you sadly mistaken if you think I'm into chasing
My heart is RSVP, I've extended an invitation
Don't you love this life like I love you?
Anything you could ask, do it for you
Drop Jags, Birkin bags, Louboutin heels
Summer homes in Miami, Hollywood hills
Vacationin' in Monaco, Ibiza
On the French Riviera with our feet up
A lifestyle so rare
You know you ain't going nowhere
