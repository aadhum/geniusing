Hey, shorty I know you be hearin this and that from here and there
When you're high (for when it's all good), when you're low (to when it's all bad)
Well I promise I will never let you go (now what you call that?)
Said I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (you got my back, right?)
I got, I got, I got, I got your back boy (I know you got my back, right?)
Keep my swagger, keep it lookin good for ya
Hey it's whatever shorty, you ain't gotta ask
Yes
Valentino blouses, summer houses, cash, check
You can get it, you deserve it, flawless diamonds, Louis purses
My mission's to purchase Earth for her
present the gift without the curse
Her pleasure is my purpose, pleasure to be at your service
We front row at fashion shows, as well as Sunday morning service
For better days or for worse, if I'm paid or I'm hurtin
In my pocket
she still got a nigga back, know that's for sure
No matter what may occur in life, everyday with her is like, a plus
I'm a love her 'til she be like "that's enough"
Pop a bottle, get a couple wine glasses, fill 'em up and lift 'em up
Let us toast to the future, here's to us
No, here's to her
They wonder how we do what we do
Panamera Porsches, me and you
Stuck to your side li-li-like glue
Be by your side whatever you goin' through
Hey, this is for the women who, man caught a sentence
They stayed home, waitin on the phone and on visit day
Show up looking good, smelling better, playin kissy face (yeah, yeah)
No bouquet of flowers
Could ever show how much we know we need you
May God say "even Eve and Adam ain't got shit on these two"
Ten million dollar mansions won't suffice
If you ain't gon' be in there with me at night
The pieces to the puzzles in my life
Through all of my good days and all of my bad
You stood by your man and you know you got my back
I know what I got at home, I ain't gon' never leave that
Them bitches best believe that
