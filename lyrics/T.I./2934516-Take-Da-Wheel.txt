People just be sayin what they want up out they mouth
And meanwhile I be tryna keep about as real as I can keep it
You try me and I'm gonna bring that drama to your house
And I pray to god that we can keep this lil' me and you a secret
But if not, gotta hot meal ticket
Said I'll barely see the side of a cell
Smiling, as I post bail
Emerging, for certain
You see it, I'm gods child
Even though Jesus knows I been wild since a fetus
I got a real big heart
And a real bad temper
