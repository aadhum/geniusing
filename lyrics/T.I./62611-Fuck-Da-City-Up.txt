[Hook: Young Jeezy]
This for my niggas on the block dodging one time
Grinding hard, burning up at least one nine
All about that bread, rubberbands on my bankroll
Bankhead, Simpson Road this Atlanta bitch
K, Quarter, half, whole thang nigga like the old days?
I'm no longer poppin' tags I just let 'em hang
Twenty grand in my pants, fifty in my peacoat
Ever see me in the club with my shades off
It was a cool contest I guess the shades lost
28-5 yeah that's my cost
Bitch my closet so big I swear I got lost
What? Yeah I think I'm gon' need a map
Whip it counterclockwise, that's the backstroke
Bitch my chain so big look like my back broke
Bitch I'm balling so hard I need the whole court
Six spots in one night they call it club hopping
Chopper, fifty round clip
Keep it with me, I 'on't slip
Hey boy we spittin, reminiscin' bout when we was in the kitchen
Do it for my nigga Big Meech and B.M.F. nigga
it's shaketown and we turnt up while you sleep
