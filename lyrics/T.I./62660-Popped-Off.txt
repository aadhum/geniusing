We back at it, the wait is over
Dr. Dre, T.I.P.,
This shit is special
See a party ain't a party til the doc walk in it
It's hard to get it started til I hopped off in it
Then it got so crunk one minute
Since you didn't get to witness, just listen
You can leave, if she came to party
Niggas hands in the air, bitches takin' tops off
Put the chronic in the air, and the shit popped off
It's been awhile since you've heard these beats
You're malnourished
But he's back now, to flood these streets
They shall flourish
In fact, this track was on the back burner, it leaked
So back to the lab I had to go
Girl, I hope your vaginal has endurance
Cause I'm about to do somethin' tragical
Cause homie hit the OE flow
you know me from before
But you don't know me like this
I'll have you OD'ing on dick, this belong to your soul
Felonious
I'll kill your loneliness
But only just for, one night
I got a bottle of Mo and fo' mo' lil' mommy's
Lookin' like models, waitin' at the do' inside of my ho-tel
All ready to swallow and yo, follow the flow and traffic to the top flo'
And you gonna smell a lot of Merlot, a lot of chronic for sho
Gin and tonic
Bottles poured, blow a lot of dro, no powder though
Everywhere you tryin' to go, I been a long time ago
Swag done surpassed, my style is so spazz, I pop tags daily
Drop Phantom, four eighty
Walk up in the place, and all the ladies go crazy
Want to get impregnated but all they need is throat babies
I tell 'em, "Kneel down, suck a nigga dick or somethin'"
Rubberband poppin'
Hoppin' out the champagne Rolls, with the automatic do's
Pockets on swoll, both wrists so froze
King of the South, balls out on the West Coast
Aftermath,
