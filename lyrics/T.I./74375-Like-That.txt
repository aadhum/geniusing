They want that young nigga dumb, who you with, where you from shit
That gang banging, rag hanging, what you claiming crunk shit
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) They on that
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) They want that
They want that super gutter ignorant, that new ghetto belligerent
Authentic brick flipping dope boy trap nigga shit
(Hey!) Yeah they like that
(Hey!) They on that
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) Yeah they want that
They want banana clip in, chicken flipping, pistol gripping roll out
Music do that shit so good cause that's the shit I know 'bout
Gang bangers and J's in projects where a nigga stay
In my baby mama Section-8 apartment
If you want it, ho I got it, you can fuck with me or not
Still riding 24's, pockets full of cheddar now
Chevy sitting real high, same clothes still fly
That's the shit them young niggas out there wanna hear about
Gangster walking
See me approach with caution
Louis belt around my waistline, pistol hanging off it
Only thing I got now is the 9 in my lap
Get rich and get out the game 'fore snitches can get to telling
Magician with it Magellan
already a felon
Wee hours of the morn I'mma hustle till it's all gone
Nigga better recognize my grind
Nigga know I spent my whole life in that shit
And still riding with me cause they like that shit
Yeah they like that
(Hey!) They on that
(Hey!) They like that
(Hey!) Yeah they want that
Spit it how I used to live it I ain't writing that shit
Like I'm right in that shit, that's why they like that shit
