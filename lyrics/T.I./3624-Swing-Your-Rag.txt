Alright, okay, I don't dance, no way
I just take my Louis rag out and wave it round in the air
Take my Gucci rag out and wave it round in the air
New Akoo outfit with a Gucci rag
Full of stacks rubberbands round big cash
We in the club homes gettin our thug on
Bottles of Patron if you grown get your buzz on
I'm like the moon I shine and bring the stars out
When it dark out get the squad out
Kimosabe, big ballin is my hobby
I'm boppin while I'm walkin, rag fallin out my pocket
If big money ain't the topic homie I ain't even talkin
Get it on by the workers but I'm cool with all the bosses
Catch me flossing at the mall, talking to a broad
She follow me to Gucci and I taught her how to ball
Chick said "dad that's more than my bag!"
Then get a group of chicks to give you head real fast
Silk scarf hangin outa jeans ya'll
Homie I ain't thinkin I'm just doing my thing
And make it rain on them broads watch the stacks fall
