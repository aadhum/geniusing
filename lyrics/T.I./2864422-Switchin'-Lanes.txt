What you oughta wanna do is get this money too with me
Even if you Bobby Seal, you gon' need a Huey P
Do you like it in them jeans dawg?
leave me out
they be on watch
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
So I'm talkin' Multi to the fullest
As long as I'm livin', fuck the ones
When I was young, they let me ride shot gun
And show me how to get it
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
