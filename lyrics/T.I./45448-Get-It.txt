Summer time balla when I buy the mall up
Long he ain't funny he got that long money
Naw money you niggas barely got hit the mall money
Ima Westside Bankhead nigga it ain't nothing
I was raised off Easy, 'Cube, Ice T, 8Ball, MJG, 'Face, Pimp C
I got the shit locked from Atlanta to New Orleans
Virginia Mississippi Kentucky I run all dat
boy grab a ball bat
Take it to ya skull,
Insist on having problems, bet dis revolver will solve dat
