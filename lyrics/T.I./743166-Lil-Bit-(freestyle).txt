Freaks in packs like Newport, true
The ho so hot, acting like she stupid
I sent her light dick, kid posse get to it
I told them all in the hallway listen
Pop some of this and you all gon' get it
You ain't fuck with a bitch, ain't my type
Let that hooker take your shine, snatch your flashlight (from me, ayy)
And that itty bitty Benz fit six friends
Drinking on Henn' out a big cup
Eye rolling like a fool to see you kick it in
I'mma tear they ass up
Bend 'em over on the balcony
Eyes wide open looking back at me
Ok it's 6:37, everybody all turned
See your groupie bitch with me, best believe they all learned how to
Don't be pulling on my belt cause then she holding up the pistol
