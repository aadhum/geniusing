[Pre-Hook: Young Thug]
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, peanut butter jelly
Peanut butter jelly, no deli
No new names unless you know they did it
Sleep in palace, watch it happen
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I don't give no damn bout no nigga
I don't give no fuck bout no nigga, I promise, I promise
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit
Run up that check, give a fuck bout that shit
I don't answer no questions, want speak with my lawyer
Tell your boss I said where my phone call, that's it
A lot of nigga shit, talkin' you don't ever get paid
Remember me, I've been bout it, dealin' out the 10th grade
Ridin' round in my homeboy Buick
With a tool in the unit
We'd go to school, eat lunch
Cut school, get back to it, nigga
If you can't go hard then you can't come here
Let me make somethin' clear
If you lookin' for a sucker well it ain't none here
Look we got artillery for days, we can spray from here
Hit your ass on the side of the face somewhere
On the side of the road, let you lay somewhere
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit
[Verse 2: Young Dro]
If I'm hungry, I eat 100 dollars then shit paper
Got the white double mint twin with me on Simpson
Twenty bricks in the regal
My whip? That's strawberry Yoplait
I got a chopper on the charger
I don't have a break, I'm keepin' bread
I'm gettin' fast like a track, mil I want that
Baby that cap's for the feds
That ain't your ho, don't tell all the secrets
I throw me some ones on these bitches
I stack them hundreds to the ceiling, they over there runnin'
I look like I came from nothin'
And I look like I came for somethin' and I'm comin', I want it
Yeah, I drink on that lean
And I smoke on that dope til I motherfuckin' vomit
[Verse 3: MPA Duke]
I got the bread
Ya'll bitch'll give me the head
Fuck her on the sofa, not the bed
Hit that lil bitch from the back
And I take out with your pack
And I'm not givin' it back
I done lost all my respect
Don't drink no red, we pour Act
Keep it goin' Energizer bunny, I'm so-so with these carrots
Her titties calcium, my booty calories
God damn we sandwiches
I do this shit for my momma
I'm not the Birdman but I'm stunnin'
I flip that bitch like a omelet
I've been with ya from the start
I did that shit from my heart
'm so so so sorry I hurt you
And I see the scar but you know I'm retarded
