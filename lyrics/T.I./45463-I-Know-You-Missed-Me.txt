I know you miss me, I know you miss me..
They say the city ain't the same and the nightlife died
Since T.I.'s inside, like the streets been quiet
The say the thugs ain't ballin and the dubs ain't fallin
Like the club been sorry, but I'm back now shawty, ay
Yeah, y'know I do it for the city and err'body that's in it
The generals and lieutenants salute how I represent it
Walkin off in the club, gettin err'body attention
When I'm out, record was spinnin, they start it from the beginning
Get bottles of Cris' n' Remy and pass it out to the women
Pull out a stack of twenty, throw it up to the ceilin
Watch it fall to the flo', start throwin some mo'
Ask anybody you know, wherever party you go
With me in the V.I.P., know that shit was outta control
Line stretched around the corner, shut the whole event down
Been a minute in the city since it really went down, ain't it?
I'm gettin calls err'y evening, sayin the streets need me
I'm at it just as soon as I'm able pimpin believe me
Niggas talkin greasy but they don't wanna see me
They know where to find me, soon as they release me
Remember me and Jeezy, at least once a week we
Hit the strip club, show these niggas how to treat figures
Hey, one stack, two stacks, three stacks, fo'
Nigga, five stacks, gon' tell 'em bring ten mo'
Lamborghinis'
Apollos'
they see me they screamin holla
The robbers follow the ballers,
Still ain't nobody hotter, I put that on my daughter
Atlanta you know I run it, err'body astonished
'Ey gotta stay in their houses like err'ybody were punished
wear my crown,
