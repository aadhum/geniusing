I wanna talk to you shawty
(Why?)
Cause you be trippin' sometimes
(Man I'm just trying stay true to what I say in my rhymes)
It ain't a doubt in my mind, but you got a lot on the line
You need to think 'bout yo' actions
Look at Cap and K.T. listen to K.P
Man but they be tryin' me shawty
Man you be listenin' too hard
Just pay these niggas no attention and keep fuckin' they broads
I know you harder than these niggas (Yeah) and smarter than these niggas (Yeah)
More heart than these niggas (Yeah)
Quit worryin' 'bout thses niggas
(Since you become a payed cat T.I. you been so layed back)
(I wonder where lil' bad ass Tip from back in the day at)
Man that nigga had to stay back there so we could be that
Nigga on TV
Be thinkin' 'bout standin' outside in the sunshine (Ho)
Watchin' nigga's heads get buck for cuttin' the lunchline
Mine got jobs, good credit and they own features
(And mine boost clothes, sell 'dro, got the blow cheap
(I'm really glad we had a chance to sit it down and rap a tad)
(I admit you had a couple points, sometimes I act a ass)
Ay but it is so important to keep it real though just like ya said
No record deal, no amount of mil' shall go to my head
(And with that said can't nobody tell us shit, so fuck the hatin')
How many niggas real enough to stand and give theyself a straightenin'?
