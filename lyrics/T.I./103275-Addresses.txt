[Hook]
Ay everything ain't what it seem
Ride dirty when I'm clean
Best check that disrespect unless you want it with the king
Put a address on that shit, who you talm 'bout? What you mean?
Wanna see me in the street, better bring some extra magazine
Ain't no back and forth my nigga fuck with me, I'm torchin' niggas
Don't go to war unless your money right
room full of money
Hundreds not a 1 in sight, right
Aye look I can't afford a gun fight, but I can afford a one life
You such a gangsta get some money out the street then
Been in in the game 11 years, if I was such a ho
Nigga I done been exposed 10 years ago
Never been robbed, never got my chain took
Never even been hit in my face, you don't believe look!
If people lookin' at me back when I was trigger happy
There wasn't no shoutin' matches I just got to gettin' at em'
I swear to God another day another fuck nigga
That's why I just get that paper and be like Fuck niggas
Hate to turn yo TV on every week and see my family hustle
And everbody in yo street just see your family struggle
What happened brah, guess your connect just be like fuck'em dog
No money when I see you I see none at all
That cheque I'm chasin' after never mind them hater rapper
Make they situation sticky like a now-and-later wrapper
Been fuckin' city's up, this shit ain't shit to us
Keep on, I show these folks on tape how you a sittin' duck
