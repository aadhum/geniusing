Aye, where the piano at shawty?
Ye-ye-ye-yeah
Y'all ain't never seen a dope boy play the piano and rap at the same time, have you?
I'mma show you somethin', dig this
I'm 22 and a vet in the game
I'm the answer to your prayers if you prayin' for change
When I'm, I'm climbin' the ladder, they stuck in the same mindframe
Except this rose gold glow from my wrist and my chain
T-I-P-I-M-P, I'm the man
Set the standard for Atlanta,
rearranged the lead
Tote gats
Seats way back in the Maybach I ride
Through the streets of the westside, I slap five
And throw dubs, show love, nigga
Hate me, why?
whus hattnin' Toomp?
P$C, Pimp Squad Click, shawty!
