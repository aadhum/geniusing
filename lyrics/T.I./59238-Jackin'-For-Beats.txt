I got some chevy's but a benz what I'm usually in
Shot a video in the pen and I'll do it again
Made news nationwide from eleven to ten
Headline CNN Peter Jennings and friends
When you was in the classroom try'na pick a career
I was sellin' glass, countin' cash, drinkin' a beer
Think of me as John Gotti wit' a PhD
Or either Martin Luther King with a G-18
O.G.s say a lot of them in me they see
Cause I'm a scholar no diploma no GED
You was on the low discussin' a g
When Urban Legend drop we'll see what the discussion'll be
