I ain't lookin for no trouble, I ain't duckin none either
Say a nigga jumpin ship I say so fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
Still greet 'em, with the same smile like I used to
End up head bust, bloody nose, loose tooth
Whoop a nigga ass by himself or with a group too
Who, fight back, ho it's like that
Where my knife at? Shawty I'll be right back
Today a 100 K ain't nothin to brag 'bout, ya hear me?
We gon' do it big like we did befo', fresh off a case
+ASAP+, +Motivation+ ho, guess that's all it take
They got they ass with my poker face
Wait 'til they get a load of me like The Joker say (ha ha ha ha ha ha)
Came back
throw your A's up
Black card, +No Limit+ like P and them
They say I can't have no pistol so I bought a bow and arrow
See ain't a damn thang change but my six pack
And when they holla King nigga they don't mean Elvis Presley
Leave a nigga drippin like a sippy cup, pick 'em up
