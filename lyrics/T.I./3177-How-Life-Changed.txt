antenna stickin up
We figure prison it just come with the life, along with losin your life
And there was no way we thought
We'd go to jail for e'ry case we caught
Didn't have a dollar in my pocket (in my pocket)
Now I'm watchin stocks like what's the options (options)
how life's changed
Numb to the fact that we was poisonin our own kind
I ain't give a fuck, he gettin his so I want mine
These streets are 9-to-5, you want it we can get it for ya
still we maintain
The same integrity we upheld in the street light
