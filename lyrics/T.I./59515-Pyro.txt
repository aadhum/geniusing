I got a corkscrew swag, they see me and get it popping
I wear their ass out and in the morning take ‘em shopping
Treat a ho so sweet, they get wit’ me, they spoilt rotten
They wanna be my baby, call me daddy -- no adoption
Training wheels on the hustle, I will never fall off
Treat me like the drummer, give me some would ya hun’
Yeah I’m hung but I still get sprung with the tongue
Fuck her good all night, even the sun finna come
I’m on fire and ice cold
Like loose women, and tight clothes
pyro
I’m the bomb bitch, I’m dynamite, pyro
Treat ‘em like Twix, keep'em coming in pairs
Debonair,
Money small thing to a giant, Eli
G4 flying, I don’t ever see the kiosk
I take a nigga little bitch and buy her a little Prius, yes
Take no shit, no how, no way
TNT C4
Party at the presidential, if you with it, lets get it
No matter where you live, I’m the hottest in your city
They talking ’bout they balling and their flossing but I live it
Black chicks, Latin bitches, Asian broads, white hoes
Black on black, credit card on deck
V.S.'s in the chain, filled wit’ clear stones
H.N.I.C.,
