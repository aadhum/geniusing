You are the [?],
I'm hot shit, flies
Now I finally realize the game's object
Swine dive off of my pedastal in the moshpit
Diamonds in my chain and bezel have me, frostbit
Shining right before the world, like you don't call shit
Cold with it, got juice like sorbet
Two a day, sold out, pockets bank, rolled out
I live in a big house, you live on a fold out
