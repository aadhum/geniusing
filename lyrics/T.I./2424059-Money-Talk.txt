Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
Lotta nigga talk, you don't ever get paid
All I know, get dough, keep it pimpin'
Taught me that in '85, never learned nothin' different
All I see is haters in my rear view
That way when you're talkin' I don't hear you, listen
Give a damn if you don't know
I've achieved everything you could hope for
If being a real nigga turned into a corporation
Look at me, shawty, I should be the logo
Focused on the money; fuck shit? forget about it
I bought a Lamborghini
I gotta run a bag up, it's extra for the blue one
Play a bit to the left, call it southpaw
Okay one day I retire, put me in the hall of fame
But you lames don't forget what I done taught ya'll
Then you gotta make a move, make a choice
Either go out like a bitch or get your ass kicked
God damn that'll be horrible
So pipe down, nigga
