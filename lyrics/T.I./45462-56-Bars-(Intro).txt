Aight Toomp man
Grand Hustle
Ay man, they been waitin on this shit since "What You Know" huh?
Yeahhhh, it's the king bitch!
One for the money, two for the show dawg
Know a picture's worth a million words I'mma show y'all
Death before dishonor
Without the braids I'm the closest thing to O-Dog
Hardly worth a hill of beans,
step up to the guillotine
Get decapitated
c'est la vie
but I'm illy though
King like Evelyn, Champagne mayne
Who? Andre 3K, B.I.G., Jay-Z, UGK
Scarface, Makaveli the great, Wayne, Common, Kanye and, Lupe
I'm why it's, hot as a bitch in here still, cool as a Frigidaire
This year I'm on a mission dear, think that was somethin, listen here
