Help on the way
Help on the way
They say the game in trouble
I got the game on lock
Standin on top
Say hello to the man who saved hip hop
Say hello to the man who saved hip hop
Say hello to the man who saved hip hop
They say the game fucked up
And the records ain't sellin
It was bad in 06' gettin worse in 07'
Market over saturated with all the bootleggin
When it seems better shawty ain't no tellin'
You hear my name so hot, I got the game on lock
You niggas keep floppin, But i remain on top
