I want my momma and daddy to meet her
Maybe have my name
You're my - super freak! super freak!
You're my - super freak!
Cause all my partnaz in the hood done tried you
Well listen shorty maybe I don't want a house wife
Juicy ass that them niggas in the south like
Keep it real, all the disrespect has got to go
