It's the King representin once more, ya understand?
When people see me on Bankhead..
Man the folks start pointin, screamin, and wavin, and yellin and...
I don't wanna roll over no toes in my Rolls, you dig what I'm sayin?
Y'all jump back up, let a pimp pass through, you dig?
The Beamers, Bentley's, double Maserati's
Every time I see you, shawty where ya headin tonight?
Sellin out arenas
chicks wit asses like Serena
Y'know, shawty goin extra hard when they release his passport
Why I need a credit card? What you thank this cash for?
Hit the dealership and give 'em every dime he ask for
Just so I can see two-hundred sixty on the dashboard
If shinin 'gainst the law, somebody better get the task force
For me, hoes love me, lemme fuck 'em 'til their ass hoarse
Pimpin' 101, just come and see me take a crash course
You wanna count my money, go to college, need a math course
On a mad dash for a hundred milli runnin
Breakneck speed 'til I see a billi comin
I'm filthy rich and hungry, feel the grumblin in my stomach
Put a couple pair of queens like I'm playin gin rummy
No cards, just broads when a nigga dick hard
Flooded offshore Audemars, lookin' like I caught a star
Swag on fully, no semi, ho, hand me
Bankrolls, no pennies, drop Rolls (roles), no Emmy's
You went to Bankhead, spot a drop head, I'm in it!
And bendin, a couple corners, hoppin on 20
Wit three or four women givin love like tennis
I'm about just where her chin is, giving me the business
While I'm ridin through the city, gag, swallow, no spittin
Livin life, like I just got out of prison Wednesday night
They keep my name up out dey mouth and mind dey business, dey aight
Hey aight, if you hear me say aight, okay, aight?
Cause you know I got dem goons with me and I pay aight
And they would like to see me broke or back to prison see me go
But instead they see me ballin, stuntin, everywhere we go - GO!
Money won't fold, pockets all swoll
Rubberband keep poppin off my bankroll
