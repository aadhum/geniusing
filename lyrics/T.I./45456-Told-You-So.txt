Grand Hustle
I been hustlin since 92' when I heard UGK
Hollering "Pocket Full of Stones" I was on my way
Had a history in the yay, before I started to trap
13, let me take you back farther than that
When my uncles was baggin blocks, used to count the stacks
I was only 8, and my grand-daddy can vouch for that
Puerto Rico at the mix show I'll let you know who the next in line
The Snowman, Paul Wall, and Thugga, now say I was lyin'
Cuz TIP was 20k
