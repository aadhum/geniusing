A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
Don't like, like, don't like, like
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah

Fake Trues that's that shit I don't like
Fake shoes, that's that shit I don't like
Fake niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Stalking ass bitch, shit I don't like

But I won't never snitch none in my life
I keep this shit 3hunna bitch, I'm going right
With my niggas when it's time to start taking lifes
Playing both sides, shit that I don't like
Wartime spark broad day, all night
Playing both sides, shit that I don't like
Wartime spark broad day, all night

[Verse 3: Lil Reese]
I'm killing these niggas shit that they don't like

Got your bitch, I was in it all night
Fredo in the cut, that's a scary sight
You not with the shits you can die tonight
I only want the top, I ain't tryna pipe
Them younguns with the shits they be toting pipe
Floating off at flat, I might take flight
3hunna bitch we hot, we done took flight
Taking shit down, we ain't like the price
Thirsty ass bitches shit that we don't like
OTFGBE yo bitch like
