Prison sentenced every year, got everybody after me
Still we're in the fast lane, grind break, next speed
A million dollar sports car, smoking on the best weed
Fist fights in night clubs for rap beefs
The bullshit, there be none around here
Hey, hey, hey baby
Could you learn (tell me could you learn?)
Could you learn to love a troubled man?
(I mean if you knew he was really
Really a good-hearted person, man
