I said the work that we was cooking wasn't dry yet
But he could have the residue from the Pyrex
But the niggas up the street was servin' touch and bust
He was with a nigga who wouldn't even buy an oz
That's when I said he's either robbing or the police
Whatever he is trying I ain't tripping cause we know where he stays
tool
With the Desert Eagle in my waistband
'bout twenty bands out of his pants
Shit that get you locked up, I don't sell blow."
Then he said "I heard you had it?"
I said "Yeah, so?"
I guess that nigga Boogie from a couple doors down saw his money
quarter mil, over twenty bricks
