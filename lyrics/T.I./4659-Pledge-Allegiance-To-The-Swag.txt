Ay count that money for me partner
Ay Ross make sure that nigga got that shit right, ya hear me?
Ay, let a motherfucker go ding, that’s a 150 thou
Yeah, that shit should add up to about 5.4
I be right back, I’m finna go get dressed
Tell tha nigga to gas up tha jet
If he get outta line his feelings finna get hurt
Hear that click clack roll, better get back fast
Have attention when you see me pledge allegiance to the swag
You don’t know me homie you can get the fuck from round here
Remy XO
bankrolled, swole up
Smell money in the air soon as I roll up
I’m the coolest in the city bitch
While you lame trippin’ on that goofy stupid silly shit
Brown bag of money, call me David Copperfield
A bitch’ll disappear, Lord, the bitch will disappear
We control the corners, that’s usual politics
Push a button from the mansion,
hit you with a hollow tip
We two different niggas, I’m servin’, he sniffing his
And I love that new Bugatti, how that bitch be shifting gears
Aviators and Audemars, tha bezel flourescent blue
our own
In the presence of a Don, pay respect, kiss my ring
End zone - off set, neck, wrist frostbit
Deal ain’t hundred mil, you ain’t talkin’ bout shit
On some Penthouse shit, rentin' out chicks
I smoke no more but when I did I was blowin’ ounces of gas
We down with whatever, don’t interrupt my countin’
Ballin’ on a daily basis, call my accountant
Only time you make it rain when you throwin’ change in a fountain
You come fuck with me on that bullsh-t you’ll be seeing Stars and Stripes
nigga, you understand that nigga, say I’m lying, think its a game if you want to partna
Nigga you could have died in the hand of another man, you know what I’m saying
Nigga I’m the best thing that ever happen to you, nigga
My worst muthf-cking mistake was the best you ever hope for
Know what I’m saying, I forgot more shit than you could remember
that Cage shit nigga
Jay say he made the Blueprint my nigga
This the muthaf-ckin’ Foundation nigga, ok?
Grand Hustle
