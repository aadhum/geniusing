Yo
Yeah, I'm on the way
Yeah, I had to pick up the new car
Aight
Aye, I'll be there in a minute
Aye, you dressed
My car’s orange, her toes too
Her eyes sayin' she want some
She on one, the stars out
Pulled up and opened the door
Whole in that new aventador
We parked somewhere down she layin' up front and I’m kissin' on her
Shawty look so good
She say she wanna do it in my ride
Look so good in my ride, she will do it in my ride
Shawty look so good
She say she wanna do it in my ride
Look so good in my ride, she will do it in my ride
So sexy, I just let her get it right on
Look so sexy in my ride, I just might buy her one
So sexy, I just let her get it right on
Look so sexy in my ride, I just might buy her one
