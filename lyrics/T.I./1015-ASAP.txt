Grand Hustle
Tip
(Asap asap asap...)
A nigga try to play me, I'mma blow him off the map
A-S-A-P
P.S.C.
I know a lot of rappers don't like me, but they won't fight me
Feds swear I sell dope, well why they won't indict me?
Advances on the throne
while I'm gone don't excite me
Normal population
Flip, say who known to the land and the people
My plan is to keep you at least 2, levels under me where I need you
I'mma take advantage of my chance to defeat you
Your true colors done shown, now it's on when I see you
v-suits
O.G.
you way outta line and you runnin' outta time
Hang behind closed do's when ya heard I got some time
