Don't learn a lesson out here flexin' they get bust in the streets
I told 'em chrome, Smith and Wesson right up under the seats
So I can sell a brick
In my opinion, bein' lame it should cost you your fame
In all the hatin' on my name burn it off wit' the flame
If I ride through the city on some D-L shit
You see me ridin' with a lean, with Big Kuntry King
I was raised by the greatest gangstas the city has seen
But I guarantee the P$C will be shootin' at you
