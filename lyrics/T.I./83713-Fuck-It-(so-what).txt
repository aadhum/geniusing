Still big bank can't fold it up
Hundred pounds of the loud can't roll enough
You approaching us you know what
You don't give a fuck about your life
Why should I so what
Ay what you know about me
Except you know that I'm on
And all the money I see
From all the places i've gone
Old G's call me O.G
And I'm a young nigga why do you think
Cause i've been putting that work
And I'm moving up in my rank
Seat belt on my AK
Nigga try me and it's mayday
Gon go down no plane crash
Inferno his lame ass
