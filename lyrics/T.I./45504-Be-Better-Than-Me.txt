I never know whether I'm living for tomorrow or dying for today
But either way I'm tryna move a hundred dimes in a day
They say that crime don't pay, but I'm gon' stay on the grind in the
A,
with the same ol' J's
I know the lames gon' say that I done changed, no way
I'm in the gutter everyday, tryna slang more ye'
In the middle of the trap, we hang the dro blaze
Niggas in the trap ain't changed in 4 days
Waiting on a page that saying the blow came
Instead of us just finding more ways to get paid
Anyway, in the fire, I done been there homie
Niggas ball, niggas die, and ain't shit fair homey
Shawty, the streets ain't the place to be
I'm telling you cuz it's to late fo me
Crack a slug nuttin betta to see then young niggas wit a felony sheet
I know ya mamma waitin faithfully on her baby to graduate ya see
You way betta than me
Betta than us, betta than this, take a chance nigga change some shit
You could be betta than me
When dez hatas speak yo name man burn dey tongue
Stay on the grind and yo digits'll come, bottom line
find somewhere to burry yo head
Because them hot ones from the choppas tear ya body to shreds
Not many trusts in this life either shine or die
Ima live one of two ways, either grind or cry
