As you see the O.G.s from Grand Hustle done laid it down again
T.I.P. shawty
this for all my homegirls like to see a baller do his thing
All the eight, nines, and dimes
I'd like to welcome y'all to the best time of ya life
Ya understand that
All the stones is real
And it's all chrome on the wheels, ya know
Anything less is uncivilized
Pull up to the club, lift both doors up
Hopped out clean and yo ho chose us
Cause my neck and my bracelet is so froze up
If you ain't gettin' money good night
Got a lot of rides, what it hurt to cop one more
Or roll on chrome wheels,
