This a trap
This ain't no album
This ain't no game
This a trap (trap muzik)
Welcome back to the trap
Niggas back in the trap
With another heavy Chevy
All you rap niggas roll out
I trap when it's cold out
But I stay down 'til I'm sold out
Cause down a hundred ground
Like a rapping in a dope house
Cook it 'til it bubbles
Double fast as a Mustang
But little showty tuff man
Since a nigga from Atlanta
Spit this much game
All they do is still niggas' ideas
And run wit' em
Holla somethin' similar
Talking bout the hood
Like they hung in 'em
I got a million rhythms
Want em come get em
What bitch you pussy nigga
I'm just havin fun wit em
Still telling niggas
I ain't holdin' I ain't foldin'
When the 12 hit the corner
I ain't rolling I ain't rolling
Keep the coke stretched out
Like Carl Lewis' hamstrings
Stepped on like I'm working
With the dance team
Triple beam ain't seen
What I do to a ounce of blow
The weight man on my pager
Like I pay you folks
To whip some more
I'm doper than the pure itself
I cook it all up by myself
I give my niggas recipes
So they can turn to chef theyself
They love to work
Thats why I keep 'em comin'
Like collection plates
We flip the cake
We move this shit from Georgia
Baby state to state
Intimidate niggas in the city
Who've been moving weight
Yo pockets losing weight
They fuck with us
Cause you've been known to hate
Demonstrate the way we turned the drought
Out in '98, started out in '95
Started out with nicks and dimes
Niggas you done lost your mind
Thinking you could set up shop
Pimpin' I respect the game
Lets take this to another block
Pimp squad
Showty still in the trap
When the spot'll be hot
With the mayonnaise jar
And the collared green pot
On a lot of straight Hen
And a lot of green pot
Competition in a rage
Like he gotta be stop
Oh what the blood clot
You try to knock 'em out of he socks
Listen to I'm Serious thinkin' how did he not
End up way up on the top of the chart
That's because where I was
Man you gotta be pop
And if you really want to pop
And I rather be dropped
Listen pops
Want to know a little more about rap?
First rule if it's real
It ain't just a record deal
It's a trap
