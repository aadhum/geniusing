(It's the King, homie)
I'm
Gone, momentarily, don't bury me yet
Like Ali got, I got the title back,
But when he need somethin back, nigga fade to black
Talk shit behind his back, you a hater for that
I don't expect nothin less, in the game of chess
You think five moves ahead and not behind
Niggas jumped up, cheered when I got my time
Like, "Yeah! One whole year I got the grind"
They say, outta sight's out of mind
But when it's lights out for ya and you locked down
Ain't no tellin whether or not your lady went and got down
Wit the nigga cross town, cause he hot now
Rippin up your love letters, liftin up her night gown
Right now, somebody baby momma gettin piped down
Kids in the next room listenin, "Momma pipe down!"
The thought hurt, don't it? But maybe she's strong enough
Or, ain't get that lonely, cause you wasn't gone long enough
it's a year and a day and countin
