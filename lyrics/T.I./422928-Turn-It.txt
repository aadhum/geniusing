I'mma turn it it for the dopeboys ridin' in the trap
50 pounds and that fire in their lap
I’mma turn it for the bad hoes, aye holla when you see me
Hustle Gang, nigga, that's mandatory
Still be trappin' out the 'bando
King pull strings like a Banjo
Get a nigga killed for a band, yo
I’m a Bankhead nigga, but the East ride for me
And that ten piece is like hot wings
If they disrespectin’ on top we kill ‘em
I'mma watch that, duck like like dark wing nigga
The money you get like crumbs to us
you ain't even thinkin' rich, I'm enough
Never will I be the one
Who ever go broke or don’t carry a gun
Play me for no joke, nigga, I’m not the one
New AK with a scope in case he may run
If I got my tripod I won’t have to try hard to kill him
I’mma catch me a case, I’m so ratchet
Got bad bitches in mad cities
I do a drive-by listening to Doe B
My knob bro' (broke), no remo' (remorse)
