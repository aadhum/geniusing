Will you accept my collect call?
Will you accept my collect call?
I was told way back in the day when I was trappin
Nevermind what niggas say, judge 'em all on they actions
Got a little Benja' pension, now they turn they back on me
I ain't never asked a nigga to do shit for me
I wouldn't do in return,
but guess you live and you learn
Don't expect my well bein to be a nigga concern
Cause I know that ain't the way the world turn
Cause niggas ain't shit, I believe that now
And it even matter how much you do for people
They'll love to see ya beat down livin in the gutta
butter soft seats
("Look at dat nigga!")
I remain a stand up guy no matter what
Stood tall, chest out, head up high
Wit my back against the wall, layin it all on the line
Wit God on my side I perform e'rytime
Similar to a miracle, just short of amazin
Survived shit that would've drove most niggas crazy
guns a-blazin
Theoretically speakin,
All I got is the family, friends come and go
And with that understandin, I put none befo'
My folk,
y'know enough to do the same I hope
If not...Shit, ya ass'll find out
When you on top e'rybody wanna ball wit ya
But when ya not you wouldn't even know who to call, would ya?
