Rebel for the hell of it,
Never have to sell a brick again,
Never been fucked in the game; I'm celibate
Rarely out my element
Five star general, O.G. veteran
Caked like Entenmann's,
Stack that cash like the U.S. Treasury
Put it on my pops, Big Phil, Aunt Beverly
Ain't got long hot songs, best cherish it
Cool when I drop mine; that's over, finito
Now, how could a nigga think that he could see me
Other than the magazine covers or the TV?
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
(BANKHEAD!)
House full of chicks on some Girl Next Door shit
Officially the hottest nigga rappin' since 2Pac
Wrist so frosty, neck so chilly
(BANKHEAD!)
Zone One, homie!
