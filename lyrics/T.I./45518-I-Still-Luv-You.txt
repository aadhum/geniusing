Forgave me once, forgave me twice, forgave me three times
I stayed lyin', you stayed down in the meantime
Eleven years ago I still regret me choosin' you
Meetin' you, pursuin' you and doin' you in '92
You fixed plates, showed yo face at every courtdate
And all you wanted me to do was call when I was out late
You think I sold yo dreams, but what I say I mean
ust take it to consideration, I was 17
I'm still the same man, just had a change of plan
Went from resentin' you, hatin' you, now I'm missin' you
On the realest shit I ever dropped, dissin' pops
I never even thought, to ask my mom what happened
Just knew that you was livin' in Manhattan and I was trappin'
We never had a chance, we was in different states
But all forgiven, you was human and we make mistakes
You tried to make it up, but shit, you couldn't pay enough
You sent me tons of toys and clothes thinkin' you gave enough
But it wasn't though, and you wasn't there
That's all I knew, so I grew up thinkin' you ain't care
I know it wasn't fair, but ay, it wasn't fun
But now what's done is done, no matter wha, I'm still yo son
I could care less if none of yo other children come
I'mma be right there prayin' you live to be a million one
Finally I understand, hustlin', livin' fast
Tryin' to get the cash and settle down and be a dad
You probably never knew, cuz hey, I never said it
But pops, I'm just like you, I'm stubborn and I'm hardheaded
But now you dead in the ground, no meanin' tellin' you now
But all I wanted was for you to be proud
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
If I ain't told you lately shawty
I still love you
Now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
I still love you
Don't hate me shawty
Please don't hate me shawty
Ay, I still love you
And now I only wish that I could
See that yo intentions were good
(Watch yo boy, shawty)
How could I criticize my daddy on that last verse
Lookin' at my own dirt, you got some nerve
But be that as it may, I got some shit to say
It's been a secret, I can't keep it for another day
I got a lil' girl, not just two lil' boys
And that's been killin' me inside, eatin' me alive
And I can't find the words, nor the nouns or verbs
To express whachu deserve,
girl you worth the world
But I'm a man and I ain't perfect, if you hear me now
I'll tell you wha had happened, when, why, where and how
Me and yo mama met, we kinda kicked it off
But we wasn't 'posed to have a baby, we just chillin' out
We had a lot in common, almost the same signs
Same goals, said thangs at the same time
But then we destroyed the situation like the a changed mind
How could I look her in her eyes and holla "Dat ain't mine"
Forgive me babygirl, I apologize
And I still love you
