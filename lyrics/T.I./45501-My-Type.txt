Y'all gon' wish for a nigga like me when I ain't here
Sons turn to grown men since they daddy been gone
Daughters grew
like him or not he left his family on
Even prepaid the funeral service he had in the dome
If they had only knew the man outside of the hype
No matter what the situation he always try to do right
They tried to knock him off balance when the Feds came and got him
Did the time on his head, came home, that ain't stop him
They just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin possum
