Black man, drop top
There go the cops
There go the cops
There go the cops
Is it because of my people?
Is it because of my sneakers?
Is it because of my jersey?
It is because that I'm perfect?
Ridin' down 85
I said I got a ID, I got glaucoma (I got ID)
He said, "We ain't in Cali nigga, get out, put your hands up"
Live from the cracks of the concrete
12 try to take a nigga off the street
Make the gun sound off for Mike Brown
Take a nigga life when you face down
Hoodie gang strong like Trayvon
Gun by the window like Detroit Red
Black man
Running from the law like Pac-Man
Try and throw the RAW all in the trash can
Got smoked by a cop on the dash cam
Mug shot on the news, he a mad man
When all he did was hustle to run the cash in
He feedin' kids in jail if he wasn't crackin'
All of my brothers turn to assassins
We seen too many brothers get put in caskets
Police see I got my hands up
Still wanna kill me, they don't understand us
Baton Rouge
Ferguson
Florida
Baltimore
you screw us economically, mentally
We say black lives matter, you say all lives
But y'all ain't the ones gettin' hogtied
Persecuted, executed, one day it gon' be time for retribution
Hope you don't ever see your son in an institution
It is because that I'm perfect?
