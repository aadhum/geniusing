Even stars (stars, stars...)
Ignant motherfucker please
You know exactly what a motherfucker need (need)
I need a bag 'bout a hundred fifty Gs
No broke shit in my life
Cause I'm scared that shit could rub off on me
I'm superstitious, no lie
Hate me till your stomach is all in a knot
Boy I'm already hot I'm already rich
They be still invitin' em  and calling it swag
None of them niggas you know
Fucking with me, you know it's all in the bag
I got a big cheque coming with the commas all on it
Audemar shine like some Armor All don't it
Fresh out of fucks giving in to my opponent
I'm a cold motherfucker man
Fuck a piece I want the whole motherfucking thing
Go tell the promoter hundred racks for an appearance
She sucking everybody dick and you all in the club with her
Like you all in love with her
Everybody know what's up with her
Ayy, run a hatchet like a flag pole
I've been getting it since Kermit the Frog was a tadpole
