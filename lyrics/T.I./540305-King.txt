You know, may no man, woman, child, nor animal
Walk a lifetime on God green Earth and not expect to be tested
Just observe and acknowledge when the occasion is risen to by champions
You know what I'm sayin'?
Let this speak for itself and handle me accordingly
When you see me nigga, it ain't no secret, you know what's happenin'
No fake, no flaw, man. Straight like that. It's the king, bitch
[Hook: Sample]
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em what)
I'm a king
but
?
Play around if you want and get hammered, leave you on your dick
I come from Atlanta, the '80s and '90s but we was as real as it gets
And that's why we still here
As I pray to the Lord, tell him if I should die tonight
First let me put up a mil'
Inside of the hands of one of the men
Who's gonna go kill or go to the pen
If ever should blood out my body may spill
The nigga, their partner, their family, they're killed
I'm talkin' for real, you kickin' that rah-rah to me
I LOL, shit's haha to me
Got a Maybach, it's just like a Mazda to him
Geesh
The capo, capisce?
Got the streets on a leash
The way that I walk it, exactly the way that I talk it
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em what homie)
I'm a king
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down (tell em doug)
I'm a king
You say she wifey, I say she a party girl
Type to eat bitches out when she on molly
You'll never know, which is to me that shit's obvious
no body, no case
And most of the niggas you see standin' by me today
Were trappin' with me in the A
You lay it down, lay it down, you lay it down
I'm a king
