[Intro x4]
Miya hee, miya ho, miya hu, miya ha-ha
Ay... this a special what's happenin to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Safe to say I paved the way for you cats to get paid today
yay'
It ain't that black and white, it has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway, even if I left today and stayed away
You steady chasin that paper
Ain't got no time for no haters
spirit of a hustler
impartial to the politics
Could do without the fame,
Until the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gon' post up on the top spot
In the Windmill City got my whole team with me
