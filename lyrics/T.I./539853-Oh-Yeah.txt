I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal
I stand next to God, to man I'm no equal
Ain't no breaking me down, bitch I'm breaking the banks
Got the heart of a lion, and I'm as strong as a tank
Sittin' on my throne and my crown, can't separate me from that
Who the people want
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
I stay silent with red even if I'm standing with blue
They may be killers to you, hey they my family dude
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
Bet you never been to war like I ain't never been to college
Said you coded took a plea, he ain't tell but you woulda
Suicide, you should commit it, save a G a life sentence
When they see you, they might judge you
Give you side eyes, they don't trust you
Misunderstand you, call you trouble
I understand you, it's just a hustle
Just keep stirin' it, let it bubble
You're my brother, I'm not above you
