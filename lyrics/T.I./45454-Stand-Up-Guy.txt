Ey, I know you done kicked it with a lot of niggas before
But you ain't never kicked it with a nigga like me
Hey Hey
I see ya baby, throw ya hands up high
If you wanna come and kick it with a stand up guy
Bend it over let it drop if you wanna roll wit me
Like that fella in the yellow Purple Label silk sweater
The stones keep glowin' on my wrist like whoa
And she can't stop lookin' I know ya bitch like those
And she chose, ain't no question if the bitch might blow
Just get her to the crib and get her whole back sore
I'mma blow my dro', I'mma pop my pill
Ask anybody wanna take a shot, I will
Might see me in a different color drop, Hot Wheel
With the top down low, and the Glock concealed
I got the Hayabusa racing up the block,
one mil
If the police try to chase me you know they a done deal
We'll send this .45 be up in yo chest
If you got a man and you're tired of being there
You done gave him too many chances, you're tired of being fair
I offer you the opportunity to ride with a playa
You, me, and a couple of freaks in the ride with a playa
I know God see the heart, and I'm a stand up nigga
You really getting money? Throw a grand up nigga
Let the Smith and Wesson hammer body slam fuck niggas
