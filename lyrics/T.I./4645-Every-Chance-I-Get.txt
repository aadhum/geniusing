Hey I'm so raw, and I'm so rich
And you so flawed niggas ain't 'bout shit
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm gon' ball every chance I get
Every chance I get, real talk, no shit
Every chance I get, make money on this
I'll take yo' broad, I can fuck yo' bitch
Know that I'm gon' ball every chance I get, every chance I get
They say it's lonely at the top, but I don't feel lonely
Got my homies out in Hollywood so I don't feel phony
I'm King like my 3 year-old, Major like my youngest son
Got one named Domani, so you know what I'm gettin (guap
Got an angel named Leah here to keep me outta prison
And my partner Jason Geter to help me see about a billion
My records sell about a million, but shit that just the beginnin
Club Crucial
Plus "A King of Oneself," high fashion, I'm flashin
I gotta thank my lucky stars cause it came so far
Dope game, rap game, 'bout the same so far
Brag about your lil' Benz, nigga that ain't no car
I got some shit in my garage that requires a chauffeur
P$C partna, Pimp Squad Click
Yeahhhhhh, they say I ain't Zone One, bitch nigga
My grandmama been livin on Center Hill 43 years, ho-ass nigga
