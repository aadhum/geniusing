[Intro]
Bankroll Mafia, Hustle Gang ova everythang nigga
Dodging nothin' but a Fed case
And ain't no turnin' round lookin' back
I'ma, Bankhead nigga to the heart
In Lenox mall give a damn
We demonstrate and leave your brains on the fuckin' wall
I ain’t neva been shot at, and I ain't shot back
And still got stacks from back from “What You Know About That?”
You caught slippin' roll down on your ass, .45 start spittin'
Goin' be a long day nigga I start trippin'
I’m just a project nigga on the front steps
And gettin’ money is the concept
By any means, and the belt where the gun kept
I let that whole clip ride, til ain’t one left in it
Try me, I'ma handle my business, handle my business
Try me, I'ma handle my business
Try me I'ma handle my business, try me
Yea, I’m a daddy, love my little girls
But I’ll still check a bitch like ‘Pac did Lauryn Hill
Hey I ain’t grow into it, I was born with it
Used to sell crack to the children of the corn
