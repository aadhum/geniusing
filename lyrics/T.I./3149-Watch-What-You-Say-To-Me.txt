look up the city, police is lookin at me
You swear these niggas is dangerous, the gangsta shit they be saying
Lock em up in the booth with a half ounce of that cannabis
Sit back, and watch the outlandish shit they portraying
But, soon as you see em they freeze up like in museums
Them statues, you like, "Is that the dude, that said he was gonna... (pmmm!)"
And then they back to riffing, when they off at the safe distance
You like, you was just here, you disappear like magicians
In thin air, I'm like damn, nigga at least keep it consistent
And put you all in ya place like I'm replacing ya father
