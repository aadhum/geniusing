Our mamas passing, by trying to explain us
Pissing in the bushes like they never house trained us
But, try to understand thats how we came up
You get to know us, you'll love us but you can't change us (naw)
Really we rather be rich and famous
But in the mean time were forced to slang dust
'Dro or crack cocaine, Penicillin to Rogaine
Ecstacy, Viagra, whatever'll get the dough mayne
I'm tired of people misrepresenting my domain
Oh you think we out here killing for nothing, hustling
For no gain (picture that)
[Hook] (sample playing in the background)
I don't know if you don't know, don't care or can't see
Every time something up in the hood, it ain't me
And I ain't always up to no good and on the creep
So you ain't always gotta pass through the hood without speaking (how you doin'?)
We ain't out here threatening your lives, raping your children
We just out here staying alive, making a million (you know)
Working hard, trying to survive chasing a mill-ion
just think of us as chameleons
Adapting to situations,
But our options are few, it's hell in high school
When your helping with the rent lights and the gas bill too
When you're under 25, staying alive's hard work
If you could think about somebody besides yourself
Why you pointing fingers at me, analyze yourself
Quit all that chastising and try to provide some help
Cutting school to sell fifty dimes by dinner time
See everything we know we learned from the streets
Since thirteen I've been hustling and earning my keep
