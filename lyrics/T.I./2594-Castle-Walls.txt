[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again
Your vision jaded by the Grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Walk in my nines a while I dare you, would it scare you
Because the camera doesn't see beyond the walls of the smiles
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls
Me knowing this, why should the verses I have laid
Be more important to me than the persons I have raised
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls
Living in this castle made of stone
They say that money is freedom, but I feel trapped inside it all
On top of the world it's beautiful
But there's no place to fall
Disregarded the king of the south raised doubt
[Hook: Christina Aguilera]
Everyone thinks that I have it all
But it's so empty living behind these castle walls
These castle walls
If I should tumble if I should fall
Would any one hear me screaming behind these castle walls
There's no-one here at all, behind these castle walls
