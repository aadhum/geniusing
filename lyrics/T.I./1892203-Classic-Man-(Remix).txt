[Verse 1: Jidenna]
My name calling all night
I can pull the wool while I'm being polite
Like, darling calling all night
I can be a bull while I'm being polite
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
I know many women want to be in my life
Like, oh me, oh me oh my
Why can't every woman end up being my wife?

[Pre-Hook: Jidenna]
Even if she go away, even if she go away
Even if she go away, even if she go away

[Hook: Jidenna]
I'm a Classic Man
You can be mean when you look this clean
I'm a Classic Man
Calling on me like a young OG
I'm a Classic Man
Your needs get met by the street, elegant old fashioned man
Yeah baby I'm a Classic Man
[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jidenna]
I burn through the hood like whoa
When everybody's feeling so cold
I'm cool like Nat King Cole
And niggas get a bit of my glow
I got charm like a leprechaun, mummafucka
Now y'all fucking with the wrong mummafucka
Treat me like a don, mummafucka
And we don't live by the law, mummafucka

[Pre Hook+Hook]
