Why you blushing?
Wit such a pretty face, big booty, little waist line
Have a great time, pour yourself a shot girl
Chase it with a lime, now you feeling like a hot girl
[Hook]
We're sittin here
(I'm lookin at you like damn)
We're sippin on Patrãn,
something's on my mind
(You wanna leave wit me tonight?)
It's been Killing me all night long and I wonder
(Listen shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
Oh girl, I wonder
(For real, shawty let me tell you what I'm thinkin bout)
It's the end of the night
I thinkin your might, wanna leave the bar
Park the car, turn into porn star
See your panties through your dress like a silhouette
A little more of this will loosen you up
You can blame it on the Patrãn or the champagne
But sometimes being bad can be a good thing, ya now
