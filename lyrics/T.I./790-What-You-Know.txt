Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
I got key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
See me in your city, sittin' pretty know I'm shinin dog
Ridin' with a couple Latin broads and a China doll
And you know how we ball
Riding in shiny cars
Walk in designer malls
Buy everything we saw
You know about me dog
Don't talk about me dog
And if you doubt me dog
You better out me dog
I'm throwed off slightly bro
Don't wanna fight me bro
I'm fast as lightning bro
You better use your Nike's bro
Your bitch most likely does
dubs

Gave every ho a hug
Niggas don't show me mugs

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
I got key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
Candy on the six four
Leather guts and fish bowl
Fifty on my pinky ring just to make my fist glow
Your bitches get low
Because I get dough
So what I'm rich ho
I'll still pull a kick do'
scary
Believed by very few
Just keep it very cool
Or we will bury you
See all that attitude's, unnecessary dude
You never carry tools
not even square, he cube
You got these people fooled, who see me on the tube
Whatever try the crew, they'll see you on the news
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that?
What you know about that?

I got key by the three
When I chirp shawty chirp back
Louie knapsack where I'm holding all the work at
Loaded .44 on the low where the cheese at?
Fresh out the jet to the 'jects where the G's at
Fresh off the jet to the block
Burning rubber with the top popped
My partners busting shots,
I'll tell them "stop, it make the block hot"
Yo label got got
Cuz you are not hot
I got the top spot
And it will not stop
A video or not
bust it 'til the Glock stop
Drag you out that Bentley Coupe and take it to the chop shop
Although we not y'all
If it may pop off
I'll answer the question "Will I get your block knocked off?"
Look I will kill bro
I'm in your hood if you a gangsta what you hid for
Somebody better get bro before he get sent for
You say you wanna squash it what you still talking shit for
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
What you know about that?
