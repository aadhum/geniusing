Do you wanna see a G
Do you wanna see a G
Do you really wanna see a G in pain
Like a moth to a flame, Imma [?]
You're like a lighter to the sun
Your little fire won't survive in an inferno
Them bitches got you thinkin' you too tough to get me what I want tho
[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you
I don't need you, but I want you
(T.I.) You can have it all, but the pride come before the fall
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to
I don't mean to, but I love you
(T.I) It's how you want it, it seem different than you thought
[Verse 2: Jhene Aiko]
Tell me whatcha say now, tell me whatcha say
You said that you would come again
You said that we would remain friends but
You know that I do not depend on
Nothing or no one
So why would you show up, so uninvited
Then, Just change my mind like that
[Bridge]
Please don't take this personal
But you ain't shit
And you weren't special
Til I made you so
You better act like you know
That Iv'e been through worse than you
I just can't keep runnin' way
[Verse 3: Jhene Aiko]
Everybody's like, he's no item
Please don't like him
He don't wife em
He one nights em
I never listen, no
I should have figured though
All that shit you was spittin', so unoriginal
But it was you, so I was with it
And tell you the truth, wish we never did it
Cause I usually do stick to the business
But you came out the blue and then you just flipped it
God damn baby, my mind's blown
I be forgettin' you live in a different time zone
I think I know what this is
It's just the time's wrong
And yea I know what you did
But baby I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
If this is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just
Say my pride is just, well maybe Imma just
Go spend 4 mil on a crib, not a jet
All the kids wanna where they lil brother's at
Goddamn, I didn't even tell my mother yet
But if all else fails, hold my G code
Take it to social media to try me
Putting folk all in our BI all on IG
Nah, I don't believe it, I don't wanna see it
Maybe I wake up tomorrow it'll be deleted
You out the country in bikinis on beaches
While I'm in the studio doing features
[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
In the Way
Funny how everything changed
(T.I) Ain't it funny, ain't it, ain't it, ain't funny
Once you got all that you wanted
(T.I) Yeah, you got it all now, huh
Nothing was ever the same
(T.I.) Just like you wanted, it's all yours, fly away, go
