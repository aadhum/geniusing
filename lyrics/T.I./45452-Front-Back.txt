[Sample: Eazy-E]
Back, front back, fron-front back, fron-fron-front back, side, side
[Intro: T.I. + Mannie Fresh]
Ladies and gentlemen!
T.I.P., aye!
Fre-fre-fre-fresh!
I know a lot of y'all niggas out there, man, who ain't up on this down south shit
Probably wondering what the fuck you listening to right now, ahah!
King amongst kings!
But it's an absolute honor and a pleasure, you know what I'm sayin'?
To bring you some gangsta shit of catastrophic proportions
Yeah!
Hey, Bun! Pimp C, nigga!
I gotta '66 Impala so fresh
White top, burnt drop wit' the choppers on deck
and a motor out a ninety-four 'Vette
I got the checker red leather and I'm sittin on chrome
On 26 inches just to get my roll on
One of Jeezy's songs on
like Dr. Dre six four
Dedicated to the slab (slab), the dunks (dunks), the drops (drops)
Keep it trill, this the south baby, Texas and GA
Now pop ya trunk, get it crunk, it's time to ride
[Verse 3: Pimp C]
keep a swisher full of pine (pine)
But I don't really wanna hit ya with this hot thang
I just wanna get some brain in the turnin lane
Comin down creepin slow, sippin on a Colt fo'
