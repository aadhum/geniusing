The King's been the one representing all of Atlanta's zones
Back when niggas was representing Atlanta wrong
Every shot he got, he put the hoods of Atlanta on
ya songs OK, but I'm on fire
I came, I saw, I conquered with no big names
No fame, no celebrity sponsors
I'm 24 today, give to I'm 28
I'll be ruler of all that I survey and not just in the state
