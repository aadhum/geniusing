You see him standing on the furniture doing his thing
Tell the club owner: "fuck yo’ couch!" Rick James nigga
Pop a bottle, make that thing go bloaw
Let her drink it till she drown
Atta girl gon’ wild, pop a bottle
Bow, bow, bow…
No subtraction, only cash to divide
We getting money, bank roll, super-sized
Whether rain, sleet, sunny
Let the good times roll and the bottles keep coming
The tag team back bitch, boom shakalaka
Me and Weezy run this shit so bring me one soda and vodka
And a Fiji for my nigga cause the police probably watching
Man, probation is a bitch but going back is not an option
We be sonning all these niggas, put their ass up for adoption
Man we start with straight shots, that get the bottle popping
We be working all night, telethon shit
Roll a super skinny one, Chanel Iman shit
Oooh, that's that fire, that have you calm shit
You with a lot of dudes, that’s that Elton John shit
I like a bad bitch from a decent home
Me and Tip, that's that pimping that we preaching on
I know the sucker wish the judge threw the book at me
Cause I show up to the club, super cool, look at me
Everything brand new, you get money like who?
Bought every bottle at the bar
Shortie you know how I do
I take them all across your noggin', I ain't finna argue
Still big shit popping, nothing changed but my clothes
Triple digits in my pocket, rubber band bank roll
Tell the bitch I take you places where your man can’t go
Can’t be, he ain't doing shit, if he ain't me
Can't you see the difference between us when I walking to the door
Your twenty thousand worth of ones, start letting money go
Let it fly, throw some twenty when my one running low
50 stack, I’m a show you how to ball: triple that
