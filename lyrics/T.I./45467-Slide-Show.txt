When I think about all my time and all my struggle
Through all my grinding and all my troubles
Man I came up from nothing, all I had was a hustle
With a blindfold trying to find pieces to the puzzle no muzzle
That impossible is nothing your environments irrelavant
Just don't let your emotions overpower your intelligence
Refuse to give up, your mistakes don't define you
They don't dictate where your headed they remind you
The Time keep ticking let your mind keep clicking
Never stop thinking be aware of your positions
Be aware of the collisions and the potholes sitting
On the road that you travel on your life long mission
Beginning on Bankhead then it spread out
Vision in my head all I had to was get it out
I ain't really have a role model to infleunce me
Uncle Quinn in prison they say next it's going be you in it
Maybe I'da been Kanye instead of seeing Gunplay
