Ay shawty man a I got 5 for 45 shawty, 5 for 45
Well shit what you need shawty
Ay these these bd's right here shawty
Ay this that this that noyd too shawty
The quarter go for 5 and the half go for 9
Still in the trapp wit them break down dimes
Hit me on the hipper anytime, I don't mind
Why y'all niggas bitching on and whining I'm a grind
Shack it in the winter and the summer I'm a shine (getting mine)
It's plenty of money to be made from
Candler Road to Bankhead
It's plenty of room to get paid for those that ain't scared
I got the hard for the j's and dro' for the dank heads
Da dope boyz in the trapp nigga
The thug nigga, drug dealer where you at nigga
I say the, da dope boyz in the trapp nigga
The thug nigga, drug dealer where you at, a where you at nigga
Never everybody in the swats know I got the fiyah fiyah
Nigga want that weight got it for the high high
I get it and I cook and it's gone for it dry
Get a quarter ki and cut it down to all dimes
Buy my own blow so the profits all mine
C got choppers on his vert and I got daden's on mine
Triple gold and vogues, poppin' moe' blowin' pine
Honey brown wood grain wheel in the 'lac
Oak on the dash and the 12's in the back
Nann nigga barred we the trillest niggas living
Boyd homes
350k what I paid for the shit
Made 850 quick when I flipped all these bricks
Getting rich in this bitch
