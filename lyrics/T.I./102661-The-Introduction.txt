[Intro]
I come apart baby, but now I'm fine
I'm checkin' trouble sugar, moving down the line
I come apart baby, but that's ok cuz
Trouble man, don't get in my way
I'm just a hood nigga I ain't never had shit
Just a bad attitude and a bad bitch
30, 40, 50 grand in the mattress
Living on the edge just a habit dawg
I'm fucked up in the head I don't have it all
Ball like a dog push it to the limit
'Bout my business tryna keep from letting pussy niggas in it
My priorities is follow, God first then the fam'
Then the hustle, then the money, failure ain't in the plan
Satan on my heel he don't want me to advance
I tell him go to hell sucka catch me if you can
Shit I am who I am, fresh up out of apologies
Sometimes I ain't get in trouble, trouble got in me
Guess it follows me but I stays on my hustle man
[Hook x2]
Trouble man, always in trouble man
Grand hustle man, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Trouble Man, stays in some trouble man
Bank rolls, rubber band, you can call me (Trouble Man)
Just left the crossroads, my soul, unsold
Raw ho, caviar, sushi and escargot
Everywhere I go fresh to death and clean as a bar of soap
God knows I'm hot as El Diablo
Wrist rockier than Colorado walk road
My art's so Leonardo Da Vinci, Picasso
The rain gone come down on your head like tarp holes
King home
bank roll on King Kong
Prayin' for my downfall you can dream on
Make sure I'm back in the Maybach gettin
Don't be angry now if I'm on the same street
Make a u-turn haven't you learned I'm, Trouble Man
Weight on my shoulders, chose to squat with it
Real niggas say I kick it the same way Pac did it
Upset cuz they can't do they thang like he did here
Shit, another year another bid done
Them nigga lookin' for some drama I'm a give 'em some
No more beef a pimp will say goodbye to red meat
But cross a nigga path and you're dead meat
'97 college basshead, 99 dime
'98 have provisions on 285 flyin
Skip where you meet KP and L.A Reid got signed
