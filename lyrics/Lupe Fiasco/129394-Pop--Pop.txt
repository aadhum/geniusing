Ya'll dont wanna see them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
You know i dont pop pop at the bar
But i might send pop pops through your car
Ya'll dont want them pop pops when this on
Cause if niggas get them pop pops
Then they gone
Got the police the hustlers and the gangstas nervous
And all these little rappers on basic service
I'm knowin
I ain't the hottest nigga out
Got that fire though
You gone have to put your hottest nigga out
And i ain't talkin bout when the partys over
I'm a moltov cocktail bicardi thrower
Size ten aligator skin mari loafers
