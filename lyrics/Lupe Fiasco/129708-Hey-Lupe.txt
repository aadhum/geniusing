Give him a float
Then give him the floor
Its what I shimmy down ur chimneys for
Ur pennies from the penthouse
Im fifty twenties from the twentieth floor
They waitin on the downfall
Of a g, like ground floor
Grindin like ground beef til me and the ground meet
For takin sumthin so basic and makin it uppity
So publicly so what if he hold something so stubbornly
So grudgingly up in here for something that he does so lovingly
Now its finna get so ugly, so utterly unpretty
Its like im next in line, theres no cuttin me
You know, where bad chicks sit
Keep a nine around my waist, like ninja back seat
I mean I heat pack, like injured athlete
So as long as I'm right here and as long as there's nike airs
We gon' get it on as long as light years
Or as long as light's here, right here
You will last as long as a nice pair of white airs with slight care
In other words your career as long as dyke hair
Keep it right here, y'all ball fades
I'm all braids with white hair
All man from a cold land like white bears
