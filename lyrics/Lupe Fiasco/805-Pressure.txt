1st AND!!
And so it seems that I'm sewing jeans
And 1st and 15th is just a sewing machine
So I cut the pattern and I sew its seams
button in this hustling
publicly I'm Buddy Lee
There's no busting them
cuffing them
Ushering in the regime
they want me to make Prince pants
A little big in the waist
two-pocket on the back
Call them Lu-vi's, old jeans covered in blue dye
Give 'em the game, that's like giving chocolate to the fat
That's the same game that came through where I lived as a kid
In the bad luck truck and threw boxes off the back
slicker
they said oil and water don't mix
Now they all down at the beach washing off the fish
Was Blackbeard til I brought the Roc into your ships
everything I say you know it's the truth
Cause it sag so low you can see boxer
That's the way that the Family's pants worn
Don't be sly and try and put 'em on
The stones in the pocket'll drag you down to Davy Jones' locker
Beware if you wanna rock the Knickerbocker
Other nigga from the block what, they was selling O's
Like Wheel of Fortune, of imported cocaine
Just to feel important,
it was "Do or Die"
They was tired of being "Po' Pimps,"
That was just a product of my common sense
I was just guessing like the consonants
Momma said beware of what the devil do
Tell 'em that your soul's not for sale like the W's
So go ahead and pirate, the highest
Cannons make you leak like pirated my shh
It's no shh.. it's just shh like quiet
And big homie's out of retirement
everything I say you know it's the truth
Young
the pen is mightier than the sword my lord
My first picture was a line-up
now I'm on the Forbes
And I still remain the artiste through thees
If you force my hand I'll be forced to "draw"
If the war calls for Warhols
Hope you got enough space on your hall's walls
I make niggas murals
then escape the bureau's
Investigation
out in Europe on vacation
I'm back for these
puppies
the pound
(Blaow) Here's a round boy (blaow blaow) down boy
Sound boy, you don't wanna soundclash loud noise
Leave niggas paranoid if not paralyzed
Which means you can't walk in my shoes
Too much green you can't talk in my hue
Extend the team, nigga holla at Lu'
1st and 15th, that's my cue, I'm through
everything I say you know it's the truth
