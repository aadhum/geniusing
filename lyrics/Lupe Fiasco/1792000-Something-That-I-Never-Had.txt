I just wanted something that I never had
Sins of the father fall on the fins of the father swimmer
Then my son is going to Jannah
[?]
I bought this doll from a priestess
If you been feeling awfully nauseous said recent that's the reason bitch, gone
Over here by the mirror was little man making pictures
Hitting his firetruck with one of his action figures
The bird that he once seen is now move closer to the edges
He pursues it but his balance starts to lose it
Luckily he landed in the back of his daddy's Benz
But he was on his way to go and cheat again
