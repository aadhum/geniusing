Uh, yeah, one time for the drama
Halcyon vibes got me feelin' like a llama
Life's a beach but no Bahamas
I just wanna wear pajamas
Whole life I been fightin' on piranhas
With katanas inside of my hand
I just wanna lay down, play sounds for the coolout
And, fall asleep on the pool couch
And, wake up to the new wave
And, take a break from the schoolhouse
Underground styles, shoulda came out of Stone's Throw
