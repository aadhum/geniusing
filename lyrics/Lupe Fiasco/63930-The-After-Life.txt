Kissimmee saint cloud condos
Malik el-Shabazz
Those that choose not to dodge us
Bullet lodges
Like water buffalo better get
Hustler ettiquette
Move rocks like Frederick
Like Max Julien how I Macks julie 'em
So I'm forced to keep a gun up in the drawers and a, vest tight like a woman wit some balls
They wanna take me off the wicker throne that I sit upon
Like Huey Newton
Transmittin, these ghetto laws like the transitions
I move it to death
Like my hands spittin, from my lungs to my tounge to my gums to the guns
Extra heavy coppin, set up every block and buy out every bag of plastic wrap saran rippin
