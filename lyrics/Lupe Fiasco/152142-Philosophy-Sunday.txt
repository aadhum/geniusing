A Marxist theory today:
Actual Revolution which affects wholesale societal change is only seen via technological advancement i.e. industrial
it suggests a negation of ideals as truly transformative and that true force behind changes across the board in society is technology
[TW] @LupeFiasco but doesn't it take an human idea to create a technological advancement?
[TW] @LupeFiasco French Revolution Lu? As far as I know not any significant technological advances. Else you can educate me #ps
[LP] It can be argued that French Revolution was a failure. And not really a revolution at all. More Iike a civil war @epl82
[TW] @LupeFiasco Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps
[LP] “@DHoltThe1st: Marx's theories indirectly killed millions of people, so I don't generally trust any of them #ps”
Jesus's as well to argue
[LP] Yes Muhammad too and Buddah as well...
[TW] ah, so you're thinkin of revolution in the sense of a widescale change of thought and the ways we interact and see one another
[TW] @LupeFiasco ever read The Book of Daniel by Doctorow? Says revolution is a circle: overthrow power take the power but do the same as former
[TW] @LupeFiasco Foucault: "resistance is never in a position of exteriority in relation to power." Technology moves ideology via accessibility.
