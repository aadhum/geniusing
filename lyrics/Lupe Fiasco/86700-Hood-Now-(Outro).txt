This one for the hooooood!
What do you do when it's so unequal?
Wear Michael Jordan’s with your tuxedos
It’s hood now
It’s hood now
Yea, yea
It’s “hood” now
Public school system only teaching parts
So the school of hard knocks is what make you street smart
You’re hood now
Hood now
Yea, yea
Hood now
Open fire hydrant 'front the liquor store
Kool and perm ads all on the billboards
Ramen noodle soups, you make the best
Water in the milk to make it stretch
Ivy League was running really well then
They slipped up and let Cornel in
In Miami Beach, it’s rich white folks
But Memorial Day, you-know-who do the most
And house shoes is for the house fool
The homies wear 'em out, how cool
And that Mercedes Benz, on them giant rims
Open up the trunk and see 'bout twenty 10s
And diamond chains was for kings and queens
But since we got to 'em they'll never be the same
They hood now
They hood now
Bling, Bling
It’s hood now
You pissed her off, you broke the rules
Her earrings out, she taking off her shoes
It’s hood now
It’s hood now
It’s about to be...
Really hood now
Chop up Jazz, loop up the Rock
Sample the Blues, call it Hip-Hop
We took that hurt, made it into songs
God bless the child that's got his own
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Pants saggin', right off my ass
I sit it down, right in first class
Fancy restaurant, dress code
T-shirt, gym shoes
Hallelujah
It’s hood now
Fashion shows, with fancy clothes
You see Mr. West right in the front row
At the Oscars, P on the sticks
And the winner is… Three-6
You had Elvis Presley and he was crackin'
But guess what? Here comes Michael Jackson
Pro sports, them was yo' courts
But you let us in, so on and so forth
They gave us scraps, some of it old
We cooked it up and called it “soul”
And you know me, I don't vote
But the White House, you already know
It’s hood now
It’s hood now
Yes sir
It’s hood now
You know I had to do it
Can’t forget where you came from
One for the ghetto
Two for the hood
Three for the all
Four for the good
And we out
This the great
I mean
God is Great
American Rap
Food & Liquor 2, through
