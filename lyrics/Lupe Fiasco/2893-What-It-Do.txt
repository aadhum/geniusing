Believe me like you saw me on TV
My name is Lu, somethin' new
I show you what it does (what it does)
How it is (how it is)
And what it do (what it, do)
I saw it on TV, I was told to buy a CD
The CD told me buy a TV
The TV that I bought came with a CD that said go and buy the DVD
The DVD that I bought came with a CD
Which was the DVD of the makin' of the TV, that I saw
Which told me to go and buy the CD in the first place,
wait nah
I put the DVD in the TV so you can see what I saw
But wait, it's a CD so you can't see me, odd
Maybe I should just come out on DVD like CB, far
With mad special effects and maybe
a CG, car
To ride around in on your TV
Bumpin' the CD that I got when I copped the TV
Which is the same TV in my car
My DVD is gonna come with a CD, too
CB
You see when I bought the TV I spent the money for the microphone and
The home recorders too
And the foam that you need for your crew (crew)
That blocks out the noise when your voice's recording you (you)
Tell 'em to be quiet 'til the voice recording through (through)
Garage band file then export to iTunes
CG car
They can't do what they see me do
But I'm the dude that's easy/Eazy too
Like I'm Eazy Juniorrrrrr
Homie this is food for thought
Better put it on your fork like GD Hooverrrrrrrr-ah
Now that's two TV's that's in my car
That’s not really real man that's really a fraud
It’s from the green screen
My CD might not pump on your block
But at the truck stop man I'm really a star
Same music homeboys hollin' in the background (yo!)
See I had to lay the smack down
Act like a X addict
Act now gateway off to the next habitat (habitat)
Couldn’t match it now I'm laying that down like a mat now (ooh!)
And checkin’ for me, now they pat down like a Howard Gap found
We took from other things you ain't finding in the stew
That’s why's no booth and I'm rhymin' in the Lou, still buying the CD
That’s why I catch 'em rhymin' in to me while they rhymin' in they room
Now I'm off to Caloon for some rhymin' and some tea
My pinky up on my tea cup
If you play the DVD at the same time that you start the CD
You gon' see that they sync up
And if you happen to doubt, just play the CD while you watch the TV
And you gon' see that I'm doing what I'm rappin' about
