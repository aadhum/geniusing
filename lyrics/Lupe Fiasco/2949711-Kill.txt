We're like satellites for strippers
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
We got dollar bills to kill
I'ma turn it up, you burn it up (ayy)
Turn it up, you burn it up (ayy)
I turn it up, you burn 'em up (ayy)
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
187, make that mothafucka pop
5, 10, 20s, I'ma throw it
Work your way up to them big face hunnids
These other hoes been workin' all week
You gettin' more than that just off me, yeah, yeah, yeah
We both work hard for this money (yeah)
I see you goin' hard for me
It ain't no thing, you can take it off (take it off)
If I keep on drinkin', I'ma lose it all
Astronauts and alcohol
We're like satellites for strippers
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
We comin' to the stage next, you know who this is
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
187, make that mothafucka pop
My nigga, if these poles could talk
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
We're like satellites for strippers
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
187, make that mothafucka pop
[Verse 3: Victoria Monet]
'Cause I work hard for what I get
Just so I can give my ten percent
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
I'm talkin' 187, make that mothafucka pop
187, make that mothafucka pop
[Outro: Lupe Fiasco & Victoria Monet]
'Round and 'round we know
It's like dollar bills to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
Need a dollar bill to save
Make it rain on that collection plate
And your dollar bills can save
Make it rain on that collection plate
You made it clap, now take it back (pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (pray)
You made it clap, now take it back (whoo)
