They go forever back, to the days of Butkus
And Nitschke was simply on this planet just to run blitz
The 182nd clash of titans, do the math
They're bitter rivals for 10 short of a century
Put the season on it but Jennings steadily beats
The best of the DB's to get him his TD's
12 on the year like his quarterback wears
And why would you insist on tryin to split, Brian and Briggs
A Superbowl ring is bein repo'd
