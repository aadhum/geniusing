[Hook: Gemini]
He don’t care, he gon’ put the freeze on the charm
See through them frames with the C’s on the arm
South beach, light breeze through the palms
Two or three dames,
With, wrist watch, crown on the face
Big Glock, pound on the waist and
I’m the focal point at play
When I come through all the old folks will point and say
