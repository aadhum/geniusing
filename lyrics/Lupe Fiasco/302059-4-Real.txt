My heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust
Err'Day in the street my heat too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Forreal, not only holding we bust

I'm a pimped out nigga that walk with canes
Talk with slang, who ball from New York to Spain
Wanna see me in hell like breathin' in
With nines to blow my mind like Eve and Gwen
They always wanna rub you off when you lamping but...
It's the young capital, L-U from the Avenue
This the nigga that, push lambs in brook-land
Party with thieves
keep geneves at inner in the sleeve
And cook grams, you wanna see me oxed up, propped up
Judge cotched up over my cases
still pimpin', hustlin' in the same
Clothes like the Simpsons,
