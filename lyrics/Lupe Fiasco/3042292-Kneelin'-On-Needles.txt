Wa-ves... you say waves, I say wa-ves
Kaepernick, waddup?
I knew they was gonna do that to you
But it's all good, though
You gotta' stand up for something, know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, uh
Gravitons
Orbit around my halo space, halo space
Stay your place, play your bass
Writer, fiber optics on high fiber
Move
Quick like that, no, I go as, "Ain't shit like that"
Magnum entendre, rollin' on a rubber
Hit Virgin for the album, I was floatin' on the cover
I pit my car, they let a lad in
I was floatin' on the cover,
made a message out a mess
Got 'em clothes up the flow and taught 'em how to dress
Made a space so they can milk this way
Had 'em open up the udders
Cartier frames, Aoki on a shirt
And red and white chukkas
NASCAR star got bars by the carload
You know LF won to come out the top
But for this ten, I'ma just open up the car door
If I break it down to your lil' homie, might get a nigga CARTO
You ain't gotta worry 'bout ours though
DROGAS Light, DROGAS
And I might drop SKULLS as an art show
K-dot wants stretch marks
I wanna own everything that's west of the best parts
K.R.I.T., everything from the legs down
Mickey Factz, everything where the neck starts
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply then turn around and drive all the price up
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white
You would think that Kaep
Took a shat on the Statue of Liberty
Fuck, be more like Chance
BDs and GDs be more like fam
Women lie, men lie
And everybody lie about the numbers
I know I’m weird but nigga it’s real
Better to hear it from a nigga like Lu
Before you hear it from a nigga like Trump
Talking to a nigga like you
And the fuzz came through to indict us
But it's an inside job to decrease the supply then turn around and drive all the price up
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white
But it's hard to believe that people still believe that Jesus is white
