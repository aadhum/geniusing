I gave you honesty on my first joint
And y'all all came out
Unroll your blunts, pour your champagne out
(Dullers of the pain) so you can plainly see
The black man pain I campaign 'bout
God willing 'fore I wane, I take a champion route
Before I throw a bout: I'll walk out the game
While my fans in the stands is chanting my name out, Lupe
And it's going to be PPV, won't be back for free
Gone need scratch to see me rematch with me
My greatest enemy, is my inner me
So I take this urge and give you Revenge of the Nerd: Fahrenheit 1-15
Box so I can shop, sometime it doesn't register
So I return to the ring, like Return of the King
With the habit of a hobbit it makes it hard to drop it
I'm a klepto stealing
Just when I guess that I left those leanings
I be back on post in a trench coat scheming
[Hook]
With a shirt full of pants
And my accomplice got a purse full of pants
A pocket full of purses, with no intent to purchase in the plans
And we rehearsed it till it's perfect, just to dodge the searchers of the man
Just to surface outside
then return of all the merch to stay
In the service of the perfect understand
And I boost myself
So from the coal car to the caboose I'm felt
From the rear to the engineer
From the L to the Underground Railroad
From the redline to the TGV
A champion fighter for whom the bell tolls, L-U-P
Little engine from the hood
Known to hit the track like John Henry
My eight ounce Everlastes'
And a Michael Buffer entry
Shoplifter, tag switcher
