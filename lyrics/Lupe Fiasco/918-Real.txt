Yeah, my man said he wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something he could recognize, something he could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Baby girl said she was in the mood for something real
Real, real, real, real (FNF)
Something that could make her move
Something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel
Lust
Sometimes can override trust
She said that's why she gave it up
My man said blood spilled out of everything he touched
He crushed everything
He crushed,
ruined everything he loved
He just wanted the rush
Blamed it on the times being rough
Doing dirt with the devil, chasing after the dust
Make a fuss if it's them
But we hush if it's us
That's why, my momma said she wanted something real
Real, real, real, real
Something she could be proud of, something she could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
She said they so used to not having nothing real
Real, real, real, real
That they don't know how to act
They don't know how to feel
Feel, feel, feel
Life
Ain't meant to come around twice
Yeah, that's why I gotta get it right
They said I got it honest now I gotta give it light
But sleep on it, that's why God give you night
I mean, I had a dream that God gave me flight
Too fly for my own good, so God gave me plight
If I wake up in the morning now I gotta give 'em sight
Make 'em see, break 'em free
Ain't a G, show you right
and Sarah Green
The game is not to give 'em nothing real
Real, real, real, real
Nothing they could use, nothing that they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
Give 'em a bunch of lies and teach 'em that it's real
Real, real, real, real
So that's all that they know
That's all that they feel
Feel, feel, feel
Struggle
Another sign that God love you
Cause on the low
Bein po' make you humble
Keep they names in my rhymes
To try and keep them out of trouble
Cause bein po' also teach you how to hustle
All they want is some shoes
Or some rims for they bubble
Now that I got my own, I can hit them with a couple
Cuff my homies so they ain't got no reason to cuff you
That's my plan, if I can
On the man up above you
and Sarah Green
That's why, I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something they could recognize, something they could feel
Feel, feel, feel, feel
To my homies on the block I gotta give 'em something real
Real, real, real, real
Something that'll make 'em stop
Something they can feel
Feel, feel, feel
and Sarah Green
Yo! FNF are real, really real, yeah
