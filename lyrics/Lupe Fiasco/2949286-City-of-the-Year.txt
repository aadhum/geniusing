Ayy, born in the middle of the West
Lil' nigga, livin' in the middle of death
Raised 'round killers, that's why little impress
but I think you the best
You don't need no Khaled
Let me push my brother, we don't need no malice
Fourteen with a AK, and he'll let a nigga have it (raaah)
Fireworks in K-Town, man it's so tragic
Fireworks on the lake front, shit look like Magic
City of the year, city of the year
That's where I'm from
Go hard or go home
I'm turnt up in the 'Go zone
My city look pretty in the summer
6th grade, moved out to the hundreds
Prolly wouldn't have made it hangin' 'round my mama's
Harvey World where I made my come-up
Bishop was a BD, Dope claimed Lord
Cliqued all up, put it all on CD
Neutron don, but I prolly been a GD
Puttin' truth in all these rhymes
State tried to shut a nigga down
Gave my nigga Chilly all that time
People think it came out of nowhere
It's all by design
They took away the chiefs
And the streets lost their minds
In the 'Go zone, in the 'Go zone
I'm from Chiraq
I'm so high, you in a ditch
I'ma get mine, Money Makin' Mitch
