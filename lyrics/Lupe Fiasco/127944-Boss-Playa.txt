F'n'F up all day (all day)
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your Tecs. Check it
I'm really gnarly
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys
I will leave hardly, life of the party
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave
Don't make me catch a body
[Silenced gun shots, body hitting the floor]
F'n'F up all day (all day)
Young pro is on the cut always (always)
If you represent your set when you're rolling through the jets
Take your fingers off your triggers keep your hands of your techs. Check it
I'm really gnarly
Really harder than tryna wheely Harleys
I will leave hardly, life of the party
Hotter than Saudis in furs in the Mojave
Don't make me catch a body
First and Fifteenth probably
Playa don't trip when the clique's in the party
You trip, then it kick, like Mr. Miyagi
I brought an extra clip in event of a robbery
You flinch then it click like Clint, Dirty Harry
Don't think that my money gettin' spent on Ferraris
This game that was told is old as Ataris
You sold into slavery
The system I pimps
I limps like a Charley
Horse.
Bring the chorus!
Homie you can't leave like that
When you bleed like that
You won't be right back
Ain't it boss, playa?
What, you think we freeze right up
When you breeze right up?
Don't you bleed like us?
Ain't it boss, playa?
Playa hatin' won't stop
If it's getting too hot
Better go'on out the galley
I'm a top cat, homes
Got a phone in the alley
And I locks that down
When I zone, understand me
And I drop rap poems
Like domes on the Caddy
Like cops when you clock that
Brougham goin' over the speed limit
You spot that
Somethin's been thrown like bones
And you combin' for baggies
And you see it's weed in his seat
Me an' my man G
Had a home in the valley
And I just left New York
And I'm goin' back to Cali
Laughin' cuz dro in my system
Plus I'm havin' a ball
Man the game ain't the same since the 'caine done stopped
DEA's done slowed up the game 'round near Brainerd Park
