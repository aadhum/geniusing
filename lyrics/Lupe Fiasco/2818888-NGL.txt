Niggas wanna win
These niggas wanna win
These niggas wanna win
Everybody wanna be a mothafuckin' winner
That ain't how it work though, yeah
Ayy, ayy, disproportionate convictions
Especially when it come to our case (our case)
You seen the movie, they killed the nigga
Why you still wanna be like Scarface? (Scarface)
And you can have a friend and you can have a Benz
One's sittin' down, the other's traffickin' (traffickin')
And she want love, you only want sex
You got yours, she didn't get hers (get hers)
She got no respect, y'all had a son (oh)
She like, "Fuck you," she only want a check
That lil' nigga gon' lose
Yeah and these rap niggas talkin' 'bout the hood
Like we all lames and they seen it (seen it)
It's entertainin', it's cool as hell
That beat dope, that don't mean shit (mean shit)
That's why niggas gon' lose (niggas gon' lose, woah)
If they legalize that whole thing
They doin' weed, next cocaine (cocaine)
Niggas ain't gon' have no jobs
And Wall Street gon' run the dope game (woah)
What a nigga gon' do? Huh? (niggas gon' do, oh yeah)
You niggas gon' lose (niggas gon' lose, woah)
And when you see me you don't see yourself
That's why I got no problem shootin' me
Willie Lynch set the shit up beautifully
One of the reasons niggas ain't got unity
And you did it 'cause your daddy did it (and you did it 'cause your daddy did it)
But he locked up in there and ain't happy with it (oh yeah)
Do the same thing, get the same results
If your brain work then what's the matter with it? (lose)
I never met a saint, from no color (from no color)
From nowhere, from no other (from no other)
From no castle, from no gutter (no gutter)
It ain't nobody that don't suffer (it ain't nobody that don't suffer)
Some niggas gon' lose (niggas gon' lose, oh)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (some niggas gon' lose, aw)
Promised land, I don't believe that
Had a dream and I don't need that  (need that)
Please God, send us some jobs
'Cause my niggas really really need that (my niggas really really need that)
Or niggas gon' lose (or niggas gon' lose)
That's right, niggas gon' lose, yeah (niggas gon' lose, oh)
And we sell dope then we turn around
And give the white people all our profits
Take a percentage of that, set it to the side
And send these lil' niggas off to college
So niggas don't lose (yeah)
And if they offer somethin', just take it
Then work hard, don't waste it (waste it)
Every castle started at the basement (basement)
Yeah, your manager a racist (racist)
But you're the one that's gon' lose (you're the one that's gon' lose, lose)
Ayy, you wake up 'cause you hear shots
Mean another nigga got his tear drops
And you call his phone and ain't pickin' up
And your stomach hurtin', that fear drops
I hope a nigga ain't lose
