My sneakers more cleaner than yours more meaner more cleaner
Than yours
my car go faster 85 an hour I'm
About to take them backwards
Yea now that's back to the esscence the freshest
Prince that's in your presence the uniform on backwards
The f and f eleven it's a laster went from a thrower to a crasher
(ooh) now while that's flowing right past ya let me take a second
To add up all the factors
a-trak on the track and lupe is the rapper
I'm much flyer united I'm N.A.S.A, I'm much higher not a puffer
I'm a passer
Tag her like I'm a graffer or
I grind should be on the cover of Thrasher
