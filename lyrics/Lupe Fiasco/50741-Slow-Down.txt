But we was
(diggin' the scene with a gangsta lean)
diamond in the back)
We had no

Bingo, no higher, them tires, that bentley on 20's is spiffy, it's done by 310 altering
I wanna get one just like it and customize it and ride it

Western California, Kedzie when I'm traveling
That's like a watch a wrist so that we can tell time on both arms
Thank God for this gift I got that I have
We went from Aldi's bags and boxes up to Dominics
