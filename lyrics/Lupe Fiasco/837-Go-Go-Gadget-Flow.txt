Credit for the ghetto, ghetto images
From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
That I'm holding
I got my go, go, go, go, - go, go, go, go, gadget flow

Love, got the windy city on my back
So I'm back on my grizzle like a bearskin rug
Plus I'm laying on the floor
blame it on the Go
I'm surrious with the words with the man up above
Thank you very much
That I got what I got
and I'm at where I'm at like an a in a circle
With a pay little Urkel
From the F to the F to the amazing verbals
They race in circles like they racing a gerbil
I race in a circle like I'm racing a horse
I'm racing a Porsche while they racing in place
Course, that case in the court did not defer the dream
I am still a raisin in the sun, raging against the machine
From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
That I'm holding
I got my go, go, go, go, - go, go, go, go, gadget flow

I let my momma in the rhyming that she raised me off
A 80s baby on fire like a safety off
Got my hood riding high on them 28s
Trying to get Above the Rim
A little too short to dunk
So we donk
From the M-A-D-I to the S to the O-N
Potent, to get you open
Move like a nigga supposed to
Get your dough on the go with the flow
