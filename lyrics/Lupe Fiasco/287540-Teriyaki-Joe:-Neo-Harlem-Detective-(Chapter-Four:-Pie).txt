hmmmph!...aaah!...*Gulp* :)
"Happy Valentines Day Baby" she says with a wink. I fell for the Mohawk. She fell for the 10,000 Units. The business of love in the streets
"Everybody" just for 1 person. Seems a bit extreme.
You'd think all that Taichi would make them a little more peaceful
A little more humane. Hell even a little more robotic would be nice at least they have a valid point.
Serious as the 100 Million Units he winked at me when I refused to take the job

Serious when he said in 5 days he'd "update" every food pill in Neo-Harlem so instead of the shakes you got the deads right after dinner. ;)

Get rich and save Neo-Harlem. I like that.  Getting lost in the VooDoo and probably end up destroying Neo-Harlem anyway. I don't like that
Things tend to get real possible when you got a gun to your head or money in your hands. I got both. Mix fear with reward. I'm impressed
Getting a human soul back from the afterlife is lets say a little more complicated than that. Not pie at all. Devils pie is what it is
Shit!
