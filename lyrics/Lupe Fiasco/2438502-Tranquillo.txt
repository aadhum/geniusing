Peace
no material possessions shall cloud my judgement
As I reach, in an ethereal direction to provide my substance
Love is not found but resides insides me, I manifest this
I will respect myself and wear serenity as my necklace
I will replace what I take and have tranquility as my breakfast
Shed a new light on a new path
I will gain rhythm and lose wrath
attain wisdom and refuse graft
And build upon what I built on
and wisely regulate time I do have
'Cause what is defeat? But just the evidence of my haste
Lack of preparedness, in my waste, so I wait
Surround myself with nutrition, wholesomeness and true livin'
Use natural codes of conduct to remove schism when the rules missin'
I will pursue felicity, find value in simplicity
Altruism and empathy will be the first thing extended to my enemy
Clarity will be the trademark of my friendships
Just invest in my business and appreciative of the rarity of my existence
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Young nigga say, ball
'Cause he ain't really livin' life 'less he's down to roll the dice
Put it all on the line for a couple dollars
And a bad bitch that only think about him if he, call
Is it really worth the time and the effort?
Chasin' wood grain and the leather
don't wan
You don't need a handout, they gon' bring the bands out
Choppas make 'em stand down, good Lord
But you don't wanna be another nigga
Chasin' figures that never really add up
White folk pass your face
Dyin' in the grass 'cause they wouldn't call the, law
'Cause you're hooded, black and they think you're sellin' crack
Maybe so, you don't give a fuck in a rut, nigga
'Til those in the street got you stuck, nigga, what, nigga?
Buck, buck, nigga
Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga, go be reborn
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout them drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout that love
For myself and all my niggas
All my bitches and all my thugs, what's up?
'Cause I got chillin' by the million, tranquillo by the kilo
Nigga, nigga, what, and I got kilos by the speedboat
And I ain't talkin' 'bout that work
I'm talkin' 'bout that worth
Of myself and all my niggas
Every diamond came out the dirt, nigga
