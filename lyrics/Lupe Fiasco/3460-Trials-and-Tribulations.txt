Through all the trials and the tribulations
And the storms
Yeah
We're still here
They couldn't believe how I took jargon
Made it describe how I push hard in
Through the streets,
and at the same time I was pushing the margins
So far to the left that I ended up writing on my desk
Yes, I'm from a concrete jungle, that'll make your set look like bush gardens
It started won't stop, who don't
Want us to blow like bomb squad well fire on guard
It's Lupe touche
Coup de Gr√¢ce
now put them in the trunk like the roofs are our cars
Yeah, rappers is like Sonny
When I'm up in the booths with my bars
Fresh from the mayonnaise jar
Prepared to bring you down reach your razor blade's pause
But it wasn't easy to crack it, we wasn't fly
Had to get it off the ground pedaling
E.T. was in the basket,
now it's sick
1st and 5th bought to come up like the last bullet in the clip
Click, a few didn't survive
It triggered something inside
gave me power,
got a grip
Like the floor of the shower
I set my sights on, no lights on
Silence is my 5th plead the 5th
I don't need a Japanese flag, Vash the Stampede of hip-hop
straight from the hip
Cocksuckers pull backwards
I pull faster it's master
I haven't turned into guns like MegaTron
they won't follow ya if your points is hollow
Explain all their rules and roots
But not enough to incriminate
Just enough to demonstrate
Why they're confused as youths
Are easily amused and and consumed with hoops
Bodily accused and refused the truth
Followers, easily subdued by flukes
Swallowers, of anything the bandwagon hands them
Well listen to me, telling them to listen to me
Take you to my home, please remove your boots
Not the spook who sat by the door
