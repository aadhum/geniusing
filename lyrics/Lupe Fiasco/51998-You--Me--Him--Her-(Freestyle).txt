over any Proteus drum pattern M-P
While you smacks her down I tap her gently
The game I runs like a lapper indeed
Y'all kids ain't cuttin the di-jon
I pull up to ya car like Grey Poupon
if I bring the danger shake it fast
truck... full of holes like Jason's mask
No Mystikal
Elevators ain't lettin' you up, I'm a big boy (Big Boi) everybody in love wit Lu, she you and your cousin too
Just Cadillac doors and outta mack 4's, old folks turnin' cataracts toward him
I'm so hard to see and so hard to be, hey, can you handle traction, push an Abraham Lincoln or an Andrew Jackson
They don't like the words but they'll honor the magazine, I'm the Source of the shit
Forty-four in my Jockey draws I'm the horse of this shit but my money never short
Niggas there's no eatin' here nigga don't put ya money into forks
Niggas its a cold cold world don't put your money in shorts niggas
