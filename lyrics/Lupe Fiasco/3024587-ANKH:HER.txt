[Verse 1]
A drunken ground for my niggas
But what if up was down for the liquor?
Then pour in somethin' stiffer
Might just milk a tub out my hand vein
Ivy league, I receive, Irie vibes
What a dream! What I mean? Idealize
A statue wouldn't mourn 'em, so I wake up to erect, damn
And the bed made of women
Who came first with a head made of chickens?
Break the fast, break the mask on a egg-makin' mission
With X-rated visions
And the glass
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys
May I die from a hand that is not black
Lie down my crown where Mike Brown dropped at
At the spot where he was unchained
To pour liquor on it and watch a King grow from the blood stains
Then hug him, I'm just here, I ain't here to judge him
I hear the jeers, the cheers, I'm adjusted
(Ankh:hers)
Pterodactyls, there are damsels, in their fingers
Ambulance chasers, bad chance, ain't no mash for the bangers
Bottom made of glass
I'm on the wrath with the danglers, shakin' my shaft
You just bass to the anglers (hooked)
Drift to mausoleum, shackle my feet in 1919
Hollerin' droppin' cosmopolitans on the crime scene
Xenophobian, hemoglobin soakin' on white queens
Pale-face invaders to foreign devils and gaijin
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys
Clear the vision with the spit inside the aviators
Legit but quit because the lick promised them pits of paper
Will we eliminate the innovators?
Will we commemorate the imitators?
You are now set trippin' with eliminators
Life givin' persimmons
So now your lemons persimmon flavored
Why you mixin' different neighbors? Spike it
Now the wrists are slittin' razors
Drunken box thieves fightin' bars to charge a dead mine
Iron wing Icarus, dip a bit, fly a Siamese chicken strips
Well-designed to keep from liftin' shit
Feather me or let it be
(My nigga, what's up?)
Tether me or sever me
(My nigga, what's up?)
Definitely won’t set me free
(My nigga, what's up?)
No, she look like a set of keys
