Now if you never left Houston get a passport
Never left Little Haiti get a passport
If you live in South Central get a passport
So you can see the world
Yeah, and if you rep the five boroughs get a passport
Or if you're in the Dirty South get a passport
If you're on the Westside get a passport
So you can see the world
Now I've been known to levitate
Like a hobo tryna catch a freight
To get away, and clear the day
Then I'll be smilin' at the stars like the hood does cars
bullet
Mathematically aligned like the pyramids or Pharaohs
Let's start a coalition so even the broke can go
Sharper than the prong or the Neptune's trident
I'm just ramblin' - I ride my bike in the clouds
Mr. Spielberg, hire me at Amblin
(To the nigga Pimp C) God bless your life
(And the creators of the syrup) I hope you're restin' right
Because you screwed a lot of lives, kids and wives
In my mind I'm goin' "woo-hoo" just like The Hives
But in my mind, compromise my design
Like a missin' puzzle piece,
make completion hard to find
Hours resuscitated by Capri Sun juice packs
Woke up singin' N.E.R.D. songs and you can YouTube that
Now stay away from people that pursuit they lack
My new passport has been issued so I'm ready
Trekkin the Sahara or grazin the Serengeti
Let's go to sleep in Paris, wake up in Tokyo
Have a dream in New Orleans, fall in love in Chicago
Mayne, then we can land in the motherland
Camel back across the desert sands
Then take a train, to Rome, or home
Brazil, for real
Wherever I go she goes
Yeah, I'd done seen Paris, and woke up in Tokyo
But I'mma always be Sarah Green from the Southside of Chicago
Just because you on Section 8 and he left
It don't mean a thing ("Girl I can't go nowhere")
Oversees, even over here I over seer
Like I'm tryna stop these slaves from gettin freer
From the truth I never veer see, so, faithfully I steer
As I ride through yo' city like Revere, revered
Now everybody gon' and put yo' hands in the air
All you haters with yo' hands in yo' ears - it's okay
Cause later, it will
sneak up on you like it's Metal Gear
Put you in a chokehold and then unconsciously you'll cheer
Remain upper tier, ain't no cryin down here
Only shed is in the back, yard with the tools in it
So crude
Rasulullah
I know you sick of all the rat-tat-tat-tat
Well this the soothin sounds from the backpack rat pack
Seein Sarah Green from the FNF crew
Two from the Child Rebel
and the Q
When I be home I resist it like it's Ohms
Shalom!
Yeah, and if you rep the Midwest get a passport
If you from Detroit get a passport
If you from Chi-Town get a passport
So you can see the world
Get that little black girl, a passport
Get that little black boy, a passport
If you ain't got one, get yourself a passport
So you can see the world, yeah!
