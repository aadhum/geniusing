Always solo, no no, I live like a hobo
Work for billions, maybe millions, not a trillion
Maybe like a trillionaire, have you seein' things that aren't really there
Like my homie thought drug dealing, Kick, Push, how so?
The royal penis is clean your highness
Shout to GDs, shout to BDs and MC and Mickey Cobras
We need the peace treaty for the summer
Free Rondo! By him a condo, shout out to Lil Durk
OTF Nunu rest in peace
Put the guns down like Chance say
shout out to my boy Ty Dolla
Everything look better with a bitch next to it
That's the next single, nigga, watch 'em play the music
