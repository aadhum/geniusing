[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?
[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco ]
She said to him
"I want you to be a father
He's your little boy and you don't even bother
Like 'brother' without the R
And he's starting to harbor
Cool on food for thought
But for you he's a starver
Starting to use red markers on his work
His teacher say they know he's much smarter
But he's hurt
Used to hand his homework in first
Like he was the classroom starter"
Burst to tears, let him know she's serious
"Now he's fighting in class
Got a note last week that say he might not pass
Ask me if his daddy was sick of us
Cause you ain't never pick him up
You see what his problem is?
He don't know where his poppa is
No positive male role model
To play football and build railroad models
It's making a hole; you've been digging it
Cause you ain't been kicking it
Since he was old enough to hold bottles
Wasn't supposed to get introduced to that
He don't deserve to get used to that
Now I ain't asking you for money or to come back to me
Some days it ain't sunny but it ain't so hard
Just breaks my heart
When I try to provide and he say 'Mommy, that ain't your job'
To be a man, I try to make him understand
That I'm his number one fan
But it's like you booing from the stands
You know the world is out to get him, so why don't you give him a chance?"
[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?
[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Burst to tears
'That ain't your job
[Hook: Gemini & Sarah Green x2]
I can't, I won't, I can't, I won't
Let you leave
I don't know what you want
You won't want from me?
