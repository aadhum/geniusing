Well I know I'm not the coolest
And this might sound kind of foolish
Cause I know I'm not the smoothest
Told myself I shouldn't do this
Cause I'm not very well-suited
Not the popularist of students
We ain't in the same crowd
Always see you with the hoopers
But we got the same lunch
You might see me with the cooler
That's cause I don't eat pork
You can never be sure of
Oh you like Linkin Park
That's the hat from the tour
I got an autographed shirt they wrote, much love 2 ya
Man that's really funny how we like the same music
But I really love jazz
I was gonna play the tuba
I tried to join the band they said I was really really bad
Didn't really make me sad
I'm used to being the loser
But you, I think you're super
So much, I had to pursue ya
I don't believe the things they say or the football teams rumors
The quarterback can't spell
I'm his after-school tutor
I just took a cue from Cupid but
Now I think it's stupid
Thinkin' that she would never talk to me
Like what were you thinking
Bringing up the band
Would have got a better result
If would have just beat her up and ran
You shouldn't have worn your glasses
Take your shirt up out your pants
See now it's all over
And you won't get another chance
Damn, I was so close to her
She said I know your not the coolest but I swear you are the cutest
And I know you played the tuba
I seen you at the recital
It takes a lot to get up there and embarrass yourself
But you shouldn't put down you should merit yourself
That just mean you not a punk
I like "Thelonious Monk"
He's the wallpaper on my computer
I love Final Fantasy
I hate first person shooters (me too)
"Meteora" was nice
But I bought "Hybrid Theory" twice
Half of the cheerleading squad is in the stupor
The only reason I do it is cause my mother took state when she was a junior
And she want me to do the same so I'm like naw
I wanna be an oncologist and diagnose tumors
I gotta a pet parrot his name is mister tuna
My favorite food is fish
Remember that for the future
My IM name is missluna you can hit me after six
How you feelin' right now
Yes yes yes yes yes yes
Come Seymour we have things to do!
You know today gonna be the coolest
And you know how far your school is
Know how dangerous the flu is
So button up your coat
And finish off your breakfast
Food is to human
As buoyancy's to boat
Pop, last night I was lookin over the futures
Commodities is felon, rental properties is sellin
The bio tech market share is at its hugest
Lucas Dear, why is your bookbag full of tulips
