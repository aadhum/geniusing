Let me tell you what this fellow like
Caught somewhere between stop and go like yellow lights
Down the block, round the clock, bezel like
I roll like cherry red Jell-O dice
It's hot, just the block callin' the ghetto wife
This a hustler's due
And you ain't did it til' a hustler's do
And you didn't know it til' a hustler knew
And you ain't done til' a hustler's through
I'm a customer too, it's what hustler's do
And you ain't seen it til' you seen it from a hustler's view
Open your eyes, it's a hustler's song
God forgive if the hustle is wrong
It's bigger things so we Cosa Nostra
Striving to be number one til' I overdose
I speak it now with a number tongue all year through
Youngest son runnin' from older quotes
Thou shall not sin, thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
Thou shall not turn your back on those in need
I'm just a rose in weeds
And I rolls with reasons to stay on this road I lead
Til' I leave with what I sow, my sole in these
Leave my son with the sum of what I sold in deeds
I'm foldin' y'all,
It takes a lot of patience when you takin' it on
A lot of pacin', a lot of makin' it known
I was the king of this city, now they replacing the throne
I know it's a lot of hatin' waitin' at home
And she ain't waitin' you can hear the bass in her tone
Like she can't make it alone, a broken home
And she the brace for the bone
All this from just embracin' the phone
A lot of ballin' up letters, a lot of erasing the poems
A lot of comin to grips that you gonna be facin' alone
