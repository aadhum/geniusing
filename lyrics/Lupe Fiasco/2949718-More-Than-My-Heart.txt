When you got popped up and you got locked up
And the block shot up and your girl knocked up
And your kids be like, "Who gonna watch us?"
Your mama, they nana
When you ball too hard or your money got spent
So you got kicked out, you ain't have no rent
But you still had a place where you could go
Tell me where you went, yooooour mama
Soon as they let me outta jail
Went straight to my mama's house
Who visit when niggas don't visit?
Man, she the realest, boy, let me tell you somethin'
You better love your mama
I love my mama (I love my mama)
More than I love myself (more than I love myself)
Some mamas might wait 'til you get home
Some mamas might come up to your school
And fuck you up in front of your friends
'Cause you don't make the rules
Yeah, now some might think their mama ain't perfect, she is
All in her face, better get in your place
You're one of her goddamn kids
Now some might think their mama ain't worth it, she is
Gotta help her out no matter what it's 'bout
No matter whatever she did
Now some might think their mama ain't here
She lives
She lives
She lives
She lives
She lives
She lives
She lives
