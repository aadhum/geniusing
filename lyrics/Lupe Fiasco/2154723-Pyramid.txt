[Produced by Flying Lotus]
FlyLo, Lupe, I go
Upset stomach on the boat to Lucerne to see the lion
Carved in the wall by the pond
To commemorate the soldier dying over old divines
Ergo sum empire
not the inch but the entire
How many millionaires can the slums hold?
Potentially all of us, this whole plane and all the bus
As juggernauts bust through a wall of trust
You strain to see through the fog of dust
Like spaghetti for the meatballs
On boats in the Bay of Pigs
Don't shoe us, cause we ain't Bush
Twerk team, Operation Build-a-Butt
Great like Gildersleeve
Filtering lean through a gold grill
She too teenage to have a drug of choice
But she fuck with that Royce like she love Detroit
She rollin'
