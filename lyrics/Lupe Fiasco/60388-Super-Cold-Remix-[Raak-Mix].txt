[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Cold blooded, chilly skin
Can't touch it like your front wheel when it's Wheely-ing
Wanna see Chilly free like Free Willy friend
Wanted to see Free Willy really swim
I'm super cold, my jacket thin
I'm two below like a marching band
That means I'm super-deep, you surface skim
I'm the whole thing, you niggas 2%
Put em up on that carton, I think I'm losing em
Bring all those St. Bernards in
Let's get some booze in them
You know them dogs with them barrels on they neck
And I'mma keep it cool like airholes on a Tec
I be moving birds like the scarecrow's on the set
Part dope-ass nigga, an old man winter
Christmastime diamond singing carols on my chest
Step up off the jet
Looking like a Pharaoh in the flesh
Phil Rizutto flow
Good could be better, still I wish I knew what I know
Super cold, freezer burn, ugly and beautiful
Been in my zone for days, fortune favors the brave
Talent outshines hype, and hard work always pays
taupe melange
The flow is carolina blue, I wear b/red 1s every day
Free Chilly, Free Haas, Free Jimmy
Free Big Meech, Free Tony
The flow is swell, Free Willy
A long way from a snot nose
Free lunch and two pennies
I'm taking it to the Moon
And I'mma let them know I'm from North Philly
Im with Liva and it's ironic
Phoebe Philo rockin
Color temperature climate
I'm out of here, Harry Kalas
Louboutins
Under Phillip Lims
The Coupe's color banana pudding
The same exact one the proof is in
Blinded by that glare off of that spotlight that they view us in
Mandarin - Oriental, Red Eye--they flew us in
She half black, Speak Spanish
She Afro and Peruvian
Gansevoort, Sofitel, K West and we lose it in
Like you pretend
But the bow on the hood of the 2 door crept up with the bluest tint
I'm flying off, wings out
Been a while, I'm working hard
It's my time, I'm moving in
The best writer, hands down
I'm blacking out, nigga, rufilin
