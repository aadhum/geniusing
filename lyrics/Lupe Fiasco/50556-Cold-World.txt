Its just the talk of the town
Little did you know
You've been bleeding from the start
I'm leaving on ya mark
5th steady
Wait (weight) nigga
Waste (waist) bigger
If non sense is ya conscience
Your sitting on your shoulders
Sitting on mines or talking about theres
Sunlights to dark
Down right converse
If you dont know what to say in flow
Just dont make a sound like the K in known/no
Listen to the hustler babble
Just thumb tacks and a run flat
And im not letting it Go I mastered this
