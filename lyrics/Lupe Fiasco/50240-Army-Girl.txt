Yeah just my army
Lookin for my army
Cause your my army
Lookin for my army girl
Smarter than a mug, heart full of love
My zone is the home of the cubs
Westside where I reside
Just a rose that was grown from the mud
Just fly from her toes to the skull
Your peer pressure well we'll be fine
Insects we be fly
be high
Bun B and queen
Straight edge, great cred, well read, well versed
Like me, love god, Mashallah, go to church
Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco
She is my respiration
When im breathless when the roads rough
She my exit when I came in what I left with
Shes my right now and my next year
She ride we ride
