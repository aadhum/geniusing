f I see him in the streets it's getting motherfuckin' ugly
Now I know you might be a fan
And me and him share similar shit and you like "damn"
We gonna stick to what's at hand
I said "Did you heard that?"
They said "what?"
I said "You didn't heard the thing
About how they gave sixteen shots to McDonalds
While he was on the ground right outside of Burger King?"
They said "How could it?"
I said "You ain't see it?"
He said "Nah, they erased the footage"
Sounds like the motherfuckin' police
That's why sometimes to protect them kids
You gotta keep them pigs on a real short leash
But they protection
