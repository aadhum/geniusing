They say real recognize real
the pills
Is dealed like flaccid
proceeds go towards the buying of Caprice Classics
With the wheels to match it, so they can mack it
Like an automatic weapon stepping off into traffic
Like, check him, tears roll down the eyes
Of the rides inside of a funeral procession
They say the streets is a demon in a dress
Wit dollar signs in her eyes and semen on her breath (UH!)
Scantly clad, no panties, deep throating in an alley
Aging badly in sunglasses she pretty
Slain boyfriend names is tattooed on her titties
Sprinkling greed, ignorance, and envy inside of a Philly
ass will bring ya enemy's here
Flirt wit her flaws till you run up in her raw
They say the game has the belly of a beast
Blunts for fingers and hollow tips for teeth
Wire taps for ears, Nike Airs for feet
Blasphemy for prayers, a system for a heart
Rap music for beats, heroin for a son and it's married to the streets
Crack pipes for lungs, and he never sleeps
Just spies, wit dice in his eyes
Loves life cuz he likes when it dies
Wit a baking soda soul, he cough up pleasure
Clothes made out of dollar bills that he sewed together
But, righteousness is a father teaching his kids
That what's better than wealth is the respect in itself
A pistol packing old lady standing up to the dope dealers
On the block making sure her presence is felt
A teacher teaching that thinking is cool
Listen before you mention "not letting school turn them into fools"
