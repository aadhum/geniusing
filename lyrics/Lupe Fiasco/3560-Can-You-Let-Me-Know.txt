Chicago, mayne
I ain't like them tricks, I treat better
Baby, I'm down to do whatever
I don't really care, it doesn't matter
Let's not waste no time
Baby, let's, go
Love, you gotta love it
Hold hands in public
I does it
Cool
I dug it
Everything you do
And everything you doesn't
Everything you done, hope I'm the one, you does it
Too
Hope this trick goes wrong, then I'm cuttin'
Too
So I can feel it twice as much as two Lu's
To lose is something that I never wanna do
I'm too loose to check on this track like choo-
Choos
To choose, I rather have you
Even if it's half
And I don't even hold for the whole
If I have two
But I don't want a one
That's too close to none
Come
But get rid of the gun
It's covered in clues
The one that you use,
to kill off the playa inside
And I
Bought back some flowers from the funeral
For ya
You should come and make moves with a brother like
It all happened in a second
My universe froze
Ain't a situation I chose
But it, chose me
When I caught a glimpse
Of you
Beautiful, just posin'
I know that
All them rappers, we talkin' 'bout
Hoes and clothes
But she ain't that type, ya see
I need to get warm
She's my Q
I gotta transform
So I can come
Through when whatever she wants
charm with the four seas
