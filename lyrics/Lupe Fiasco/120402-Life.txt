From city to city, I really did it for y'all
From the itty bitty small, to the really really tall
Where they paw, and they living in a shelter
Begging with their kids, they're too helpless to help her
If you walk in trailer park today
Or a park where the ground is too harsh to lay
Or the projects where there's no park to play
And it's too dark to read
And you're too marked to leave
And that's strength
And you gotta be strong
When the dramas on your back
And your clothes don't match
And your father is gone
And on top of all that
The water isn't on
And your dishes don't match
The teachers say they only come to school to flunk
But there's some that only go to school for lunch
And that's life
Because they say it's a miracle
If we live to see 24
