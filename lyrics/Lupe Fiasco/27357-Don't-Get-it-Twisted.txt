"Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!"
Westside,
I'm only gonna do this once, man
Once
Till the album come
From the M-A...D-I, to the S to the O-N,
Crucial conflict was smokin',
but a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at low speed, low key, like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf,
both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the oki-dokin',
Stash-box for the police pokin',
Rolie showin, shorty showin
Hokey Pokin',
I'm in it from the minute I was in it, 'til the minute that I spit it and I'm finished,
and it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance, revisit and make 'em give it back to me
All right, that's all you get
I'm done
You know what I'm sayin'?
In the streets where they traffic me
Nigga what
