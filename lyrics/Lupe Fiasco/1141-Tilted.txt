I was like Porsche puller,
Air Force footer
Automatic wristed therefore shook-up
Causing a stir every time I push up
007
It's Carrera-Ella
from the F&F crew
With a tiger on his shirt, alligator on his blues
righteous kung-fu
I'm fighting without fighting, enlightening you young fools
Frankensteins of mine I tighten you young screws
Send lighting to your mind and make you move
Car like cannonball, Run!
I'm lighting my guns fuse, One:
That mean I'll lean and leave you,
I'm mean as needles
They hook to my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles
I can't even see you

[Hook]
With it Tilted
Brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (Tilted)
Brim Low, brim low
With a Cartier eye
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh tha def F&F!
I wear Cartier glasses,
Van dutch pants-es
Game boy advances next to the black berry
I'm next to my black berry Molasses
Hat very slanted
rapping to the riders
Writer of the stances driver of the riders
The serve is so mean like I served in the marines
And it's full metal jacket
Upset the jokers every time I draft it
They trys to jack it
change my will
I can wait for triple A
I chill
And I mean it needles
Just hook em with my hooks, they rehearse my verse
And they sing my singles
Cause it Tilted
Brim low, brim low
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (Tilted)
Brim Low, brim low
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
F, F I to the A S C O
Flyn' like Neo
They lien' like Leo, Cleo
maybe they fronted
But they ain't never done it like he though
Reffering to me
Joe!
I feed them through the bars like CO's
I lead them through the harm like a Hero
Peaceful
But I can bring the violence like Nero
Right to your keyhole then bring it back to silence
Cause that's the G-Code
Which means that if you brought it or your about to bring it on
But tell the polices I ain't seen it because I had it
Tilted
Brim low, brim low
With a Cartier eye
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Tilted (Tilted)
Brim Low, brim low
With a Cartier eye
And his car go by like
NEEEEEEOOOOOWWWWW!
Fresh tha def F&F!
