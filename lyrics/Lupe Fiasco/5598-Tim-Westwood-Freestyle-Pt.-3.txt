[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Fire flame spitta
On another track
don't want none of that
With no water
and no slaughter
No breaks I just continue on,
with no takes
I keep going, I keep flowing, no stopping that
And see everybody watching that
See I got the lock so I'll be locking that, you can't get the keys
Especially from me, I keep them so excited
in my pocket
You'd better watch it, and matter of fact
you'd better stop it
My flow is like...Heckler and Koch
I ain't hitting hearts, I'm just aiming for the brains
Trying to make'em smarter and take'em out of danger's way
And say maintain today
I show the shorties how to maintain the way so righteous
iceless
I got a couple those watches
you can back watch it
You better backstop it like
it's cricket
I keep a wicket googly
when I stick it, be like the Batman, hitcha
You can come through just like don't pitch it out
I'll knock it out the park
it'll be so dark
By the time I'm done, there'll be no sun
There'll be no one, see the crowd so empty
I'll still be there rhyming, see it don't tempt me
Turning niggas' worlds around and show them there's better ways to get it down
Look at my god and bow my head down to heaven
I pray to the East
I try to do it seven times a day
Do it my way
may god forgive me for the prayers that I didn't do
And for the fasts that I didn't fast
I hope you make my success last longer than the rest of them
Or if not keep me so intelligent that I stay beyond it and don't care about their success or their chains
you try and put it in the trash
But it jumps out the garbage and still returns to be the hardest on the market
