Said you gonna be slow if I pour up
But i'm gonna be poor if I slow up
Can't find a job, you can rap at least
'Cause that's what I did, I was at that leg
Right out of high school, tryna stack that cheese
You was tryna do what? tryna stack that cheese
You wanna flip burgers, wanna stack that cheese
Make American singles, wanna stack that cheese
Make everybody smile, tryna stack that cheese
Tryna do it for a while, tryna stack that cheese
Talking frequent flyer miles, how I stack that cheese
Tryna bundle up the money, tryna stack that cheese
Aye Stack, can we stack that please?
