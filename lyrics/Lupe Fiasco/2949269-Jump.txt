Gold medals, them my role models
rollin' old models
Lowered old schools
flowin' cold and goin' gold follows
Flower bearin', call it petals to the floor
droppin' at the feet of my sun
Move a thousand miles per hour down the street of my slum
It was little Susie Uzi, she sold crack and was a killer
figures
Her influence fully automatic, crackin' off the Richter, yeah
Walked up to my ride, asked me could she get inside
She pointed at her pistol so I properly replied
Told me, out here in the streets, she ain't have no competition
And with me up on them beats, then we shared the same description
With a blunt between her lips, she said, "Now here's my proposition:
You just write a bunch of raps for me and I'ma go and spit 'em
Then we take 'em to the radio, the DJ better spin 'em
Then we take 'em to the record store and sell a couple million", woo
[Hook: Gizzle]
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
Uh, tell me call up Soundtrakk, have him send a couple beats
Not that "Superstar" shit, she wanted somethin' for the streets
Said it might take like a month, she said it better take a week
Gave my arm a little punch and then she pointed at her heat
Said, "I saw that thing the first time, you don't gotta do it twice
But I need a lil' more info on exactly what I write
Some details 'bout a female, 'bout your life and what you like"
My life is like a bitch, and I'm just like my life
Then pow-pow-pow-pow-pow, yeah, them niggas started bussin'
Like that boycott was over and that we had overcome it
went from zero to a hunnid
She was hangin' out the window with that thumper she was dumpin'
Had a look upon her face that made me think that she was cummin'
jumped the curb and ditched the whip
Tried to jump over a wall, but it was a little tall
I was shook and breathin' hard and she was sittin' there smokin' kush
Then we both started to glow, we looked around like, "What is this?"
And then we looked up and a light, came down and pulled us to a ship
Like, "What the fuck?"
[Hook: Gizzle]
[Verse 3: Gizzle]
Break down some of that candy and roll it up in a wrapper
And who needs Atlanta when you're on Saturn gettin' a lap dance
With a lit match in your left hand and your right hand is a gas can
And at any given moment, I could burn this shit up
Why you standin' there just lookin', nigga? Turn that shit up
Hop in some of this alien pussy, let me know how it work
I'm just sayin', I'm gon' be there and I ain't in no rush
Nah nigga, nah nigga, I ain't in no rush
Ayy, I thought you couldn't rap, when'd you learn how to do that?
Then what you need me for if you already know how to flow?
Ayy, fuck that, we gotta go, wouldn't even be in this hoe
If you told me from the jump we wouldn't be on this UFO
[Hook: Gizzle & Lupe Fiasco]
I already got the money, already got the bitches
I see these other niggas, I'ma do it how they did it
Nigga we're goin' home, home!
From a trapper to a rapper, trapper to a rapper
Trapper to a rapper, now nigga, make it happen
You can kill me, I don't careâ€”no!
