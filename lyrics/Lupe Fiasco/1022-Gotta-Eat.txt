My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Hey, he had a whole lotta cheese
Plus he was a mack, had a whole lotta steez
Made a lot of niggas fat, gave a whole lotta Gs
Grams, man, he had a whole lotta these
And he would let you hold, like, a whole lotta keys
Even if you lose some he would give you new ones
And he had a whole lotta seeds
Even his kids had meals for reals
Some rich small fries wrapped in paper since they was lil'
Catch up, nigga

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
He was a heart breaker
and a law shaker
If it was bout caking, he was a partaker
International, he would take trips, bon voyage
That's how hard he was fishing for the chips
So greedy he never gave to the needy, that's what some say
Delivery man on the pick-up drive through and throw a bag at 'em
And it was hard to understand him sometimes
Making a killing the way he had 'em standing in line

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Went to church on a Sunday and saw a deep friar
He loved the hungry ones, was only scared of the feds
He lived the fast life, couldn't get his path right
Friar just told him 'bout the hooters that he had last night
Turned himself in to the paddy wagon, said no
Bacon wouldn't take him, half the pigs on the payroll

My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
Streets be all like, "Feed me, feed me"
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
My man said life ain't easy
When niggas gotta eat, that's when shit get greasy
