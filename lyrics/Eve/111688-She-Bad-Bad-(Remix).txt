Potluck Push, dip your hand in my grab bag
Matte black Benz, perfect for my black ass
Only know who's in it when I open the back half
Hot as a backdraft, they know he on fire
Any nigga deny it, you call his mother a liar
Trynna take her ghetto chic and put her up on designer
Oh she bad bad, so fly she jet lagged
[Verse 2: Eve]
Yeah, that’s right, I’m badder than them
E-V-E, the cataclysm
Blow 'em out the fucking water
Kill ‘em dead, called a slaughter
Ain’t my fault, I had it built up
Had to get it out my system
Now I’m back
Forget about them other chicks, man, you won’t miss ‘em
Yeah, E-V-E hungry like a lion
I ain’t never easy
Never scared, why you tryin'?
Your gimmick make me sicky
What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'
Man, I live up at the top so you keep climbin'
No they can never catch-a
Me, I’m the chick that keep ‘em under pressure
And every nigga smell her wanna sex her
They say they won't protect her
But really they just want kiss and caress her
Now sit your ass down
Cause class is now in session
Rollin' papers and rollin' swishers
Gettin' becky from a white stripper
