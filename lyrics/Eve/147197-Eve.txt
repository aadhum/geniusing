Step back, where she at, man I’m in my zone
If you can’t keep up with where I’m at
Then take your ass back home
Raise the flag and tell the people come
The queen is on the throne
Watch how they leave you standing there
Just leave you all alone
You a clone of a bunch of people
Go and get your own
I’m a Philly born, bred, raised, never left my bones
Ain’t no guessing it’s E-V-E
I’m the chick that they wish they’d be
I’m the reason you wanna hide
Smile on your face, fear in your eyes
I’m E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
E-E-V-E
