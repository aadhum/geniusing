Rubia huh? Papi screamin out of they mouth
What I need from a nigga negative in his sound
Au-dacity, even, askin me
For ass,
Swattin em off, when I see this nigga's a flea
Plottin of course for riches, millionaire wannabe
Popular since I started my life
Eve you know my name, probably the dangerous type
Not this baby Del-Philly streets they raisin her right
Keep it pretty or can make it gritty be a LADY!
Need boots pocket books and a baby 380!
Leave her be, chicken squakin hatin frequently
Mad they man is obsessed and stalkin me
If he, icy enough, I'm pricin his stuff
Ruff Ryders put in they work
Snatched up the illest viscous pitbull in a skirt
haters steady dishin up dirt
Want some more? It ain't over, just keep pressin rewind, uh
