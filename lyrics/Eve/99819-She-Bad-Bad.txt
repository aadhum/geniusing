[Hook]
They’re like
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad, oh she bad bad
Oh she bad bad
Yeah, that’s right, I’m badder than them
E-V-E, the cataclysm
Blow 'em out the fucking water
Kill ‘em dead, called a slaughter
Ain’t my fault, I had it built up
Yeah, E-V-E hungry like a lion
Your gimmick make me sicky
What you're sellin' I ain't buyin'
Man, I live up at the top so you keep climbin'
Me, I’m the chick that keep ‘em under pressure
And every nigga smell her wanna sex her
They say they won't protect her
But really they just wan' kiss and caress her
Now sit your ass down
Cause class is now in session
When they see me comin' at ‘em
Heels and hips, they wanna grab ‘em
Lips and now I'm starin' at ‘em
Mesmerized, gotta have it
Yeah, the type of chick that like them big trips
Big jets, mega yachts, yeah, big ships
You know my style already scorpion, she stings, she lethal
