Now I'mma do this thing like it ain't done before
A lotta niggas is bitches, a lotta bitches be trippin'
A lotta them be wishin' that they was in my position
A lotta niggas be cowards and most chicks be chickens
Fuck 'bout the CLUCK! CLUCK! Eve ain't trippin'
Dre and Bombshell, don't you love how it blend?
I know you hopin' that I rest so you can breathe
Stressed when we in the same places 'till I leave
Whisper to they friends what they wanna do to me
Never let you muhfuckas put out my flame
Ready for whatever, was trained to maintain
And I always been a savage 'bout the fame
Anything I want
I'mma get it 'cuz I know I need it
Still I Ruff Ryde but I got my team
They never thought that I would make it rappin'
