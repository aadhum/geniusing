Drop your glasses, shake your asses
Face screwed up like you having hot flashes
Red from blonde, yeah bitch I'm drastic
Some of y'all niggas hot; psych, I'm gassin'
Easy come, easy go, E-V gon' be lastin'
Jealousy, let it go, results could be tragic
Some of y'all ain't writing well, too concerned with fashion
None of you ain't Giselle, cat walk and imagine
A lot of y'all Hollywood, drama, casted
Cut bitch, camera off, real shit, blast it
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind
Shank up, haters wanna come after me
You ain't a gangster, prankster,
Now why you gritting your teeth?
Frustration baby you got to breathe
Take a lot more than you to get rid of me
You see I do what they can't do, I just do me
Meet me in the lab, pen and pad, don't believe
Huh, sixteens mine, create my own lines
Love for my wordplay that's hard to find
Sophomore, I ain't scared, one of a kind
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind
mash out
Yeah nigga, mash out, D-R-E
Back track, make that, E-V-E
Ryde or Die bitch, double R, came strong
If I had to give you more, it's only been a year
Now I've got my foot through the door, and I ain't going nowhere
It took a while to get me here, and I'm gonna take my time
Don't fight that good shit in your ear, now let me blow ya mind
