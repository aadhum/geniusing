My mind flashes, I see the ashes of the masters
Who touch the masses, I ask if I'll ever be one
Desires of a church choir, Trinity United
Memories divided by perception
Will it be Water for Chocolate or Resurrection?
An underground dude that overachieve
From the windy city I was blowing they eaves
Somewhere along the way I aired out MCs
Yo, the anticipation arose as time froze
The black men in the morgue were John Does
Lynched for whistling at blonde does
The quills that I dip into the ink go to document
And you'll remember me when I'm extinct
Who slew Leviathan with one arrow
have heart, must travel
I don't survive 'til the curtain call
Frozen in time, I can't let it go
Nat Cole, Unforgettable
The pedestal I'm on, I'mma end up on the Federal
Reserve note your money with a hip hop quote
I might change legislation with some shit that I wrote
From boats that we came on to lights with our name on
we spark minds to keep the flame on
I write hard rhymes like I'm running out of time
Centuries from now, they'll play my freestyle
And say, this is the brilliance of a Black American child
Chi
Known to move in silence, but can be loud
The noise of beat girls and boys
Building to destroy the perception of urban aggression
