[Hook: Wadud Ahmad]
America's lost somewhere inside of Littleton
Eleven million children are on Ritalin
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media, we don't need it do we?
Pilgrims, Slaves, Indian, Mexican
That's why I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
False media
If I can't work to make it, I'll rob and take it
Either that or me and my children are starving and naked
Rather be a criminal pro than to follow the Matrix
Hey it's me a monster y'all done created
I've been inaugurated
Keep the bright lights out of our faces
We gone pimp, the shit out of nature
Send our troops to get my paper
Tell 'em stay away from them skyscrapers
Ain't long for you get y'all acres
I'mma show 'em who's the global gangster
Sentence me to four more years, thank you
I'mma make you feel a little bit safer
Because it ain't over
See that's how we get your fear to control you
