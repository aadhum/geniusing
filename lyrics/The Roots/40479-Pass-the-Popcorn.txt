Yeah, The Square Roots be the setters of examples
Findin' rhythm in the static of your samples
The first verse is poured I pass the popcorn
[Verse 2: ?uestlove]
S-Q-T (Square Roots)
All the way from Philly, from the West part
Now the second verse has been pourn
On to Kid Crumb I pass the popcorn
I wanna be a pioneer so trails I blaze
