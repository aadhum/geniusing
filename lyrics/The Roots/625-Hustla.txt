Let me tell you what priceless is, some advice to give
They say life's a bitch
but it's one life to live
I want my baby where that cake and the icing is
Out of them crisis-es, off of them vices-es
They see what we do and grow up in all likenesses
Really I don't wanna see em having to fight for this
Story of the family biz, I'mma rewrite the script
Daughter of a hip-hopper
From being independent, earning paper and proper
More like a lawyer or a doctor, not a man-watcher
I'm trying to make a black diamond or a pearl out yeah
I thank heaven for my little girl
Better be a hustla, baby be a hustla
If not, then you're only a customer
I'm slicker than a squid, nigga no kids
Sugar free from the drama
no sweat like a sauna
No judge, your honor can't tell me to raise mine
Figured that in due time, if and when I do find
True love, Buddha
maybe you can blue-line
G, I'm all about the green like tree pines
See I'm tryin' to get the scratch like a feline
Hustlin' to make a buck, make a buck and fuck it up
Fuck it up and suck it up, then go and make another buck
I'm hopin' that my seeds know a little more than I know
