I just don't like them sticky grits
[T] That's the grits that needs cash man!
I like my grits with sugar man
[B] I like them with BUTTER
Gettin grits y'all (Say what?) Bust it, let a
Brother tell another bout real grits getters
Now me, I'm out to get the grits, more than a little bit
If I said, "Don't get it Black," you know I'd be a hypocrite
Levels often fluctuate to surplus from deficit
I, slides, AND, slips, AND, dives, AND, dips
Into it
it being grits that I gets like a quaker
But take the raincoats, for the oats
I dig my grits fixed slow
With butter
make em other
Some people call it skins but, grits is the other term
That you gots to learn, to keep up on all the scoop
I get a little ends but, never spends loot
some immature, kids like to laugh
So they giggle for the grits and, when they get close
They start skitz-in, not this kid, because I switched in
Flipped in, changed the position that I hits in-side
I glide
Like, hittin a doobie, Thought'll get ya groovy, so!
Your wife's nice so you better keep the girls away
From the grits getter
Yeah I likes to unzip it, strip it then grip it
To be specific I won't lick it, so get the ticket
worm on Noah's Ark
Guess I haves to rest my lumber for the next number to sum
shovel's diggin deep
Her performance showed endurance
sorta served me
Like she was a waitress
Never will I say that she was tasteless
when I choose to move I puts my shoes on
Protection, against infection
Erect projections travels South in your mouth
Like a dentist checked in, commence to be intent
She said, "I can't understand you, but damn you like Prince"
Zulu
By the way she roll away like a dog who name was Ubu
imprint on you dentures when I bust
Or I thrust, Mid-Atlantic, they act like a schitzophrenic
Sometimes they panic like I'm Diggin on a Planet
Humans get picky, and judge it by the thickness
But if it bends your spoon then add some butter with the quickness
You can add some groovy spices, to give it extra
But my advice is to first let it simmer
Hot, if it's hot then let the pot sit and cool
Cause if you spill your milk, we label you beginner
Humans gotta know, that I keep my bowl, full of grits
Pazi Plant
Kick a cat, but I won't lick a cat, I'll figure
I'd rather, play the thigh kisser, sister
I don't die swift, and yo I'm not a quitter
My way to the right nip and left nip then sip
grab my pack of hats
From the back,
