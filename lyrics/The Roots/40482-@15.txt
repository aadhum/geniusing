Verse 1: Black Thought
I have black thoughts, therefore my name's the same
Leave MC's blind with amnesia
Get benched by the coach, like eggs you're poached
I wrote murder, so you can say it's Murder He Wrote
When I say "Maestro" and bro starts to play it
If you got a rhyme in your mind, then don't say it
Save it for the weaker, pack your portable speaker
And utilize the treads on your sneaker
