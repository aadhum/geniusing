feelin the steam from the cauldron
Many are called, but so few are chosen
of medication uppin my dosage
Bangin Earth, Wind & Fire "Devotion"
Takin the city with a grain of salt
malt - liquor
I ain't trippin not a Bobby Brown, lippin with my nose runnin
And then got ghost, like my picture was on a most wanted
Coast to coast, from L.A. to Chicago
Now I'm faced, with the weight of survival,
