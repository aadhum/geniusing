Look - my squad half-Mandrill, half-Mandela
My band about seventy strong just like Fela
Yeah, part Melle-Mel,
part Van Halen
And we represent Illadel, where they still rebellin'
Hey yo, sicko show like Mike Moore
My city ain't nothin' like yours
Slippin' into darkness like war
Night crawl with the lights off
You see a lot of life lost for the white horse
Regardless, the charges making us all targets
(Get busy)
Worldwide
(Get busy)
Approach with caution, be cautious when talking to bosses
I feel I've been through a metamorphosis
I'm mutated by unknown forces
The feeling of course is
Somethin' that's hard to describe
I'm half-dead, never felt more alive
Reborn, remove the gold coins from my eyes
Cause I crack up when a rapper get slapped up
Dice, it's mines, I got it all wrapped up
I'm kind of like W.E.B. Du Bois
Meets Heavy D and the Boyz
Smooth as a Rolls Royce
Built like a tank,
smokin' on dank
Walkin' through the Guggenheim
Raw Life, Black Inc
Now on your mark, get set
Go cop everything you ever heard by P. Crack
Dice Raw and Black
Fuck the Internet
Buy a baseball bat, break a bootlegger leg
All I listen to is vets, you're fresh off the step
I'll come directly at your OG neck
I'm used to the 1-2 check, not the 1-2 step
I'm strapped, I'll leave every cat among you wet
Now let's go, you know I'm politically incorrect
At the show, I start it with a
"Can I get a ho?"
And the ho's go retarded
The po-po tape off the stage for caution
It's bad lands, North Philly get it in
It's Crack man
used to back spin
Now I spend stacks and stacks
And Uncle Sam tryin' to tax all my hard-earned raps
Damn,
we making yens, pesos, euros - we representin'
