[Hook: Truck North]
And I can see it's all about cash
Look, it is what it is because of what it was
I did what I did cause it does what it does
My family, my blood, my city and my hood
I never did it by the good book
If there's a God, I don't know if he listening or what
Get greeted like a nigga if a nigga's all you show
A public enemy that's in the eye of the scope
My city like a island where you can't find a boat
And praying that hope floats
Screaming "fuck the mayor"
He see the faces at the bottom of the well clear
Trapped in urban warfare
And putting triggers ahead a college career
To the rules, I will not adhere
Break the law, yeah
D's sneak attack, arraign me, it took a week for that
