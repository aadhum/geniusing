Jim Carrey ass niggas start to melt
now vacant the vicinity
I'm symbolic to a ballot, it's Abdul Malik
Don't approach with bullshit, I'm quick to call it invalid
dowa
I still fast, make salaat and pay zakaat
I didn't make Hajj yet, but that's my next project
tawwaf around the ka'ba
I used to live life, like there was no ma√±ana
Now I'm treating every breath, like it was your honor
