[Malik B.]
I'm exhausted, but I never ever forfeit
The street and the slums, the weekend is done
The local class always show you what heat is become
The seasons are done, and reasons are none
People dyin' bullets flyin' cause they squeezin' for fun
They sing about murder, so it ain't a song it's hollerin'
Get off the choir with your soft attire
My city's full of, heartbreakers and stargazers
Who puff garsh Vegas
So they "Gone With The Wind", like Clark Gable
Breathin' like Darth Vader
Yeah, we got flags, but they not star-spangled
It's Idle/Idol Worship
Yo
We on some casualties of war shit
What you stand for, kid?
We in the city where they definitely lost it
You open your eye-lids and get capped in the ribs
Your funeral they have your 12th grade portrait
Now he in a box with the same chain and watch
That never came off him
It's a shame what it cost him
It's chambers revolvin'
Bustin' like Russian roulette
With a full set, they change what the odds is
