Left so many clues, now how could they miss it?
One for the pressing, two for the cross
Three for the blessing, four for the loss
In a war taking heads from men like Charles Taylor
13-year-old killer, he look 35
He changed his name to Little No-Man-Survive
When he smoke that leaf, shorty believe he can fly
My manner, seems patient, inner rage lies
So deep, I can taste it, let's sacrifice lives
Past the first sensation, to paradise I fly
Delusions are lighting up the midday sky
Wolves dressed like sheep occur more frequently
Towers of the occupiers, will soon fall
Martyr or mass murderer? That's your call
Mass transit or a mall? Who can watch them all?
