land of the unseen hand that holds trouble
Theorize your game
it's difficult to roll a double
bridge and tunnel vision
That's the reason the system making this paper from the prison
And that's the reason we living where they don't wanna visit
Where the dope slangin'
swangin' like Sonny Liston
Get the brain kicking
Remember back in the days, when the kitchen had eggs
And pancakes, chicken and greens and Kool Aid?
When the refrigerator naked and the cupboard is bare
People got to strip naked, stick 'em up in the air
Was it lies when they told you wasn't nothing to fear?
Something don't feel right out here
And when I'm writing my thoughts out, really I'm boxing
Freeze your face like botulinum toxin
If you ain't trying to get popped, then give me a option
Helicopters chopping from Philly to Compton
If you ain't saying nothing, you the system's accomplice
I'm overseeing anything within my circumference
You mesmerized by the calm nonchalantness
I spin a dark web on some John Hitchcock shit
If you ain't speaking your life, your rhyme's adopted
If it don't feel right, then stop it, you know what I'm sayin'?
children working
Natural disaster got the planet in a panic
Sex, drugs, murder, politics and religion
Forms of hustling
Worldwide, we coincide with who suffering
Hot zone
You fuck around, be a enemy of the state, black
Ill, but that's too real for TV
If you don't got no paper, then steal this CD
Listen man, I'll let you know how it feel to be me
