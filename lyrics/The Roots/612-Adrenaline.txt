Yo, Adrenaline
Yo I'm in the eye of the storm, where the pressure's on
And MC's is dressed funny like a leprechuan
I chop rappers up like chicken szechuan
my zodiac sign read caution
The Fifth foursome
You don't want no more son? That's when more come
And drag a nigga Erie Avenue to Oregon, you're all done
Select the weapon at the gate upon entering, The Roots instrumentaling
them niggas try to talk shit
We hit em like the L at 60th and Market
South Philly clip a hole into a nigga pocket
Fifth mic terrorist
Zigga zigga zigga tryin to get a grip but still slip
Yeah Malik B from The Roots, he ain't gone
I took the wrong exit, the sign said Langhorne
Knotts Landing
I'm Ralph Kramden, we out, you'll see in Hampton
Beans
hide they face like ostriches
You need a special kind of mic for retarded kids
Me against you's like Kane verse the Partridges
[Beanie Sigel]
I'ma quiet them
plier em
Know the bricks is in here, where you hiding em?
Paid the front row seat watching Iverson
First class air crafts what I'm flying in
To L.A., Shaq, Eddie, Kobe Bryant and them
Save the jokes for Chris Tucker, Richard Pryor and them
Used to shotgun in cars, now I'm driving em
Grew up, two-four, wit Pie and em
But do my dirt, 21st, wit Kyle and them
chalking em
Illadel
