To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin the mind
All my peoples that be knowin the time; c'mon
And push up ya lighter, up ya lighter
Up ya lighter, 'fore we spark the fire
To all my peoples on the planet stimulatin the mind

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority
Is what I'm probably on, if I ain't whipping a Land'
Throughout ya sec-tion
Nine times out of time I rhymes upon the L Train
Stepped off at City Hall into the rain
And ran into my nigga named Dane - I mean Hakeem
And we was building on how we could organize the team
For this capital gain being that we in the rap game
It's time to have it all, he said he figured he same
We realized this a planet of CREAM
He dropped me off within the streets of South Phil'
Where niggas think that killing's living real
Shorties is getting wetted, fulfilling their fantasies to set it
We don't sweat it, by The Fifth you get beheaded
I pivot through my borough giving pounds to the dreaded
At the lye spots I got credit; could run em down
In alphabetic-al order it's sorta pathetic
I'm livin life within a labryinth of nonsense
'iminals
Treat MC's with bigotry,
Niggas hearts so cold, they sport frost
M-the-Illi-tant
Bad Lieutenant
You're now a victim of reality, my personality
Inclined to rap about facts, I never fake jacks
Shit is Real like E packs
Plain Jane styles internal, to the naked eye
Derived from mindstates of Cold Crush tapes
