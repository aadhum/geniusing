[Intro]
Black Rock
Yo, what's for breakfast?
Same as yesterday
Oh that's right cheeseburger and a 40 ounce
Hey, what's for dinner? Nothing nigga
But last night I had dreams of a porterhouse
Ay yo for real I feel like
Cattle in a slaughterhouse
But fuck that grow another here's a quarter ounce
It ain't no hydro, but it gets you high though
Them niggas look like cops what the fuck do I know
[Hook: Dice Raw]
At the end of this tunnel, it's red and blue lights
Once you pay the price you can never do right
One thing I know all I did is wrong
Maybe there ain't nowhere I belong
The only thing in front of me is a bullet in the head
They hoping one day that they find me dead
Until then I make a place in this world
For me and my baby girl
Yeah, yeah!
Got the dead drop way until the A.M
Mumbo Jumbo niggas onomatopoeian
Call it how I see them ain't no rhyme or reason
I'm on some different bullshit everyday just like per diem
Out of bandwidth, animal anguish
So love no bitch, die rich as the language
Guilty as sin, depending on a reed shaking in the wind
Just a question never answered out here depending on its end
