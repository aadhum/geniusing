Nuttin new, nuttin new, y'all not sayin nuttin new
the legendary Fifth Dynasty crew
Y'all Dorito-head cats that yak and stagnated
The Doug E
Spliff wizard
Apex my level
my complex pattern of speech is like sex
I mastered the art of makin you snap the necks
And Chase Manhattan endorse my mic checks
Ultramagnet
Life's a gamble, step up and place your bets
I'm like, Lex Luthor with rifles filled with kryptonite
When you grip the mic it's like -- c'mon kids, let's say goodnight!
Confidin, North Phil' where I'm residin
Never let an outside nigga slide in
This ain't home plate, I dunk on you once inside the paint
Lambic Framboise
What's the cure for this hip-hop cancer?
What does it all mean? What's it all for?
With knowledge of yourself, then you're through the first door
Shaq did Ostertag
PSYCH
Shove a mic in your mouth, like
Ted DiBiase
