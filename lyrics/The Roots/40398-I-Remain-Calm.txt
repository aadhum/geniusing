I remain calm, lyrically I got the bomb
When you put me on, I remain calm
Cream of all crops, topics I drop with Trotter
I write an anthem throw a tantrum and remain handsome
That nigga Thought flows like a river, I deliver styles like Domino's
Eyes closed I inhale, equality follow me now son
Listen, my divisions advance, I surpass one half of the rap mass
The other half want my autograph
Because I got soul, plus a ghetto stroll, similar to Shaft
It's the mic rapers, splittin Phillies in the cellar
My acapella verse, can stomp, I delete comp
My rated X, larynx, wrecks your context
I'm complex, confusin, lyrically amusin, I drink brews
Then when I'm groovin I'm no longer human
See, I can have you headin for the border, like a ReFugee from Haiti
I asked him if he ever danced
In the dark, with the rap devil, Black Thought
I resound and astound and scare, I reign terror
Into another nigga rap era, my rhymes sedate
I lubricate, like aloe vera
