A'yo everybody on they jawns
Cartoons is hardcore porn
It ain't no afterschool paper routes and mowin lawns
Kids got backpacks full of yayo and heron
Coming to school shootin up the auditorium
The least of y'all worries should be Thought's cd
The chairman of the board coppin twice weekly
They done caught the minister with a pork b.l.t
If my shit ain't hot, it probly try to drive me
Psyhce, its somethin I can never let myself see
Its L for whoever try to front on Thought's shit
I'm sendin them goons to your mom's apartment
And rhymin like its the end of humanity
Behind the laughter they thinkin about jammin me
Stand here a new man, but I'm still the old boy
They claimin they sell but I'm still the old boss
Sometimes wings get clipped, we all hit the floor
Watchin different artists rise and fall
Mother fuckers jumpin ship like we came to rob at y'all
Kweli, sittin back in the cut like Reese
Baracudas movin and canoein sippin amaretto
