Living a lie eventually believing it's true
A lot of people here are frauds one could be you
It's outrageous and they just ain't nothing
But save us an ocean of brown fists in various flavors
Tell me what you would do with no phone or pagers
No Kinko's, no Fed Ex and no ATM's
What you gone do when the police state begin
Well it already began but I guess it depends on what's really going on
What's happening
Military target practicing
They finna write another Patriot Act again
And some might say that it's a waste of time
Cause ain't no amount of dancing finna break the bondage
We go to war and transcend space and time
When every record ain't a record just to shake behinds
You know the stakes is high
we in the face of drama
That's why we can't shake it or escape the problem
Its like a game of roulette the barrel revolving
They only wanna see us occupying a coffin
Believe it's on as long as we can still speak freely
