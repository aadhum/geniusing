C'mon.. and yes y'all
You are now in tune to the sounds..
Of the legendary..
foundation
Hey you listeners, stop what you're doin and
Set it in motion, it's the next movement
Word up, we got the HOT-HOT music, The HOT MUSIC (1X)
The HOT-HOT music, the HOT music (3X)
Yo, one, two, one-two one-two
That's how we usually start,
Thought
The Dalai Lama of the mic, the prime minister Thought
This directed to whoever in listening range
Yo the whole state of things in the world bout to change
Black rain fallin from the sky look strange
The ghetto is red hot, we steppin on flames
Yo, it's inflation on the price for fame
And it was all the same, but then the antidote came
The Black Thought, ill syllablist, out the Fifth
heavyweight rap shit I'm about to lift
Like
a phyllum lift up it's seed to sunlight
I plug in the mic, draw like a gunfight
I never use a cordless, or stand applaudless
Sippin cholorophyll out of ill silver goblets
I'm like a faucet, monopoly's the object
There ain't no way to cut this tap, you got ta get wet
Your head is throbbin and I ain't said shit yet
You are now in tune to the sounds
Of the legendary, foundation, check it out, uh
the formation of words to fit
Whether they skywriting your name, or you anonymous
You be speechless, with stinging sinuses
You need to buy a CD and stop rewindin this
shinin like a rugged amethyst
And at your music conference, I'm the panelist
Listen close to my poetry, I examine this
Like an analyst, to see if you can
Handle this
emcees
Freeze, stand still, nobody move
You theatrical as a Broadway play, this ain't Rent
One hundred percent, straight out the Basement
