What is it we wanna doooo..
Now that I'm allowed to be in love with you?
Now you're old enough to go and see the "R"-rated show, now
"R"-rated show
Yo, she said she was a magazine editor named, Janine
Backstage in high-heels and painted-on, jeans
Probably had the most, devious eyes I'd ever seen
She had sum'hin to hide she snuck in from out-side
And got, everybody gassed like the car I, drive
She said she came to see them Roots boys +Fall-Out+ live, but listen...
You see the girls look good
but they brains not ready
I talk to a woman, her mind is mo', steady
Probably sum'hin in the way they designed, that's mo' steady
But I shoulda know, better cause now I feel like America's
Underbelly R. Kelly gutter smut peddlers
Internet predators, chat-room irregulars
This not my twist, you tryna send me to the therapist, miss
Now, she told me cheddar cheese grits, two tomato fried fish
Cause she heard it's my dish, tryna be my sidekick
All the people all around thinkin she was my chick
Sayin, "Damn, the girl thick, but she ain't no twenty-six"
Now you're old enough to buy a gun
So many better ways of having fun
