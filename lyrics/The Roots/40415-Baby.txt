Slow down when you're hitting them corners
Fuck around, spill this 'gnac on my two hundred dollar suit
Your ma don't like to jitterbug, said this unholy music
Hip hop just so ridiculous, everything sounds so confusing
Nowadays ain't nothing like it was, one thing that showed the blues
Is this system so mysterious, can't let that stop the movement
Can't get no satisfaction, they all laughing, glad it's happening
All ringside for the main attraction
Acting a fool with a lust for action
Young girl caught in a crime of passion
Sitting there crying in designer fashion
Didn't blow, didn't have time for asking
"Somebody call for the ambulances", girl
[Verse 2]
Nowadays he ain't loving you like he was
And you ain't there just for using
Can't get no satisfaction
