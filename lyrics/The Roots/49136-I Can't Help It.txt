'Riq
Gazelle 650's
My head already so heavy, it's makin' the scales tip
I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it
Never said I'm ready for war, but I'm protected
Lost all semblance of hope
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child
With the time I felt love, that's gone now
Been replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds
Misery love misery
So why make friends? Let's make some enemies
K's
