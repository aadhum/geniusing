Yo bust it, I digs hip-hop, and rocks for hip-hop
Not R&B because to me that's not my style and
The R-double-O-quotes ain't for radio, but major soul
On the cloud I be relaxin from last night and shit
(?uestion, what ya doin?)
From the subway to the studio
Gots to break fast if we wanna get, to the bus
Runnin like a Mex for the border
A girl says, "Hey ain't y'all The Square Roots?"
And I'm like, "Heh, worrrd,"
And then the shorty passed the sign
