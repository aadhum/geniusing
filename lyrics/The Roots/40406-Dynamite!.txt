[Black Thought]
Uh uh, come on, S-P in the
touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite
touch this Illa-Fifth Dynamite
Illa-Fifth Dynamite
The sole missin link, what could MC's who listen think
It's Black Thought, open your eyes and don't blink
[Elo]
Mothafuckers sweatin me, beggin me just to get me on
Macro-cosmic, micro-master
Phil Phil-lay-lay
Yo, look in the mirror, watch what yourself say
I'm from S-P, no mortal man can test me
Your half-stepping ass could never fathom or grasp because
Yo we got a doctorate in cold-rockin it
*Bitch* my raps trick your optical
I'm movin like a smart missle
Aimed and guaranteed to hit you
Word up, but when the Fifth do get on and perform, you in for it
It ain't no way to cen-sor it, my style metaphoric
Sub-terrainean, never against the grain-ean
In your universe, my star's the most radiant
from 2-1-5
Two extremes collide like Jekyl and Hyde
vi near
