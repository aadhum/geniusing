Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
Just think, what if you could just, just blink yourself away?
I be the 5 foot 7, residing at the Mecca, rest address in south section
Used to cut class in the infinite pursuit of ass
Back in eighty-six
Easy with the chicks, I was a chocolate boy
Raised in the cellar with the rhythm like Ella
Walking mega-trife streets to the subway where I lay
Til the train stop, then a nigga hop
Used to do the pop dance to the Planet Rock
It's the MC sucka niggas envy
I got my contract in 1993
I wake up early in the morning, I mean early afternoon
Break a lyrical hymn of the stem like boom
I'm fly and when I die you'll put my shit upon my tomb
That nigga represented on the 28th of June
I'm representing Philly on the 28th of June
With my pistol in the face of hip hop, stick it for papes
Because I'm on a paper chase, yes I'm on a paper chase
My Timberlands are fully laced I be the Mr. Boogeyman
With records from 125th to Japan
I let them play like Donny Hathaway and shake a hand, shake a hand
Your lady tried to kick it, but I couldn't play my man
My niggas is my niggas ya see she didn't understand
Just think, what? What if you could, just blink, what?
Just blink yourself away?
As I proceed
I can make a hundred yard line start to dash
I can make a whole lake of fish start to splash
I can make Conan and the Titans clash
And I could make Metallica and Guns 'N Roses thrash
But now, all I do disperse the verb
And like a nerd I can make you say, "He's superb"
Worded perfect, never ever shall you misinterpret
I move styles like bowels so now you know I'm worth it
