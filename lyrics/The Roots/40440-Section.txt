Chorus: Black Thought: (2X)
You can't front, we comin with the shots to pump
We got more cuz it's what you want
Thump it in your section and throughout your section
In your area, throughout your whole section, yo...
Verse One: Black Thought:
dynasty
The lieutenant from the reservoir
I send MCs where the paramedics are
At first, I'm like "nah", I'm nonchalant from afar
Then strike to cut the fake rap star jugular
Known to parlay with Garcia Vega cigars
So never try to duplicate the skills executed
Shine like nickel heat that blow your mind when I shoot it
Some know me as the man that's from the Roots crew
Others as the bad lieutenant of Snyder Avenue
We go an eye for an eye
Behead like a samurai
Who will imply that I lack ability?
Make your words known, amplify the utility
I'm crooked like the 'I' on a toxic malt liquor
The land whipper
the Dom Perignon champ sipper
The bad lieu a bring the bad weather
Be on the low shotgun in the Lex
I'm restin where they handle the Tecs
Brag and boast in my anecdotes that choke
M-Il
Allah
makes the ground you steppin on shivery
southpaw
A yo, the purpose mainly is to generate the Luther Van
controllin your command
All the way live from 2-1-5, all the way live from the 6-1-0
5th dynasty
