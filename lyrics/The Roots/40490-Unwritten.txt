When I think about the good times
I think about yesterday
You can ask me about the future
I don't know what to say
Tomorrow's story's unknown
So listen
It's almost anyone's guess
Unwritten
It was a cold night
Not cold like the winter
Just cold like a energy was in the air
The driver had to dip, so he left me in the whip
Turned around and said, ("You know you're on your own, right?")
a tape revolver
