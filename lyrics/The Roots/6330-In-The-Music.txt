I'm from the illest part of the Western Hemisphere
So if you into sight seeing don't visit there
It's somewhere between Jersey and Delaware
Philly never scared and them niggas ain't timid there
Them young triggers lose lives by the minute there
It might start but the fight never finish there
They all fucked up tryna get the gingerbread
A few stacks be the price for a nigga's head
Cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians
Clips and revolvers and George's and Benjamin's
A celebration of the loss of your innocence
To your old self you've lost any resemblance
They say the city make a dark impression
The youth just lost and they want direction
But they don't get the police, they get the protection
And walk around with heat like Charlton Heston, man
It's in the music, turn it up let it knock
Let it bang on the block 'til the neighbors call the cops
The cops gone come but they ain't gone do shit
They don't want no problems, what are y'all stupid
It's kinda ill how we grip these bitches in the Bonneville
Of course bro like crossbow
It's colder than the North Pole living unlawful
Yo my theoretic is leaded, will come and set it
The shit bang and leave you diabetic, for paramedics
Don't bother me Ock, don't you dare lie to me Ock
I don't know, who's this nigga that you try to be Ock
Joints stiff from rigor mortis
