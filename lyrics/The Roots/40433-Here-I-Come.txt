Here I come
You boys get ready
How much charisma could another one stomach?
If I come outside I'm not running
Go out in a blaze, wouldn't pop one button
I'm a murk half hurt leave the cop dogs huntin
Cause I'm pennin the words that move millions
It's a new bad moon on the rise, who feelin it
Y'all the roots still in it
One foot in the grave
One foot in the toilet
Still I'm onstage
In front of an audience
My ETA
I'll arrive by morning
Money long like the arms on Alonzo Mourning
Dusk to dawnin
garden
I'm in the darkness
Heartless
This peninitentiary
Knockin niggers for centuries
It's elementary
Like KRS and evidently
Bring the tec' out
Turn into a monster
Grouchy
Gimme the Oscar
