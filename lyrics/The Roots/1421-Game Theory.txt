[Hook]
This is a game
I'm your specimen
Downtown Philly where it's realer than a heart attack
It wasn't really that ill until the start of crack
Now it's a body caught every night on the Almanac
Rock bottom where them cops gotta problem at
Where them outsiders getting popped for they wallet at
I had nothin but I made somethin outta that
Now I'm the first out the limo like Charlie Mack
215
it's him the livest one
And he's representin Philly to the fullest
Blacks the realest
If you bout hip hop then you gots to love it
Smokin more reefer than Redman and them damaging MC's
'Riq Geez
You can't have it y'all way but I'd rather parlay
Just smoke og and get cabbage all day
We Black Ink/Raw Life productions
Hey yo I'm tryin to get it at any cost so it's no remorse
When Black step in the door all hats is off
I'll make it hotter than when Shaft in Africa
Jump outta a black Porshe huffin a fat cigar
Night ridin on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff
Voted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full
Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves
All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
Cause I'm the force of the Lord, the rage of hell
You'd rather head for the hills and save yourselves
My Man rip drums
Dreams when M16's with infrared beams
Blowin up presidents' cribs with cans of kerosene
Fuck around and make your town Warsaw
I'm from Illadel the land where the killas dwell
My instinct is of a killer whale bang you up from head to toe
With lyrics I pack like a nine millimal
from Senegal
Used the mike of iron or lead
You choose your mineral
