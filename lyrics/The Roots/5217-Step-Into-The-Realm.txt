Step into the realm, you're bound to get caught
And from this worldly life you'll soon depart
Yo, I walk across this world that's deceptive
Beats are perfected, the ghetto's infested
With more destruction, my vocal eruption
Was speaking bout corruption
M-Illitant
the rap arson, marchin'
Leaving niggas stiff like I'm starchin', departin'
Hollywood Sambos and jokes just like Martin
With a mic and a cord, to hold your head with a sword
They shall be floored when the claps applaud
If this a point of life, one I can't afford
Then I have to get sheist and I deal in fraud
With more drama than a soap opera
I'm from the valley of the heavy-heads
Eyes are crevices, life like a double negative
I rhyme my dirt, Tariq already did
Building this Fifth foundation in the wilderness
entrance
Cypher slaughterer, my mic slapping you senseless
Defenseless, niggas never moving me inches
Aficianado
Gotham
I stroll through your scenery cocked back
Me and Hot Mack, the '98, El Dorado Cadillac Jacks
