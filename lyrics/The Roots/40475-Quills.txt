Don't stop (uh don't stop yo)
Yo, piss in the staircase,
blood on the pavement
I fill the quills with it let it spill on the pages
Compose another anthem for the killers and manglers
Villains and wranglers, fifth still in the chamber
Shit, I'm scientific but my reflex's gangsta
Pull out-rageous arms from the floor of the basement
Then bust 'nuff talons if my peoplez in danger
I'm Larry Davis, duckin' helicopter, hoverin' government agents
The shit the Roots started got these other artists going through changes
Y'all niggas on the titty in your formative stages
Thought, put ass-backwards rappers in a small package
Me and the mic in holy matrimony like a marriage
Yo, the load heavy
We walk around a little edgy, all ready and steady
Withdrawal like Darryl Strawberry
Niggas mad from them ghetto sandwiches and swine
Cryin' hard times, disadvantegeous,
general Hannibal
Don't act shaky and squeamish, if you real make me believe it nigga
Che Gueverra
Don't copped off, create it just save your cheddar
I hit the studio with a pen and a vendetta
Beck
huffin' the tenth letter
Same corrupt city as Mumia the Panther
Yo, I hold the mic that could be thrown as a pipe bomb
Bring it just to sling it at your favorite icon
