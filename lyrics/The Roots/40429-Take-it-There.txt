All the way from South Philly on a wing and prayer
And still bringin' it yeah
I'm from the side of town
Where shots get sprayed around
Where the expectancy rate be twenty-eight around
Downtown battleground where cops parade around
Have your whole view of life beyond jaded
How everybody sick of breaking down, tryin' a make it out
Hand over fist the only way to get the paper down
People tired of gettin' pushed around, gettin' gangsta now
Discipline the only way to bring some kinda change around
Whoever in the dark is unseen and heard
I can feel something close we on the verge
Talkin' bout, to my street sweepers, hotel housekeepers
And my people spillin' this out through jail house speakers
Some people rather use they mics than use heaters
Some people rather lose they life than lose freedom
For real
Society's time bomb laying dormant
Our people disenfranchised from the free world
No democracy
They said one vote equals one voice
But he told you if he can't work to make it
He'll rob to take it
Life quicker than spliff that wouldn't burn right
Yo they got accountin' to do, reamount the balance
Written on a legal pad, poetry that sizzle the clip board
My og, my homey who taught me deal
Said in prayer that's the only time you should ever kneel
