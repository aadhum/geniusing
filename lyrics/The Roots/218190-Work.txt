Spectate. Cost a buck o'five, the net weight
Yo, I bang like them sheist niggas out in the cold
That will snatch niggas up right outside of their home
Yet still it's all a quality song
[?]
Soul is a treasure, it becomes a part of you
It controls your mind, both you and I
Yo I get stopped on the street a lot, people recognize me
Talking stalking walking right behind me
Some of them are genuine fans, some are slimy
Some be coming at me like "I'm ill nigga, sign me!"
Baiting me I'm waiting for you all to rhyme finely
Ask them to spit, their shit be like common
Clones
Black Thought and Questlove
In South Philly son there's heavy gun traffic
Yo I got seven joints, every one a classic sound
Down for the long stretch like elastic
