It's just - hip-hop hangin in my head heavy
Malik said
Riq
you know the planet ain't ready
For the half" when we comin with the action pack
On some Dundee shit representin the outback
(All the way live, from 2-1-5)
You witnessin the 5th Dynasty family click
2-1-5)
(All the way live, from 2-1-5)
(All the way live, from 2-1-5)
We settin it from Southside
pushin this up North
From Illadelphian reps, to fly points across the map
The attractive assassin, blastin the devil trespassin
Master gettin cash in an orderly fashion
Message to the fake nigga flashin
Slow up Ock, before you get dropped and closed like a caption
Fractional kids don't know the time for action
Styles got the rhythm that of an Anglo-Saxon
Round of applause, an avalanche of clappin
{*BLOW*} that's what happen, now what's your reaction
Specialize in science and math and, original black man
Bustin thoughts that pierce your mental
The fierce rippin your sacks and
Vocal toe to toe impeccable splittin your back son
Simple as addition and subtraction
Black Thought, the infinite relaxed one
Shorties say they love it with a passion
Bring the international charm, see a squad I harass
REACT, you best adapt when I sling this rap
Go get your crowd so we can clap out
When I'm in your system like glycerin
Fans listenin, from Michigan to Switzerland
Solicitin, sometimes illicit or explicit with it and
From the deep end where the hills are steep
Nobody cares to speak, a land where life is cheap
The street mentality, mixed with the intellect
Niggas rebellious, bodies are found down in the cellars
My man caught a shot to the stomach, now who want it?
A process of elimination
Activate your mind with the stimulation
Enter your zone with penetration
I've seen more horror than Bram Stroker
You woke the wiser, dealin with the Roots vocalizer
Hey yo, I'm just a lyricist, a chemist of the hemp
The beat pimp, the ill Philly resident
That's far from hesitant
corrupt like a President
Never benevolent but poetically prevalent
Cooler than peppermint
The Lieutenant for niggas talkin bout represent
No doubt, it's obviously evident I get bent
Far from temporary son I'm very permanent
Hittin MC's like an intoxicant
Monopoly is my intent, the means is what I invent
This mental murder pay the rent
Lyrically I'm the dominant ingredient, the swift extravagant
Smooth lubricant, down with the M-the-Ill-itant
M-ILL-ITANT
feel the 5th guerilla chant
Y'all talk about bodies but you would not kill a ant
My skill is amp, would peel a nigga like a stamp
Caliber is of Excalibur now you be damp
When I operate a crowd will copulate
My game'll make a room populate
They all get they wrists slit, blast your ass if you insist it
Leave no trace so there's no trace for ballistics
Turn your soul and body to statistics
In particular I've got that extracurricular
Squad in the stash who could be stickin ya
Slip and they vickin ya
Harass your po-lice commissioner
Don't like chicks with weaves talking 'bout, "I need conditioner"
That shit's deader than niggas with a morticianer
A jenazah
Take away your last breath when you got asthma
Then meet Bad Lieu down at the plaza
tell your man I slump him with a stanza
Now "Who's the Boss?" not Tony Danza
My squad from deuce-four up to West Oak Lane
All the way to Tackawanna and Frankford they know the name
M-Ill-itant
Bad Lieutenant
