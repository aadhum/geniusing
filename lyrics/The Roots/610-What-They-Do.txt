Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Lost generation,
fast paced nation
World population confront their frustration
The principles of true hip-hop have been forsaken
It's all contractual and about money makin
Pretend-to-be cats don't seem to know they limitation
Exact replication and false representation
You wanna be a man, then stand your own
To MC requires skills, I demand some shown
I let the frauds keep frontin
Giving crowds what they wantin
Official hip-hop consumption, the 5th thumpin
Keeping your party jumping with an original somethin
Yo, I dedicate this to the one-dimensional
No imagination, excuse for perpetration
My man came over and said: "Yo we thought we heard you"
Joke's on you; you heard a biting-ass crew but um
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Thin is the line that run between love and hatred
Aiyyo, it's funny when I see some rap niggas do to make it
A few'll blow up, or go as far as they can take it
My nine to five, is just to hit ya get the party live
I'm Black Thought, used to rap for sport
Now the rhyme saying rent paying life support
It's various crews that try to touch me
Around the world crowds love me, from doing tours
Recipient of applause from all of you and yours
Creator of original sounds to send to stores
You take home to absorb and sweat it out your pores
Infinitely go against the grain, that's why my motto's to
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Never do....what they do, what they do, what they do
Living the life of limos and lights
Airplanes and trains, short days and long nights
Keyboards and mics, bass chords and drum kicks
Open your head wide, and let the Thought inside
Mentality undetectable by the naked eye
"I want it made" like Ed
Then after that, I'm putting on my cousin Hamed
And discover, my level is that of no other
And Roots crew reign official and true while I'm continuing to
