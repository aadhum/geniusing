JD
I can't explain the influence that
His mind and ear have had on my band
Myself and the careers of so many other
Artists.
Never without that signature smile and head
Bouncin' to the beat.
Happy he's no longer in the pain he'd been
Recently feelin', I'm crushed by the pain of
His absence.
Name's Dilla Dog and I can only
Rep the real and raw.
Last of the red hot hip-hop lovin' emcees
That came up on grits and
government cheese
Some of my niggas fell in love with MPs
And smack 'em in the melon with another LP
C'mon, help a couple people in the struggle get free
We from the block, where people stay prepared to rock
And it's hard, cause opportunity be scared to knock
And mo' people in the 'hood found dead from cops
Than guns that drop, that sprayed off random shots
But whatcha know good, people say they in the hood fo' good
You ain't a prisoner, the world got mo' to it
Langston Hughes is about as a deep as my thoughts is
Just, picture the planet and imagine it's yours, kid
Comin' up between a rock and a hard, watchin' for God
I'm comin' from all the streets that never been cleaned
And speakin' for any face that never been seen
