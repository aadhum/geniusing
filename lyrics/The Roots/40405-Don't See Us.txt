You Don't See Us, but we see you
You stuck on sleep, get on your P's and Q's
Cause you will get crept, wit no discrept
You know the rep, we keep the flows in check
I'm not the average savage that curse queens
First we handling first things, I'm subsurface unseen
Man each world, it ain't no time to recline
Act up, get clapped up, my mind is the nine
Live twice, got seven more lives to live
Run a rapper through a maze like an experiment
The Raw Dice rise like a creature from out the swamp
I got a gun that's don't bust, it just suck niggas in
I got shit that'll have you begging me to shoot ya
Okay Computer, Radiohead's
Future Shock like Curtis
I knock you out wit one punch from me you been Ali-ed
I float like hovercrafts and sting like vaccinations
