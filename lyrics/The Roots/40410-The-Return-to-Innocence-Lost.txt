Muffled sound of fist on flesh
Blows to chest
No breath
Air gasps
You ain't nothing but white trash, bitch!
With each hit, each kick, each...broken rib
Crack, Crack!
Bones are crying
Mommy's crying and bleeding
Daddy wants to fuck
Dick hard, swelled with power rush
Mommy's seven months heavy with birth
As...Daddy grunts and cursed drunk nothings in her bloodied ear
First...lullaby
First...Son...will...ever...hear
And never forget
Mommy almost bled to death when she have him...finally
She'd already lost...three
Uterus-bruised, shredded, and weak
From being daily beat
Daddy never came with flowers
jezebel juice
But Mommy's prayerful strength-her best defense
She...burned the dirty linens
Made a fresh bed
As she purged her scourge
With birth-blood and quiet tears
Mommy's little survivor
Like...her
One boy soon after
The girl much later and...
Although they were both sung the same lullabies of hate
And him...
Let...sins of the Father cause his Innocence to wander
Found honor amongst thieves
Chose to squander his dreams
Stopped believing in himself
Become prodigal with his life
Make impossible shit right with...
Gang-ties, crime, lies
Brown bottles housed his swift descent
So, eyes wide and glassy
Speech...slowed and slurred
Lips twitched with caked-up codeine candy
Shots were fired by the gray man
With shaky hand
But not shaky enough to miss...
Hit...Lost Boy in back
So-called Friend runs for door
Leaves First Son blood-born
Lying alone in blood on cold floor
Death was the cost of...
Returning to Innocence Lost...
Baby 'Sis awake for dawn on Christmas morn
To Mommy's sobs and shakes
