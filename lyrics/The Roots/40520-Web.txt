And it weighs a ton
'riq Geez motherfuckers I'm a son of a gun
Black master of any trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue
Clear my path and come get your captain hung
Trying to breathe like Black'll collapse your lungs
Young chump you could choke off the web I spun
I done cleared 'em out from the thread I brung
You done heard about what set I'm from
My nigga, word of mouth no rule-a-thumb
Y'all better bow down when the ruler come
I'm a real hood nigga not a hood-a-lum
The way Thought put it down be confusin' some of y'all
Cats can't walk while chewin' your gum 'n all
What a keyboard got to do with a drum and all
School 'em on stage like I'm doin' a seminar
Professional type, I'm addressing my mic
Go to war kid I'll give you any weapon you like
bust off your dum-dums
Stop kid, that hot shit you know where it come from
It's Philly world-wide phenomenon
And reinforcin' that shit is my 9-to-5
You been waitin' on the boul to come off to all
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
To keep you in health, this for all of y'all
I'm quick on the draw like Black McGraw
My name 'riq Geez and I'm back for more
To get more chips than the corner store
With a portrait of Malcom X on the door
Play y'all part - get on y'all P's and Q's
And when y'all think Thought, be prepared to lose
Get took for your tuck right in front of your hens
Because, I put a black fist under ya chin
'riq Geez, akh, y'all can chat what y'all please
Receive what I'm gonna get back to y'all believe
'cuz you don't really wanna get clapped with all these
You see the squad come in the place, they all freeze
Ice Cold, with his mellow Cool Breeze
MCs never showed loyalty yet
Kool Herc ain't never get a royalty check
I do work, no question, and bomb your set
I'm calm collect, sharp like my name Gillette
I'm a decorated vet, I regulate and wreck
Never hesitated yet, I'm gettin' heavy weighted checks
If you would dare ask if I'm dedicated - yes
I don't even feel like I'm not sober yet
If the prize in my sights then I'm goin' for this
I'm the corporate, give me the bulk of this
'riq set it on the magnetic ultra tip
I'm like young LL, cuz I'm hard as hell
Makin' niggas screw face like Gargamel
Now I'm all out on my own like Patti LaBelle
Put the pimp game down on your mademoiselle
