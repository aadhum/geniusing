WHY?? (6 x's)
I'm kinda getting a little tired of all that's hidden
That's the reason I'm a speak my mind, keep from going insane
my peoples steady losin' while the rich keep winnin'
land of money and oil
Funny how ain't none of it yours
It's far from right, I guess that's why it feels so wrong
To see the world get stripped out of every resource
And people pray to Coca-Cola now instead of the gods
Some people chasin' a dream, others just chasin' a high
Some people blind leading the blind, they chasin' a lie
Some people chokin' backs broken barely makin' it by
But still they workin' all they live, they pushin' for the light
Givin' everything they got to stitch them swishes on ya Nike's
Puttin' pockets on our jeans, mining diamonds for them rings
Rewarded with small change and bullets in the brains
If I disappear I wonder if the world will know I'm missin'
Who my support system, it's not the court system
Gotta letter it said that you're not avoiding prison
People 'neath the microscope cause we defining the culture
They smile and insult you like you shinin' their loafers
Like a kid sniffing glue somewhere trying to escape
[Scatting instrumental outro]
