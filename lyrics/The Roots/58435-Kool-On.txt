I’m in the double G, three-piece tux
Screaming dressed to kill
Hope somebody call my bluff
It’s a full house… sipping on a royal flush
Two queens is on my cuffs
Good times is in the cards
Living on borrowed time
I’m paying the extra charge
To feel like something small is worth a hundred large
Swag is on retard, charm is on massage
Wit is on guard, I challenge you to a duel
Who needs a chain when every thought's a jewel
God bless the weirdo when everyone’s a fool
Fuck a genie and three wishes
I just want a bottle, a place to write my novel
I am heroin to those that hear a rhyme and think
upper echelon
Let’s toast to better days
a beautiful mind
and a flow that never age
Yo, I’m never sleeping like I’m on meth-amphtamines
Move like my enemy ten steps ahead of me
Say my reputation precede me like a pedigree
Gentlemanly gangsta steez beyond the seventies
Holdin' fast money
Without running out of patience
Move in silence without running up in places
Cake by the layers
Rich but never famous
In hindsight gold come in bars like a Klondike
The minute before the storm hit is what I’m calm like
Suited and booted for a shooting like it’s prom night
pursuers tried like
To no avail and a heroes what they died like
I’ve got em waiting on the news like I’m Cronkite
No boasts, just bodied and chalked close to the line tight
Yeah outside where the killers and the dealers swarm
And inside they dressed up like it’s a telethon
Black tie affair but they holding heavy arms
Straight cash with a stash in the cummerbund
Bastards of the Party,
Made the quantum leap to a king from a pawn
Serenade of the former slave promenade
Cause them long days in the sun
Have now become shade
So we doing high speeds in a narrow lane
Say cheese
Another feather in the cap for all the years
That we spent in luxury's lap
Without looking back
Cause memories could sting like a hornet
Damn it felt good to see people up on it
