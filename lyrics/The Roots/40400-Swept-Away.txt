The rhythm just sways and like a sorceress I slays
Foes and ri-vals, who wanna come
This way
Trey-eight-o's
The lyrics make your head knock
Malik B and Black Thought, the dreadlock
Poundin on the drums like King Kong
We can ring your bellll, ding-dong
Yo hello everybody do I need introduct
That I capture kid I snatch the mic from tykes
I proceed and continue
go against the grain like freight
I rest where niggas pack and never act
Other than ill, shit is real in Phy-double
