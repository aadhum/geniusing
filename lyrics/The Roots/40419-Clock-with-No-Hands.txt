[Verse 1]
Yeah, sitting in the staircase, holding back tears
Looking over mad years worth of photographs
Pictures of some places I ain't never going back
Some people I used to love, why I ain't show them that?
The skies was overcast, when I was sober last
My head is spinning, couldn't tell you if it's slow or fast
It's starting to get too clear, I got to go and grab
To y'all it's a shame but life is what we know it as
Waiting, navigating the plot, without plans
In the cards,
it's hard to read as a clock with no hands
How your mans gonna get up his stock with no yams
my back bending like I'm sendin' salaat
People think that I'm crazy, just cause I wanna be alone
You can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
We all deal with shit on our own
And sometimes the beef can grow, get out of hand
Yeah, you know it gets full blown
I never said that you mean the world to me
Maybe it's best that you never know
Yo, I'm like Malcom out the window with the weapon out
Searching for somehow to find a minute or the second now
Precious time is money that I ain't got to mess about
the horse's mouth
or from an eyewitness account
Lessons with my back to the wall, scoping my session out
Stay a little edgy at times when I ain't stressing bout
Those that love me send it out, so I ain't got to force quit
Cause I'm doing better now, don't mean I never lost shit
I was married to a state of mind and I divorced it, man
I'm from where brothers moving product from the porches
Yo, living in turbulent times
The blind leading the blind
Some call it evolution, some say intelligent design
You say you want a revolution
red-eye
My brother back in rehab, just had another relapse
Within himself
it's been like he's been fighting an inner Jihad
Telling me ain't nobody true when they pretend to be that
So closer than friends, that's where I keep my enemy at
Until we're able to grow, forever bridges we burn
My thoughts free as a bird
