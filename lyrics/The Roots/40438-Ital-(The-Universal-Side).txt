I wanna be able to reach an MC
And reach a little child in the same degree
I mean what the hell
We might as well bridge these gaps
In all before we fall in the fire
Inaccurate perceptions of reality embedded
In they minds thus they rhymes are discredit (check it out)
When I blast through your section or district
In my formative years by my peers I was influenced
Until the instruments of time killed the congruence
Brothers is fakin' jacks and think they ready for the rev
But they got a lot to learn, to make their thoughts long term
Cause on their short-cuts they made a wrong turn
