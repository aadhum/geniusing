The concerto, of the desperado
R-double-O-T-S check the flow
If you know like I know then you know the motto
That's all the fraud shit got to go/fake shit gots to go
In the glow of the moon, over the melancholy metro
My poetry is set like a U.F.O
The maestro
the lyricist
My physical play the role of a vessel
Of a gorilla stronger than Samson
Without Delilah my soliloquoy profess my ability to just
Stimulate you like the best sensimilla
The halflife
Illadel-L-P-O-phila
Hither is my death I will blow your tower to smithe-
-reens to fiends catch another rhyme gripper
Deeper than the meditations of a Hindu worshiper
Unorthodox, hip-hop, minister
Than a Serengeti cheetah my thoughts swifter
Fifth Militia
A poet's under pressure stressin that you get the picture
Even if it means you gotta hang over the banister
I pull a microphone on any pistol brandisher
And take advantage of ya because you amateur
This how we do it in the year for nine-six
With this deliberate attack on pointless rap shit
Breakin MC's down to fractions, tell your squadron
Respond/React
Treat MC's like the cities of
Sodom and Gomorrah
Leavin these niggas open like a box of Pandora
With styles that's newer than the world order
three quarters of y'all are water
The pil-grimage to the line of scrimmage up against your image
Lieutenant
That surrounds you like a peninsula to snatch the pennant
You fold like Japan's futons and fans
break you up into parts like vibrato
Niggas is sweet and sound silly when they talk on the mic
They use the simple back and forth the same
Old rhythm that's plain
I'd rather UltraMagnetize your brain
It's the hip-hop purist, that leave you lost like a tourist
Inside the chorus, niggas is bringin nothin for us
