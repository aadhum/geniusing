Struck by the luck of the draw
Real life preservation, what I'm hustling for
They swore I'd fall or be another brick in the wall
That's silly, this Philly, y'all really ain't stoppin the bull
With the pen like Willie on top of the hall
Pure soul is what the city most popular for
Hear the tones that will ease you
Smooth as Bunny Sigler's soundtrack
Keepin your head boppin and all
Making somethin outta nothing because everybody fifty cents away
From a quarter where I come from
Yeah, you can take a brother outta South Philly
Can't take it outta him really
I forever represent it
Listening to Ultramagnetic ego tripping
Clap to the record spinning while I'm taking you back
the feathers in the cap of their Borsalino
Pulling paper in as if it's a small casino
Just survival kid, and it's a struggle worldwide, I'm positive
Shit the ghetto might as well be the Gaza Strip
Street walkers, you don't see no consciousness
I'm coming back to where the core of the problem is
