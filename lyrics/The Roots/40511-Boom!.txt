Hold your flix, I'm not for the photo op's
It's Black, code name Yaphet Kotto ock
My twist like a ratchet in an auto shop
Spit pesticides for rats and vermin
and I'm a little better than dopest
Far from a brand new kid to show biz
Tryna hold on, maintain my focus
Coming out the room with a cloud of smoke of dro and
With the punches
I survive and rock
Cause I keep the crowd alive
And the texture of my voice
Is course and kind of hoarse and cut
Party people gather round what we have here is a brand new sound
Reach for my waist you hit the ground
You better duck when that awful sound goes
Boom
Thats what's happenin in the parking lot
Thats whats happenin on stage
The man at hand that rule the school
To suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
Cause I could never let em on top of me
I play em out like a game of Monopoly
Let it speed around the board like an astro
And send them to jail for tryna pass go
I'm live
Homonyms, synonyms good like Eminem's
My brain like a factory constantly creating
Materials stitch by stitch for decoration
My lyrics one fabric the beat is a lining
My passion of rhyming is fashion designing
Now it get sorted cause people wanna sport it ya bought it
Poetry full of surprises it's like a game show
