They say a record ain't nothing if it's not touching
Gripping, draw you in closer make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music
The listener feel like he livin' through it
That's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back in like '91 rapping
Millersville
I be in class dreaming 'bout
50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out
Encore, yo I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga you rollin' with me?
Lot of times at the shows people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside people down with me started to change
It was a couple things, lil' syrup, lil' pills
It's people steady comin' at me out in the street
Like 'Riq, yo, what up with your peeps, it gets deep nigga
you need to walk straight, master your high
Come on, over over the water
Come on, over over the water
we done been through many meals, a couple of deals
We done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels
We done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors
Trying to figure what the fuck we gettin' slept on for
Or what we walking with the weap'-on for
Weighted by the gravity law, you know it if you came up poor, my nigga
I come from South Philly
And when I walk the street it's like a pharmacy
It goes from H to X to loosie cigarette
You burnin' both sides of the rope and just pullin'
in between Islam and straight thuggin'
See'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'
If they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin
Hey yo you better be a true friend to 'em
Before the shit put an end to 'em
Or give a pen to 'em
Or lock 'em up in the studio with a mic
Cause on the real it might save his life
