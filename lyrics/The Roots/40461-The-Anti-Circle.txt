Yo I'm tha anti-circle
Thats verbal I storm
Never comin twice in one form
Tha Black'll act a fool and I'm gone
Crumbs bust it pass tha popcorn
like ganga
How many licks to it take to make a fake
Realize that he can't shake bake or penetrate
This style I demonstrate on a regular
Black Thought so hip that I'm square
Tha rubberband in question just one step away
Don't play cause I'm not tha right one baby
Blacker than tha beans still I never sweat coffee
So yo this trick is for tha rabbit
I grab it and snatch it inspect it like gadget
I works tha magic tha mic I must have it
On a mad train a Black Thought
