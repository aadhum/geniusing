[Hook: Dice Raw]
The Show The Show
It Must Go On
The Show The Show
It Must Go On
I Can't Stop
I Won't Stop
I Will Not
I Will Ride
The Show
a stone to build upon
You kiddin me?
The pursuit of happiness, life, Liberty
And all type a necessities they not givin me
I hit em like ethiopia hit up Italy
King and Kennedy
Like dougie
The world is a show you define ya stage
The Ernest Hemmingway of B-Boy poems
They can never take the pen away of LeRoi Jones
The life I chose is more of a mission
maniac megalo
And break it down like it's the walls of Jericho
