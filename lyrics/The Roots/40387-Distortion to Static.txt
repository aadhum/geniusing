Yo, I'm every MC, it's all in me
Indeed as I distort I proceed, indeed
Getting hotter than sacks of boom in my room at the Ramada
I provide the static, with scratch to match, while you catch the vibe
Most can play high post, but yo that don't mean shit
Because my clique will make a motherfucker sick
I flips, redder than pork, comin to New York to mix
(It's Bob Power) With the snares and kicks to fix
Magiccally I appear, spark a L and drink a beer
With air smooth, takin niggas loot with dice
Vagabond, versatile and various, plus rap styles
five
Foot seven, inches in height
My mission to strike mics and lighten your tights
Frightening, like lightning
Fluorescent, incandescent, effervescently
Very relevant, plus intelligently managin matter
That's makin tracks fatter, revolve around
Saturn like rings
Then distort up in your face like mace
Bustin your dreams like gats with loaded magazines
I'm on the rap scene, repellin fellas like a vaccine
It's the illest out the Phi, short for Philidelph-iada-fly
Dig it, yo my mellow um whattup for the night
(Malik B, get on the mic, get on the mic)
Like that y'all, and yo I'm flowin, my part of the song
It's goin, it's goin, it's gone
Now, go get your dictionary and your Pictionary
Cause much affliction with my diction friction slips and carries
Words and herds like some cattle in the steeple
People, there's no equal, or no sequel
So policies, of equalities, get abolished
Demolished, distortion of the static's gettin polished
Urges of splurge and words will just be merged
Together, damn it's quite clever, however
Approach ya, with Magnetic shit that's Ultra
Nahh them niggas don't want to tangle
Cause Roots get loose, negroes get juiced like the mango
To be particular, extra-curricular, for pleasure
Measure, in any weather, value more than the treasure
