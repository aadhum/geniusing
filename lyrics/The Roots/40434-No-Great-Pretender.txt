cool calm collect in my perspective
Search the premises, I leave no clues for detectives
You talk about you see me, but your vision's full of cataract
Bad luck I walk under now show me where the ladder at
as if you had a sac
Your vocal chord is fraudulent, and not the true porcelain
I bring the fire, earth, and the source of wind
The force of sin will endorse the pen
We all search for sanity, but I think that it was lost again
Next I'm in the womb like a placenta
Strategic, I bet y'all niggas can't believe this
I read you like a whole avenue that's filled with meters
Punks, fuck your back talk, I watch how niggas cat-walk
Over my pit of venom and send em to the asphault
For inquisitives, who wanna try to test me
What protects me, will make you shake like epilipsy
Stimulate more than Ecstasy y'all niggas check my recipe
excuse the greed don't want a mill'
I want a zillion - stacks of Franklins to the ceiling
Even when in the cut niggas can't cut they anxiety
cause I can't stand
Courts or tennis, my pigmentation is the menace
That's why the system's always tryin to pursue with a blemish
Pale asses, think a nigga in this
Fam I won't befriend ya, cause I'm no great pretender
