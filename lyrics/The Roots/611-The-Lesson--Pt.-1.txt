Shoulder the mic, still feel colder than before
With this jazz shit I hit your jaw
Dice Raw, get up on the mic, my young poor
I be the nigga blowin up the spot on tour
[Verse 2: Dice Raw]
Ya leave niggas missing in action like their dads in the projects
My style like an old mac
they bore
Niggas didn't play like Jeru and Come Clean
Or 808's cause my style flows out great
Pull a metal chair out my knapsack across your back ka-crack
Dice
Nigga de Raw
I slam like Hulk Hogan,
If you wanna know better ask BR.O.Th.E.R ?
