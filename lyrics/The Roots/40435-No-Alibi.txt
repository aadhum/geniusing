Dig it, look into my window, tell me what you see
The M-illitant school of philosophy
Connect my sentences and thoughts like apostrophes
it ain't no stopping me
Until I fulfill the term of my prophecy
My attitude is scarred by this inner-city urban
Iller dolo stress on my brain just like a turban
I even speak to geeks, I hold my fortune, it's sweet
I lay low, but over your head just like a halo
Hell's angel, these thoughts you cannot untangle
When I drop jewels, niggas, they wear them like a bangle
one time for your mind
Lieutenant university of philosophy
While you not possibly escaping what I'm meditating
My shackle of thought tackle you while I'm educating
Your dome's resonating, from inhalation of darkness
As I spark the smart shit
Situatin' me at the top of the pile
Wild Delaware file, Pennsylvanian, sub-terranean style
champagne
King like Evelyn
The programmer bringing lashes 'cross your back
On some accuracy of a brainwashed Bosnian troop
On a lyrical Nat Turner mission,
That means you artificial and my style'll poison your brain tissue
Gettin' maimed and crippled once the gamma rays hit you
My grains habitual and I should never go against
The ritual I've been mastering ever since
I was among the flavored youth, remain sharper than a saber tooth
My deliverance is self-evident
Vital, lyrical science (now)
Who knows what you snorted?
Or who support what you recording?
But don't get it distorted, in this orbit you're aborting
Styles, they get sported my paragraphs aortic
illest medley lock you in the choke hold
Slice tongues from your area code
Student of life, that's on the rugged exterior mode
I walk the thin line and hold mine
It's mind detect mind,
the sextillion tons
Your Armageddon gwan come from the sun
Untouchable cuts that's unclutchable for some
To overstand,
so y'all sit back and wonder damn
I like to take this time to show you who I am
Original man
lieutenant
M-illitant
Known to vanish in the atmosphere
We up there like the stratus
