through the sirens, the lights is blinding
Battle cries sound off, warriors dying
Hands up, that's a massacre the cops kept firing
keep y'all eternally crying
Fed up, place red stains on global giants
The brain of an Orson Welles
Stuck in a masterpiece, Citizen Kane's personal hell
it's hot where them hustlers dwell
And the air bears the stench of a corpse's smell
Homie down on his luck one foot in the jail
The final paragraphs to the book's last page
You could feel it coming, no running away
Let's get free or let's get paid
These cats Chef like they Isaac Hayes
This is what you ain't learning in school
A loaf of bread, milk and eggs, stick of butter man
Somebody's mother lies dead in the gutter
Sheriff down by them heads, talking that Gullah
Tell the kids don't look under those covers, man [x2]
For his life, the tide high in the eye of the storm
And I hate to speak about it but it's all freakanomics
Cramped and proud of it
Treading water trying to lift up your head without drowning
But you pushing for the top, too scared to stop
The television getting all the information wrong
Doing how they do it getting they mis-education on
Somebody been was 'posed to regulate
Instead of wait before they let the levee break
is any nigga safe?
