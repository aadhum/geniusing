Yeah, U.N.I.Verse
At war
U.N.I.Verse (when you and I verse)
Chi-town
(Illtown illanoid)
(preacher man with the Com)
Get on the mic talk about cars and clothes
Sounding like hoes
Ain't been exposed to the foes(4's),the moes, disciples
I'm from the state that is Ill
the rap son of man
Rotated down to Phil, to say what I feel
Get it off my bird chest, my word becomes flesh
War, going on between the West and the East
Of the land, niggas don't own a piece
Grease is the word, Murray slides some pimp oil to me
My lady friend sneaks my beer in the movie
Throw your hands in the air
Nah that ain't nothin I would call my mother
Nor do I call every nigga my brother
Gotta have Black Thought, it's sorta B like Malik
So don't Question a Brother, to the Roots I get deep
Verse Two: Black Thought
I bring hip-hop terror like the Fuhrer
The Ace Ventura into the horror
I'll struc-ture a style destroy your whole aura
And mortalize, my image hit the skies
I'm thinkin fast like Rama-
Dan, I wear your mind away like Alzheimer
I pull a mic up out my bomber
the fifth dynasty
Del-val-syllable stylist
Yo, the general flows, kids compose on tablet
Expose how they was average
And they thoughts not rapid
Here comes the hot package, through your block like traffic
The rock was typed graphic now watch the mic blast it
See the mirror shatter from thoughts, I'm bustin back at it
The Lieuten-ant
the ele-phant
Mic, rippin asiatic, architects out to have it
The turn of the century, the planet's like a penitentiary
Exaggerated, niggas is livin highly medicated
I Used to Love Her but now she violated
Hip-hop holocaust and camps, old champs are concentrated
They outdated and incarcerated
Loved and appreciated hated and very debated
Every Block is divine
Some let the block, block they mind, if they could see what I see
My, neck of the woods ain't all good ain't all bad
You can live in the burbs, and still get had
For peace we skate, crackers be rollerblading on hate
Call each other cuz cause of how we relate
I see way too many Cadillacs with dope man plates
Harmonizing through beeper and reefer
