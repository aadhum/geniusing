If you a obstacle she just drop you cold
Cause one monkey don't stop the show
[Verse 2 - Cody Chesnutt]
If Mary drops my baby girl tonight
I would name her "Rock n' Roll"
Where we heading for? She don't know
And I'm a god-dang rolling stone
And this weighing a ton and I'm a son of a gun
My code name is The Only One
These streets he done ran
Ever since when the game began
And I don't scream and kick
When his shit don't fall in my hands, man
Fertilize another against my lover's will
no pill
You'll be keeping my legend alive

[Hook 1 - Cody Chesnutt]
I push my seed in her bush for life
It's gonna work because I'm pushing it right
