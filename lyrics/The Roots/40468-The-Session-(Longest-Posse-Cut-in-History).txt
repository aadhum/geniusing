From The Roots sprout the Foreign Objects family tree
[?uestion/Ahmir Thompson] Mr. Basit, a.k.a
[MB/Malik Basit]
Malik Blizzunt, Foreign Objects
Now get loose, get loose, Malik B get loose
And just rock heartbeat showin you got juice
And have fun (HAVE FUN) have fun (HAVE FUN)
Have, HAVE, HAVE FUN!!!!
I will just slay and disobey, I will display banana clips
That slaughter with the words and the herds of the verbs
I gots the urge to splurge, like a Bosnian Serb
Shakespeare
Mark Twain
Edgar Allan Poe
But since I'm a ne-gro, I flows like Maya Ange-lou
So lock up, your doors, cause I'm
Busting Loose like Richard Pryor, setting stuff on fire
Can I kicks it?
Introducing lyrics for the year of ninety-three
Eatin buds or mad grass that gets you HIGHER than a bird
To the erector of the Foreign Object, I collect, to preserve
And we out y'all, and we out y'all
And we out y'all, and we out y'all
And we out y'all...
