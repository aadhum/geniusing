Raw, that's what every soldier in my collective is
Thought, control level is that of a gold medalist
My level headedness make it come off so effortless
The rebel is a opposite extreme of devilish
A genius slash gangsta with a skill for swindling
Bet these cats that's all gelatin
Smellin' your blood now I'm huntin'
Blowin' your front in for frontin' what up cousin?
I flip like my name Turner
That's for certain nigga, Ted Turner, Nat Turner, nigga Ike Turner
The raw sojourner for truth
The mic burner
Mic malevolence defies violence I inherited
rentin' it like rooms at the Sheraton
And y'all cold like a show in the Netherlands
Cold shoulders and frozen aortic valves
Gifted - use it to shift shit a mutant shape shifter when I spit it I'm liquid
You could lick a million shots at the character of the body shell
They'll just richochette nigga aura's hard as hell
Before there was ain't hard to tell
The mic's cycle coincided right with mine as well
Fox logo if your fave is local
Get bruised till you're the color of the Laker's logo
I made it - ain't nobody believe in me
But this rap game is like selling coke legally
Killin' mics is one of my aesthetics
Rip very live so I'm an entertainer like Cedric
