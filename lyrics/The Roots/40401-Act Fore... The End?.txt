Arigato, to all my people in Japan
Cartier or Pierre Cardin
To crush carbon copy MC's wit clone jargon
Move the crowd to leave the microphone sparkin
Cold Crush like Charlie Chase
You just a sloe gin fizz kid
The Fifth Dy-nas-ty, that's the slogan
From S-P to West-P to Logan
Relax to my man D'Angel-ist
Jerome
We veterans, lyrically threatening freshmen
Y'all lookin at next year, I see the next ten
