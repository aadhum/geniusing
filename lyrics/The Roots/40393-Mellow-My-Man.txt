Coolin out with my man Malik B
We in effect
Mode like Al B. Sure, for your plea-sure
Bust it, La Di Da Di, who likes to party
Like Slick Rick the Ruler I'm cooler than a ice brick
Got soul like those afro picks, with the black fist
And leave a crowd drippin like John the Baptist,
it's
The cause of that "Oh shit!"
And got many emcees on the blacklist
I'm sharp as a cactus plus, quick to bust gymnastic tactics
Now holla to the scholarly, street skats that follow me
Back to the Soul Shack with packs of rap colonies
Max that, Foreign Objects
make Shadrach
Offender wanna go like Meshach
Cool as Malcolm Little with conch a la perm burn
Agatha Christie - you're slain and know now
Next contender, Malik's the axe offender
Critique me so uniquely with mystique that's so deep within the
Microphones I grip, psych with poems so's I slits throats
Put him in a quote, when he croaks
They sayin -- isn't it, is it the negro that did it?
Cause wreck with the tech, make you jump and say 'ribbit'
you can even ask Anita about the, rap-ture
The way we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
No no we do it like this
That, for my mellow my man
It's like that for my mellow my man
No no we do it like that
This, for my mellow my man
It's like this for my mellow my man
Jump Like Punks, to Get
Beat Down
Deeper than the pool that Wilt the Stilt Damn near drowned in
Sweats no sex, cause this kid gets
Grits n shit,
Back is the Black Boogey Man
I rocks my flocks of sheep, it's the slickest shepherd around
I was lost but was found
From Philly to the Apple I,
stop and holla tunes
Up-town, Diggin Planets when they get Earthbound
Change my name to Saran or Reynolds then I Wrap em
Cause my ass is so thorough, like Levert Gerald
Too strong to be sterile
So I impregnates the greats (say what?)
I won't smirk, cause my name's not Urkel
The voice with the multiple choice, she does a circle
You wanna turn and page your eyes, and try to plagerize
But I degrade ya, slaughtered ya and slayed ya
that ain't *shhh*
It was a curse, but I divide it in half
Gets the airplay, no fair play,
Because I have the habit to smoke rabbits like a addict
So if you can not rap I will just slap YOU
For Scott Storch, my mellow my man
Leonard Hubbard on the bass, my mellow my man
Brother question on the drums, my mellow my man
