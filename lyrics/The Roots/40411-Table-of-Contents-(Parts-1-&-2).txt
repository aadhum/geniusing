My voice physically fit, tracks I'm bench-pressing
The mic chord is an extension of my intestine
South Philly through my arteries
Thought the dark one
The Fifth Dynasty
Last seven years on tour without restin'
Yo the kind of rapper you should reconsider testin'
Dundee attire for MC hunting
y'all loud as Don King
That I'm one of the illest in the seven continents
Bad Lieutenant
Toxic words that spill over pages, for ages
Impacts like M-16's to twelve gauges
The rage is still in me, never actin' too friendly
Scully down creepin' while you tilted off Henny
And scramble, because this game life is the gamble
Roam the planet, always takin' bullshit for granted
Whack your MC for ten thou' cause I'm for hire
