Bass for your face
highs for your eyes
I'm puffin this Cohiba
The bathrobe on with sweatpants and slippers
Hip-Hop my main bitch, I got a few on the side
Tryin to play it cooler than a polar bear colony
I got the soul of a young Sam Cooke when I spit
the Jakes
They wanna know where the drugs guns and cash be
Probably wanna get me to run, so they can blast me
Riq Jizzle
It's not a thang when I lower the gradient lens frames
I'm cooler than Clyde Stubblefield, drummer for James
