One one one one two P-P-5-D
Yo, on these seventy-three keys, of ivory and ebony
I swear solemnly that I'll forever rock steadily
People wanna know where Malik, he right next to me
I bayonet cassettes and chop beats with
This olympic lyricism you can't, compete with
Globe traveling, throwing your verse like a javelin
Things Fall Apart
and MC's unraveling
Backstage whispering to management like
Change the order, it's no way that we can rock after them
My man sport the 'fro like What's Happenin'
From the latest hi-atus, The Roots back again
Your crew practicing to catch this natural blend
They packages read, care when handling
It's all soft shit, batteries not included with
I blow your ba-tty ass into fragments,
P5D
Yo yo Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
Malik B, I represent the P-phi-D
Black Thought, I represent the Fifth Dynasty
The Milli-illitant-tant
Power out
Smashin 'graphs, snatch the ice, crush your mental device
Just blendin in the great
Between the killers when they probably Teddy Ruxpin soft
Droppin tears of steel, two drops up in the bucket
Facing three hots and a cot so yo fuck it
If I get abducted, trapped up in the belly
Wacked up my celly
get known like Dawn Staley
While you pose for pictures, I'm the invisible enigma
Down low, scope you off the roof like the fiddler
Watch, while I'm banging out this hot shit from Sigma
Illa-del-P-A
live without a DJ
And it's been that way, since Sergio Vallente
Chinua Achebe
Illa-Fifth Dynamite
