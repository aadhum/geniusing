my area code
All sorts of episodes in my area code
Where the blocks explode, where the temperature is cold
ride strapped and unload
I seen it unfold in my area code
Just push the panic button on your remote control
got the old heads froze
They peepin outta closed windows
They not secure as they supposed I watched it all unfold
As this manic-depressin un-load with his gun hold
Guns traded for sensi and hash,
crack for ass
Entire crews pass not makin the news flash
Whatever Ave. transform to the war path
Pure wrath from North down to 24th and Task
Streets tainted with camouflage - guerilla sabotage
My cousin's Jarette and Todd, was livin type large
Got caught then blast crashed off on Broad and Lombard
So many so-called hearts scarred they buried in the yard
Stick up kids is jumpin outta plated Dodge Rams
This is for all of my niggas, that are R.I.P.'s
You ain't missin nothin, life ain't what it should be
I'll pass across soon
You remember Tauseen nigga thick slice of dream
Go out fast for the buck do anything for the cream
Never seen a case like this, although it's quite contageous
He even got his little brother actin all outrageous
From dusk to dawn, and from dawn back to dusk
They do anything and everything, tryin to come up
It's kinda sickenin, how the cash is so fuckin addicted
And when I say son wild they say that that's conflicted
Ain't nothin but a contradiction in this world we live in
Cause the loot is for the takin, and not for the givin
Then the youngest one, will say "I'ma die hustlin
Fuck everybody except my brother who I'm trusted in"
I guess the young boy just did not know the truth
Cause the following week Tauseen threw him off the roof
kids get whacked for somethin less than a pat
Thought he was his brother's keeper
from the P.M.'s to A.M.'s
America's worst nightmare -- guns in kids' hands
The year when niggas rolled with sheepskins gazelles and kicks
Even got the patent leather Adidas snatched off your feet
Strolled in the dollar house parties; in search for Cinderella
Was just a little man real bold
H-R-M Ogontz Ave. Brickyard to hollow
Niggas was snatchin gazzeles and flippin pockets for the dallo
You wore your little rope chain in West Oak Lane
And niggas from Logan came to extort we know the game
You proclaim this gangster bullshit talk
And never even seen your man shot, or bodies in chalk
