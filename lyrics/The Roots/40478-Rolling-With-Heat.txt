Mr. Rourke on your Fantasy Island
BK to killer Cali
You softer than Land-o-lakes
Transforming the landscape
Like a sandstorm in the Sahara
Pyro-maniac like Dr. Molotov
I'll fucking bounty hunt your body like I'm Boba Fett
With the blood, ice your watch, rock your rocks
Better rock it on the screen and not the blocks
Cuz them crews don't stop them shots
I'm from the south side of philly, it's known to get gruesome
Introducing the B-to L-A see me the king splitter
Then analyze this dime, the main thing glitter
Then analyze the taste in your mouth, it seem bitter
