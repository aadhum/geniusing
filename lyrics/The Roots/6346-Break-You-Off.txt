Bad Misses, Throwing raspberry kisses on me
You looking for directions?
Girl I feel your vision on me
And when I'm breaking it off
Its no denying the fact it's wrong
Cause you got a man who's probably playing his part
You probably breaking his heart
He trying to figure the reason you gon'
Is it because he's superficial
Or is he too submissive
Or did I come along and hit you with the futuristic
Late nights, twistin' somethin' listenin' to niecey sing
Rollin' down the highway, listenin' to Sade sing the way the smooth operator move my way
You sitting beside me
Looking like Friday Foster
Pam Grier structure look at your body
Kisses like Hershey
But lips is sealed
Cause we don't need the controversy
I say I'm in town, You say you want it in the worst way
You probably told your man it was your it was ya lil's birthday
Meanwhile, Its champagne chilling in ice
You ready for the freakiest things you done in ya life?
Prepare for flight, this is your captain
I'm getting strapped in
Theres no denying the strength
Of'dis attraction girl
Working with this you won't be taking a loss
So stop fooling your man and roll with the one
Who's breaking you off
