All the way from the 2-1-5th to Bucktown
Runnin one on one and only hip-hop band
Yo Tariq (whassup) how your micraphone sound
We got to blow up the spot
forget
We double (trouble) bubble (bubble) bubble (bubblin hot)
The vocalist, busting this blunt instrument spit
The magnificent, rappers run from it
Aiyyo I stop fools and drop jewels but never run it
All you high noon riders better rally at the summit
It's me and Tariq and your fleet outnumbered
Cross the membrane,
barking big game and get hunted
Your get your kings, your rooks, rings and pawns tooken
Aiyyo, keep your tape rolling so you catch every bar
black man from Black Star
Illadelph and Vietnam we conference
Yo, a lot of Smurfette MC's carry purses
And rock uniforms that's made for nurses
Only touching surface, the FUCK's the purpose?
I shot the sherriff, the deputy, and head of bank treasury
So mounties in the county got a BIG bounty stressin me
2-1-5th to Bucktown
Yeah, now check your stove top before you take a listen
And make sure beans don't burn in the kitchen
These gassed-up niggas just ain't fuel efficient
I play the winter breeze to choke hold your piston
Now you niggas can't make pole position
Class E chassis can't hold the transmission
Crew pit useless, they got they tools missing
Watch me, Grand Prix, champy for wealth driven
A lot of MC's said I'm a run it down rhyme
But half the time, they running down one of mine
What I memorized leave your whole staff pressurized
Melt down all of your artificial lies
Y'all niggas is faker than Yellow No. 5
Swine like mono and diglyceride
I'm nicer than your writtens even when I'm improvised

We go back to dollar hoagies and Tahitian Treat
Or like toast in the oven with government cheese bubbling
Me and Dante
like Marvin, The Troublemen travelling
B-boy business, off the top acting and battling
Serving them cats that forgot
But don't get too close, because you might get shot
Do You Want More?!??!!
[Mos Def]
Say here's a little story that must be told
About two young brothers who got so much soul
Ahmir on the beat
Fortified Live
Like zen-zen-zen-zen-zen
Zen-zen-zen-zen-zen, zen-zen, zen-zen
Let the poppers pop, and the breakers break
Two years ago, a friend of mine
