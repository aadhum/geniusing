Fuck.. kill.. and prosper
Is the gospel of Wonderland
where
Street sands, are quick..
To suck you down to the abyss
With the lure of pure bliss if you kiss the dicks
Of the niggas?
Never.. Nosferatu's
Those witches and warlocks in blue
keepers of the First Zoo
Unauthorized player, in the capitalist contest
To see who "Gets Money"
No milk and honey, in this land
So it's play dirty or die by the hand
That's holding all the guns
Plunged, deep into religion was my first decision
To save me and my daughter's lives, but
I can't thrive off spirit and scripture
The picture grew clearer;
I made the move to rear her
In a life wanting for nothing
So I got into this drug thing
Sealing fates and, healing struggle gaped, wounds
Izm was just too small time
So I sold cock hits and, alleyway thigh splits for two bits
And, once strong now bony backs and stretched out
Weary racks of snatch, in other words..
.. I sold crack
Morality was buried deep, beneath the new Jeep
Silk sheets and money heaps
Still the good mother, I sent my daughter off to
Boarding school to keep shit under cover
All the while envisioning myself, a champion of ghetto causes
Plus his, game I was playing, and winning
While sinning, against myself and soul to get the gold
I was the Female Don, the Crack Queen
I went buckwild, wanting more
Like the pipe worn whores I began to deplore
No time for playing with my coochie
Counting my man's mad lucci
While he was up inside some hoochie's loose piece
I thought my shit was tight..
.. til my empire started to quiver
Taking every chance, under surveillance, being listened to
And watched, like Assata Shakur
Loose lips flipped the script
My jaded vision, busted like a cherry
I fucked and, I killed, to prosper
Upheld each tenant, of the ghastly gospel
Shift to a different Wonderland to pay the price for my vice
lillies in this field
Plenty of fat uniformed rats with
Below average size cocks that slither
Through cell locks, in the night
Lactating tits
being licked, left and right
Plenty of coochie,
burning with desire
Like black churches in the South
Black prayers and pussy on fire
Penned up behind barbed wire
Me and my fellow female mammals, animals
Bitches in cages, bodies racked with hormone rages
Just blow my head
