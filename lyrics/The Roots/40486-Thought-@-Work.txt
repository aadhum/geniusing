You wanna see Black? Then jump on it
You see Black fall back son
Me and Shock up in a black Regal no insurance
We like DEA serving warrants
So tell the freaks you know to stop whorin
Yo where the safe Money unlock it, pull it out your pocket
Ben Banniker Bay with the Al Morrocan
Black Thought on capitals like the sovereign
Yo ill insanity that's cold and morbid
Brown Hornet
I'm like Imhotep but don't flaunt it
Fuck getting money for real, get freedom
Waddup nigga T3 nigga Baatin
When the M-Ill get home we're gonna win
Come from South Philly where the hammers are clapped
Violate and you will answer to Black
You a thug not really there's the answer to that
Lee ya, boxed silly with the hands skill attack
Who can test the ground when I finesse the sound
