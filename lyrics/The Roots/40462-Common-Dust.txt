Ashes to ashes, and dust to dust
It's Common Dust y'all, and you don't stop
For you to trust y'all, with real hip-hop
Thought be the pillar of the styles of speech
Teach I aims not, just to talk my sense
Damn I gives not, 'bout the consequence
Funk the Stylistics
cause I'm stayin alive
Time I grips not, so it limps along
Dust you, collect if you digs my song
Connection L-7
Common spear-a-mint, it's like sense is Dust
if the force is with us
