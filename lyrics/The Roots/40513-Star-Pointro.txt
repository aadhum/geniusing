Get 'em up high - okay, yeah
In Philly, Cincinnati, Los Angeles or Harlem
Kids call theyself killers let they hammers do the talkin
Don't even know the meaning of life, ain't seen a thing
And you dream of floodin the scenery with
llello and greenery
you stickin her with the heavy machinery
Wonder how, you lift it up, be only 17
And like e'rybody he wanna shine, young brothers on the grind
Holdin somethin in they spine, "Bowling for Columbine"
"The Tipping Point" has arrived, and that's the bottom line
Yo, ain't it strange how the newspapers play with the language
Hip-Hop, it's not pop like Kylie Minogue
If it bang, them gettin-busy brothers probably involved
Introducing the band you gotta see to believe
Where e'rybody's a star, and hot shit is few and far between
We lose the grip of what, garbage mean
Don't wanna do the Ruben Studdard and come off less threatenin
You act like you want it, you gon' end up gettin it
"Everybody is a star.."
[Echoes and fades into an instrumental that ends the song]
