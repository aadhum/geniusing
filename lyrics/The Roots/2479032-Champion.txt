Success in life comes when you simply refuse to give up
On a mission so strong that obstacles like failure and loss only act as motivation
When something's telling me to stop, I never do that in the name of love
Until I've given it my all and it just ain't enough
Nah, you work hard 'til you're better off
24/7, 365, never off
Look at me, I'm nocturnal, I don't sleep
My eyes heavy, bags and crow's feet
But I won't be stopped I go from tragedy to majesty
The victory has been woven into my tapestry
This ain't the type of opportunity that just appeared
I made it here because I shed blood sweat and tears
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
If you a champion, show me you a champion
If you a champion, show me you a champion
Cause real champions move like champions
And real champions prove that they're champions
I fell in love with the game and never look back
My foundation and frame, they never shook that
Been trailblazing my name into the book that
Represent all the champs who had a chance and took that
I'm a pillar like a column in the Pantheon
