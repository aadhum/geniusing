Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage and scream for more
All I see, pussy galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me
Yo, my old head once said, it's more powerful than cocaine
dancin' in a line like Soul Train
To get your pride up, that extra push
Niggas lookin' for the time of their life, coppin' a rush
Lorraine know it's real, and sex controls America
Turn the TV on, it's in the open on the regular, yo
What the freaks in the video for?
Fuck a song, gimme a thong, and pussy galore
desire and lust can make a man kill
Or jump off the bridge, cuffed to a motherfuckin' anvil
it's promoted like it's all y'all know
Keep a nigga under the spell
And been many an empire rise and fall
From the squares to the players
To the pimps to the whores
To big checks that never would have been endorsed
I sit back and just peep thangs
9 outta 10, it's the same songs, only the beat change
So don't be lookin' at Tariq strange
When I conduct a little Litmus test up in your heat range
That's when you see me up on stage with six
Wicked ass chicks fittin to get crunk with this
fresh cut, with the thick black velour
With the black Louis sneaks, headed out for tour
Lookin' out the limo window up at the billboards
200 miles, she was the only thing I saw
Promotin' everything, from the liquor to the nicotine
Cell phones, anti-histamines, chicken wings
catch a bid far worser than a 1 to 3
