You ain't fly
You ain't fly
You ain't fly
So go 'head, witcha self
I'm just playin the wall, I'm just playin the wall
sugars
Yeah the young sis was stacked wicked
I flipped when I seen her eyes, bloodshot green
She said she wanted riches and a nigga with cash

"Excuse me Miss, excuse me miss"
"No, I'm not havin it!"
As she walked away, man I couldn't deny
Started lying to myself, man she wasn't that fly
[Hook]
